[470.00 - 473.00] and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead
[473.00 - 476.00] and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead

[482.00 - 485.00] and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead
[485.00 - 488.00] and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead
[488.00 - 491.00] and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead
[491.00 - 496.00] to help me you know try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just
[496.00 - 503.00] trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue
[503.00 - 506.00] to provide for them comfortably.
[506.00 - 509.00] What did you study at school?
[509.00 - 512.00] I studied communications actually.
[512.00 - 520.00] I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now I'm studying
[520.00 - 522.00] business.
[522.00 - 524.00] What made you decide to do that?
[524.00 - 532.00] I just thought that you know there would be more opportunities for me with business as far
[532.00 - 538.00] as jobs and then I have a desire to go to graduate school so I just figured in the long
[538.00 - 546.00] run it would put me in a better position, give me more opportunities with the communications.
[546.00 - 552.00] It's a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of TV reporting and things
[552.00 - 561.00] like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so I just thought I would go into
[561.00 - 566.00] something more realistic and you know but I like both fields.
[566.00 - 567.00] I really do.
[567.00 - 573.00] I like communicating, writing, reading, talking as you can tell and so we'll see.
[573.00 - 577.00] What's your dream job?
[577.00 - 584.00] A couple probably but I would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a
[584.00 - 592.00] travel writer, going to different destinations, trying different foods out, writing about
[592.00 - 600.00] different people, cultures, learning and living you know about those different people and
[600.00 - 610.00] cultures living amongst the people there and being interactive with the children and
[610.00 - 617.00] stuff like that so I kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something
[617.00 - 622.00] along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor, social worker, something in
[622.00 - 623.00] that area.
[623.00 - 626.00] If I could encompass all three hopefully I can.
[626.00 - 628.00] I would like to do that.
[635.00 - 642.00] That's actually a hard question probably because I initially grew up very shy and I'm not so
[642.00 - 650.00] much shy as I am reserved now but not conservative but just reserved and you know when I go
[650.00 - 656.00] somewhere I'm checking everything, everybody else out and then once I become comfortable
[656.00 - 663.00] or acclimate to a situation then I'm like okay you know I warm up to the situation or the
[663.00 - 665.00] people but I'm also friendly.
[665.00 - 667.00] I can be very friendly and outgoing.
[667.00 - 669.00] I like to talk.
[669.00 - 675.00] You know I seem like a chatterbox but I'm not really so usually if I'm in a big space with
[675.00 - 678.00] a whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention.
[678.00 - 686.00] I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but overall
[686.00 - 688.00] I am an open friendly person.
[688.00 - 713.00] For me it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything, all electronics
[713.00 - 721.00] and just sitting for a few moments meditating, praying or reading a good spiritual scripture.
[721.00 - 732.00] If I'm able to I like to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, you know things that will
[732.00 - 735.00] I kind of like the physical part of it.
[735.00 - 738.00] I like massages, things that really release tension.
[738.00 - 746.00] And if not then just like I said just sitting at home reading and praying or I like the beach.
[746.00 - 751.00] I love the beach so sometimes I drive and go sit by the beach.
[751.00 - 760.00] I also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani-pedi or maybe go window shopping.
[760.00 - 762.00] You know things like that.
[762.00 - 769.00] Pretty good.
[769.00 - 774.00] Sometimes I'm just like I don't really have so much issue with the temper as I am.
[774.00 - 776.00] I just I'm more impatient.
[776.00 - 784.00] Unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so I just can become really irritated
[784.00 - 791.00] or irritable, quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me and just lose patience.
[791.00 - 795.00] Outside of that I'm actually pretty good.
[795.00 - 802.00] I try to be very conscious of where I'm at and be very patient with people especially if I can see that the person is
[802.00 - 812.00] like if they're a new checkout person at the counter or cashier I do try to be patient and understanding
[812.00 - 817.00] because I would want that you know if it were me I would want someone to extend that to me.
[817.00 - 822.00] You know with my kids sometimes you know it works both ways too.
[822.00 - 829.00] If it's that time of the month I'm just like just leave me alone or I might have a short temper or a short fuse.
[829.00 - 831.00] So I am conscious of it.
[831.00 - 839.00] I try to be aware of it and try to monitor it but you know like anybody I'm human in their times or I have my days
[839.00 - 844.00] or moments when I could just like go off and just lose it.
[847.00 - 850.00] What was the last time you argued with someone?
[850.00 - 861.00] Um well I haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been an ongoing thing with American Express.
[861.00 - 873.00] So I would say because it was not a personal contact but a company I we it really was an argument but you know I had some
[873.00 - 882.00] issues with American Express I had to call in about on I think Saturday and I kept I wasn't getting the response I expected
[882.00 - 891.00] and so I would the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and I was upset and you know the rep was trying to over talk me
[891.00 - 893.00] and then I was trying to over talk her.
[893.00 - 899.00] So you know I don't know if you would consider that an argument but I would definitely say that's the last time when you know
[899.00 - 908.00] I just kind of like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that was the closest you know to an argument
[908.00 - 910.00] and then had to call back this morning.
[910.00 - 917.00] That one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two.
[917.00 - 922.00] Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.
[922.00 - 930.00] Probably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express.
[930.00 - 933.00] Actually it was on Sunday.
[933.00 - 942.00] Yeah and I know the person was trying to help me but you know when you're constantly being told different things
[942.00 - 948.00] and I've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved.
[948.00 - 950.00] It just takes you there.
[950.00 - 963.00] So just I kept raising my voice said some things I shouldn't have and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact.
[963.00 - 968.00] I like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there.
[968.00 - 970.00] My blood pressure was raised.
[970.00 - 972.00] Excuse me.
[972.00 - 977.00] And that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that.
[977.00 - 980.00] Just irritable and agitated and upset.
[980.00 - 990.00] And so I always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback
[990.00 - 993.00] and see how I could you know handle things differently.
[993.00 - 1000.00] But that's one I definitely wish I could have kept my cool and been more level headed and not really raise my voice
[1000.00 - 1003.00] and you know been more polite.
[1003.00 - 1005.00] Okay.
[1005.00 - 1009.00] Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.
[1009.00 - 1016.00] Hmm.
[1016.00 - 1026.00] Well I probably have had a couple but probably the most is a situation years ago when I just had my sons
[1026.00 - 1033.00] and they probably my twins they were probably about two and I was in a situation with their father again
[1033.00 - 1038.00] and became pregnant and it just was not a good time.
[1038.00 - 1044.00] And he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time.
[1044.00 - 1052.00] And I wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby.
[1052.00 - 1061.00] But he put me under so much stress and you know kind of I want to say really pushed me into having terminating the pregnancy.
[1061.00 - 1070.00] And that's always stayed with me and I've always missed that pregnancy that child I think about that that baby or what could have been.
[1070.00 - 1075.00] I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it.
[1076.00 - 1083.00] But I know deep down I secretly if I had it to do all over again I would have just I would have kept the baby and move forward.
[1083.00 - 1088.00] So that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally.
[1088.00 - 1097.00] I could deal with a lot and I have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know a lot of financial problems.
[1097.00 - 1102.00] But that to me was the hardest.
[1103.00 - 1104.00] Thank you.
[1106.00 - 1107.00] No.
[1110.00 - 1111.00] No.
[1112.00 - 1114.00] How have you been feeling lately?
[1114.00 - 1128.00] Okay you know I was laid off in December so I've been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet.
[1128.00 - 1130.00] So that's been a little tough.
[1130.00 - 1138.00] I've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school.
[1138.00 - 1151.00] So my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place about five years ago.
[1151.00 - 1161.00] Well she's been able to move forward and going with her life and now she's graduating in next month from USC with her master's in social work.
[1161.00 - 1172.00] So I'm feeling a little envious of that and I have been for like the past year but more so recently although I'm very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it.
[1172.00 - 1178.00] But you know of course you've done a lot of what she was me so that too has kind of been bothering me.
[1178.00 - 1186.00] Hi Ms. Lola. What would you say are some of your best qualities?
[1186.00 - 1197.00] Well I'm really good with people. I communicate well. I like to talk. I'm really good with children. That's why I would like to teach or be a counselor.
[1197.00 - 1203.00] Although I have not really tapped into it I know I'm a very creative person.
[1203.00 - 1209.00] I know I write pretty good. I could possibly be a creative writer but I know I'm very creative.
[1209.00 - 1215.00] So if given the opportunity I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills.
[1215.00 - 1224.00] Something like with maybe songwriting, fiction writing, probably like interior decorating.
[1224.00 - 1230.00] Anything artistic. Just anything because I love music. I love the arts. I love drama. I love plays.
[1230.00 - 1237.00] I'm not a big fashion buff but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that.
[1237.00 - 1244.00] So I think those are my strong points as well as just getting along with people.
[1244.00 - 1250.00] I know I will make a great counselor. My friends come to me all the time. I have a good ear for listening.
[1250.00 - 1255.00] I'm a great mediator and I know how to because I've been through a lot.
[1255.00 - 1260.00] One of my friends called me the voice of reason. The one that's actually graduating from SC.
[1260.00 - 1267.00] I know I'm light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom.
[1267.00 - 1273.00] I don't know if it has to do with having older parents myself or how I grew up.
[1273.00 - 1278.00] I had very traditional southern parents who instilled a lot of great values in me.
[1278.00 - 1283.00] Or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign, I'm a Pisces.
[1283.00 - 1288.00] I'm really good with people. Just period.
[1288.00 - 1295.00] Like I said, I have my moments but I know if it's something I could go into and develop, I would do well.
[1295.00 - 1300.00] Is there anything you regret?
[1300.00 - 1305.00] Not really. Some of the situations.
[1305.00 - 1310.00] I wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children.
[1310.00 - 1315.00] Picked a different partner.
[1315.00 - 1319.00] I say that because my son's father is great.
[1319.00 - 1324.00] A great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me. We're not together.
[1324.00 - 1329.00] I'm just saying overall.
[1329.00 - 1334.00] I think I would say, if I could let me backtrack that, not finishing school when I should have.
[1334.00 - 1339.00] Not following my dreams and goals and doing things as I was planning initially.
[1339.00 - 1344.00] I think that would be the one thing I could say I regret.
[1344.00 - 1349.00] Not following my goals and finishing school on time and pursuing what I really wanted to do.
[1349.00 - 1354.00] What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?
[1354.00 - 1359.00] Stay focused and finish school. Pick a career path and stay on that.
[1359.00 - 1364.00] Stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you.
