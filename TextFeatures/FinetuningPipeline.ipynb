So I'm going to go ahead and start up the virtual human that you'll be talking to. When it's over, will you just go ahead and ring this bell so I know that it's done? Okay, great.\nWill it let me know that I'm done? Yes.\nOkay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? I'm doing alright.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally? Originally, I'm from California. I'm born in Glendale.\nNice. How do you like your living situation? I'm not too happy with it.\nWhy? Just unemployed at the moment. But I'm actually seeking, doing what I'm supposed to be doing. There's some prospects there, but hopefully I'll learn something today.\nIt can be tough to find a good job these days. Do you have roommates? Yeah.\nWhat is it like for you living with them? Well, I have one as a girlfriend, so I consider her a roommate. Lover type thing.\nOh. How close are you to them? We're pretty close.\nHow do you know them? I met her last year. We've been through some troubling times, but we're starting to see a light at the end of them.\nThat's good. Tell me more about that. The troubling times?\nYes. Let me see. Well, I got into a DUI last year and lost my job. I'm a truck driver by trade, so that kind of threw me way off. Having a $1,400 a week job and then going to nothing. Plus losing my license really threw me off. I haven't really found anything that I was interested in, so I started cooking. I was trying to see which other route I could go as far as having some kind of a career. I'm choosing to go into the culinary field, but meanwhile I still have to work. It's hard to find a job without going to school. I applied at RAL, so hopefully I'll get that job. I should have that job, actually. I'm starting to see a light at the end of that tunnel now, little by little.\nThat's good. What's your dream job? My dream job would be probably forestry service. Out in the wilderness.\nHow did you decide to do that? I have a lot of love for animals. I'm an exotic animal trainer by trade. I don't like people too much. Being outdoors, I've always enjoyed being outdoors. That's how I like being a truck driver. I've traveled the world. I don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or in an office. I'm more of an outdoors type of guy.\nYeah. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips would be, I spent a year and a half in Japan on the lower island there. They built that bridge, the largest bridge in the world. I went there to work for an all-white tiger act, working for the Japanese circus. It was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of Americans. That was one of the islands also that they bombed. There was a lot of negativity, but I pretty much have a good outlook on life. Especially during those times. I enjoyed myself, all the traveling and meeting new people and eating different diverse foods. It was a good experience for me. All that whole experience was pretty good for me. Traveling around with circuses. It's been great.\nNice. What are some things you really like about LA? There's not a lot that I like about LA, but I like Hollywood. I like the movie industry. The huge... different ethnics of people here. I enjoy talking to a lot of foreigners. I like to see where it came from and what it's like there.\nYeah. Traffic's ferocious. Yeah.\nWhat are some things that make you really mad? Traffic. Ignorance. Being disrespectful or whatever. Other people being disrespectful towards you or other people. That's about it.\nOkay. When was the last time that happened? It happened on a daily basis. It seemed like... I ride the bus a lot. Or if I'm riding my bike, people tend to almost run me over. I'm not totally paying attention to traffic. I find myself sometimes having to wait to see what they're going to do instead of I having to ride away or stuff like that.\nThat sucks. Yeah. Big time. What do you do when you're annoyed? I probably sit there and vent. Speak my mind even though a lot of times it's by myself. Just like assholes or whatever. Wishing that I carried rocks in my back pocket so I can... It happened so much where it just amazed me at what people would do sometimes. You almost get run over. I probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis. If I wouldn't pay attention, I'd be up shit creek.\nYeah. How hard is that? It's hard with dealing with people, especially trying not to react because there's consequences to your reactions.\nYeah. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? It was with my girlfriend and it was about being honest. I'm pretty honest with... I'm open and honest about anything and everything. What it was about was just her lying to me, telling me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something in that aspect. I come to find out a week later that it was a total lie. I just didn't like that at all.\nYeah. How did you feel in that moment? Let me see the word for it. She just said, I don't know now whether I can believe anything she said. I felt hurt that we'd been in a relationship for a little bit. That's probably one of my biggest pet peeves is being honest. I don't hold back. I'm pretty honest with anything and everything that I do or say. If you're lying about something, you're always having to cover up, moralize with the lies that you already told. It took a lot from me trusting her now. Now I'm like, is it truthful? Is it not? It's kind of hurt our relationship.\nI'm sorry to hear that. It's not involving. What are some things you like to do for fun? Fun? I like going to the beach. I love shooting darts, but I haven't done it in a while. I love to paint. I got into watercolor painting. I'm pretty gifted at that. I want to try some other mediums. I love fishing. I haven't gone in a while though. I like driving a truck. My job, I really, really enjoy it. I don't like driving through cities, but usually when I'm in the middle of the night, I see all the stars. I like stargazing. I see if I can pick out some of those astronomy stars up there. I'm a pretty easygoing guy, so shooting pool, sunshine, just what I like.\nThat's great. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Probably playing with lions and tigers, wrestling a baby elephant in a mud puddle.\nOh my gosh. Just enjoying myself. Awesome. How close are you to your family? Not. I don't have much family as it is. At least here in the States I don't. My mom's from Central America. But I'm not close to. I have three brothers, one sister, and I'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings. I speak with one brother quite a bit. My other youngest brother, I just rather not, I converse with him, but I try to keep it on a professional basis. My sister I don't talk to at all. My other brother underneath me, I haven't spoken to him in years. So I'm just close with my mom, my niece, some of my nephews, and that's about it.\nOkay. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yes.\nTo avoid them? Yes.\nYeah, I just don't talk to them. I don't call them. I don't ask about them. I talk to my mom quite a bit, my brother quite a bit, but I just don't bring up those subjects. Or if they are brought up, I just usually say, you know, that's on them, and I really don't want nothing to do with them. What does that mean?\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's been hard lately. It's been probably hard for the last, going on a year. You know, it depends on my thought process at the time. Like I said, I've been looking for work quite a bit. So just wondering why I don't get calls. I just have racing thoughts. So, or I get depressed, you know, or I worry about things that, you know, that really I have no control over. So, you know, lately I've just been sleeping a little bit too much. At least for me, because I'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a night, and now it's changed to about eight to nine hours, and I'm still tired. Do you feel that way often? Lately I have been. Probably about the last few months.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. If I don't sleep well, then I just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me. So, you know, I'm more of a guy, I love the work. And if I'm not, then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head. And so, you know, like if I'm busy, if I'm doing what I, you know, in whatever job I do, I kind of, you know, get into it. I enjoy it. It's something new for me. And so I can think about, you know, either work or I can go home and then think about this. You know, I don't have to worry about, you know, money, you know, bills getting paid. And I can just concentrate on other things, either doing the things I like or maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend.\nHow do you cope with them? How do I cope with them? I just try not to think about it. It's not about whether coping with it or not. I just do. It's I'm more of a guy that just, you know, it may take me a moment to say that I'm coping with something. But, you know, if I have no control over it, there's nothing that I can really do about it. The only thing I can do is continue to do what I'm doing. And that's actively looking for work, actively going out on interviews, talking with others about work so I can just kind of, you know, get back to, back to basics. You know, I just don't let a lot of stuff bother me. It does bother me, but I try not to let it continue bothering me.\nYeah. Has that gotten you in trouble? My moods, I mean, yeah, money. I mean, you know, my past, I got a past history, so which kind of tends to bother my, my hiring process. I don't know if I'm going to get hired, so I got to deal with different, different type of employers who are, say, felony-friendly and stuff like that. And I try, you know, I've taken classes on, on how to interview, how to answer some of the questions, which, you know, come up quite a bit. And I kind of reflect back on that, but I just, I got to keep putting it into my head that that's not who, who I want to be anymore. So, or, you know, I've done, I've done my time, so to say, but I took the time, you know, the last time I just took a lot of time and, and tried to work on the issues that were bothering me. So, you know, towards positive stuff, I got my GED, different things, took a lot of classes, thought about going to school, looking to go into school, and anything that would kind of change my old ways and, and try to move on to more productive activities.\nMm-hmm. That's good. Do you feel like therapy's useful? I still didn't hear you.\nDo you feel like therapy's useful? That people have been deceitful? Can you repeat that one more time? Why don't we talk about that later? All right.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? I've been diagnosed with bipolarism.\nHow hard is that? It's tough if you don't, you know, I don't medicate, so, I mean, I have been on medications before in the past, but again, as I try to live on, I try to live life on life's terms, and I just, you know, I know the medical establishments always want to label something, and what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills. You know, I've been on probably every manageable pill that there is for that, and, you know, some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough, and so I just try to cope with things with just my life skills, you know. I don't want to be using drugs. I know certain drugs work for like three to four months, six months, and then they go, well, here, I'm going to try you on this, or I'm going to try you on that, and it's just an ongoing process, and I probably for about the last two years, actually about three years, I kind of just said, you know what, that's it. And whether it's different than, or if I would be on meds for it, I don't think so, you know. It's still the same stuff. I still get the same problems, and I still get the same anxieties as if I was on medication for it or not, so I just, you know, deal with it, you know. Sometimes it's not good. You know, I get irritated at people a lot. I don't like people. I don't like crowds. I don't like obnoxious people. Usually I'm going to be quiet, so. But I got a person, you know, it's not to that personality, but I think people can see me and just say, don't mess with this guy, or, you know. But still, you know, I like, I ride public transportation quite a bit, and you know, you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there. Sometimes I got to get off the bus. That's how I deal with people, because if I just know there's consequences if I didn't deal with it that way. So I just let it go. I'd rather take the time on getting off the bus, waiting for the next bus, and hopefully it's not that bad. Did I have a problem before I got out? Well, I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out. The thing is, I know other people, I have a lot of ups and downs. So I know a lot of, in my younger days, people would tell me, you know, when I told them that I was diagnosed with bipolar, that a lot of remarks were like, oh, that's what's wrong with you. We wish that you would have found that out years ago. And like I said, I don't think the meds really work, but what I do, I think time kind of, you know, getting older kind of, you know, makes it work. You know, me dealing with life.\nHarvey? I talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while, recently, and it helps a lot, you know, just to get out my anger, my thoughts. A lot of people, other people may not understand that, but a therapist is, I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out, whatever is bothering me, whether it be people, you know, other issues, you know, whatever the case may be, I just think talking about it. And they're such good listeners and can come in, you know, they give me the same advice that I would give myself or that I would give to others. But it's always helpful to hear from somebody else, somebody who supposedly has, you know, are, you know, they go to school for this.\nRight. But it's good to be there. It's so good to hear. Yeah. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Well, I don't go anymore, so I kind of miss it. You know, like I said, I miss it a lot, actually, but it's just one of those things, I just deal with it accordingly, you know, if I ever get a chance to go through therapy again, I probably will.\nWhy did you stop? Well, monetary reasons and, you know, I don't have health insurance. There's a lot of things that, you know, I'd like to do, but I can't, you know, money situation is not that great right now.\nI'm sorry. How do your friends describe you? They would probably describe me as an energetic, outgoing person, once I get to know people. I laugh a lot. But it would probably tell you that I'm also very serious and a hidden person. I don't reveal a lot.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my boss. One of my bosses, when I first started with exotic animals, he was real, you know, he was German and they didn't teach, I don't know what he saw in me, but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and showed a lot of confidence in me and also built confidence in myself. And sort of let me know that there's nothing that I really can't accomplish if I put my mind to it.\nThat sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and shut this down and take your mic up and then we just have a quick post for you to",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nI was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which has been tough to manage, especially since I choose not to take medication. I've been on many medications in the past, but I felt like they were just experimenting with me and none of them really worked for me in the long run. I prefer to cope with life using my own skills. Even though I don't medicate, I still experience the same anxieties and problems. I get irritated easily and don't like being around people, especially in crowds or with obnoxious individuals. Lately, I've been sleeping too much and have racing thoughts, especially concerning my job search. When I don't sleep well, I dwell on these things. I used to go to therapy weekly, and it helped me to get my anger and thoughts out. I miss it, but I stopped going due to financial reasons, as I don't have health insurance.",

I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Where are you from originally?\nLos Angeles, California.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nThe Southern California lifestyle, the beaches, the active lifestyle.\nOkay. What are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic, the pretentious people.\nYeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nMy teachers.\nTell me more about that.\nI don't know. Certain teachers got... Spiritual teachers that I find a lot of guidance from.\nWhat are some things you like to do for fun?\nI like to skateboard. Awesome. And just stay active, stay healthy. Anything that's outdoors and active and healthy. Hiking, biking, rollerblading, skateboarding.\nThat's good. Do you travel a lot?\nNo.\nWhy?\nNot really in a position to travel financially.\nI understand. What do you enjoy about traveling?\nIf I could, I'm sure I would enjoy seeing all the different cultures and places and meeting all the different people and all the interesting structures and food.\nYeah. What do you do to relax?\nI meditate. And I sit down. I meditate. And I skateboard. Well, I can meditate on my board.\nCould you say a little more about that?\nI meditate. It helps me relax. Sometimes if I don't really feel like skating hard, I'll just go for a nice sunset skate and meditate, a nice two hour skate and just relax.\nThat sounds like a great situation. How hard is that?\nIt's not that hard. You just gotta get to the skate spots. I usually like skating. There's some good skate spots in LA, streets in LA. The beaches is always good. Nice. Just, it's really not that hard at all.\nOkay. What are some things that make you really mad?\nThe situation with my life right now, I can't find a fucking job. I just need a job.\nIt can be tough to find a good job these days.\nI don't even care about a good job. I just need a job. Anything that pays. Just gets hard after a while.\nYeah. Can you tell me about that?\nI mean, I applied from anywhere and everywhere. From entry level to management to anywhere in between. I can't find a job. I can't get a job. I'm trying.\nYeah. I'm sorry.\nIt is what it is. Do you feel down?\nYeah, it's pretty depressing. It's hard. It sucks.\nYeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nIt isn't.\nDo you feel that way often?\nYes, that happens often.\nWhen was the last time that happened?\nLast night I couldn't sleep.\nWhy?\nJust thinking about my situation. A car payment was due yesterday. And I just, I don't know if I have what it takes to continue to do this. You know, I survive day by day trying to see if I can eat at the end of the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression?\nYes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nAbout three years ago. Four years ago. Couple years ago.\nWhat got you to seek help?\nMy mood was just not right. I was always feeling down and depressed and lack of energy, always wanting to sleep. Lack of interest. Do you feel like therapy's useful?\nI've gone to therapy. It has been useful for me in the past. Is it useful for me now? I don't know, I don't have health insurance. I would love to talk to someone. I just feel like I don't have anyone. So I don't depend on anyone.\nYeah, I'm sorry. Did you think you had a problem before you found out?\nOh yeah, I've always felt depressed in my life.\nWhat were your symptoms?\nLack of energy, wanting to sleep a lot, lack of interest. My appetite was uncontrollable, either lack of or I was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things. Having noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?\nYes.\nCan you give me an example of that?\nMy sister just passed away.\nI'm sorry to hear that.\nIt's all right, six months ago. And I became homeless and jobless two weeks ago. Homeless and jobless two weeks ago. And I got to a point where I just missed her and I wanted to be with her.\nYeah. How close are you to your family?\nPretty dysfunctional family. You know, really can't depend on them. That's why I just depend on myself, so.\nThat sounds really hard.\nIt is what it is, what are you gonna do?\nYeah. I'd like to give up, but my parents just buried their daughter six months ago. They don't wanna bury their other daughter. So. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nI don't know. I don't know, I just, I just haven't had good luck. I was a corporate manager for 20 years. And, who would've known 20 years ago what advice I would've given myself because I tried to commit suicide instead of returning back to work. And so now it's just, it's been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and get my life back together. I don't know what advice I would give myself when I started with my corporate job 20 years ago. Okay, I didn't know I'd be here 20 years later. You know?\nYeah. When was the last time you felt really happy?\nReally happy? A couple days ago this week, I've been trying to make ends meet. I've got a lot of things prouding. I've got a lot of things that are happening for me, but I need like two more weeks here in LA so I can connect the dots. But financially I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. So I was happy because I was getting callbacks. Things were starting to look up for me, but it's just time again isn't on my side. So my car is packed and I'm hitting the road and I'm taking off and I'm leaving LA. How would your best friend describe you?\nLoyal, emotional, strong, and a little bit of a\nDo you consider yourself an introvert?\nI have been lately. I was an extrovert for 20 years when I was a corporate manager. And now I am quite an introvert and I stay to myself.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nCircumstances in my life I don't feel as confident. I don't feel as charming and as social.\nOkay. What's one of your most memorable experiences?\nI don't know. It's hard to say. Can't really answer that one.\nOkay. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nThank you.\nGoodbye.\nBye.\nOkay.",
         "Okay, here's my story with depression, in my own words:\n\nI've struggled with depression for years, officially diagnosed about three or four years ago. But honestly, I think I've always felt it to some degree. It got to a point where I realized my mood just wasn't right. I felt constantly down, lacked energy, wanted to sleep all the time, and lost interest in things. My appetite was either nonexistent or completely out of control.\n\nRecently, things have been even harder. My sister passed away six months ago, and just two weeks ago, I became homeless and jobless. There was a point where I just missed her so much that I wanted to be with her. My family isn't really a support system, so I feel like I'm completely on my own.\n\nI used to find therapy helpful, but now I don't have health insurance, so it's not an option. It's tough because I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to. I even tried to commit suicide once, instead of returning back to my corporate job. Now, I'm just trying to pick up the pieces.\n\nI've been feeling really down because I can't find a job, even though I've been applying everywhere. It makes it hard to sleep, especially with things like car payments looming. I was feeling happy a couple of days ago because I was getting callbacks for jobs, but I don't have the money to stay in LA long enough to follow through. So, I'm hitting the road again.",

         "Should I move my arms around? So that just shows that it's active and we know that it's active. Okay, so now I'm going to do something with you. And now I'm going to start up a virtual chat. I'm going to ask you some questions in the chat with you and when you're done, show us how you're done. And I just go ahead and bring you in.\nDo I push a button to start or does she start on her own? Okay.\nImpressive. Yes.\nFine, how about you? Here. Yes. Okay. Yes.\nThe weather. The weather mainly. Not the people, but some of the people. Stuff like that.\nNot as much as I used to. I used to be in school and travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that, but I'm not in school right now. But later I'll get back into school and I'll travel more. But right now, no.\nI don't enjoy traveling.\nGood question. You're actually pretty good. I studied physics and aerospace engineering, but physics mainly.\nYes, I am, actually. Right now I teach community college physics and astronomy. I'm doing research in physics also because I like that type of thing. I'm going back to grad school. Hopefully that's why I'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire.\nImpressive. A professor at a place like USC or UCLA or something like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest. You are actually pretty good at this.\nWho's the first one that you were happy with? There's a lot of people. The first one I guess is my AP physics teacher in high school. Even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major, he still was a very good influence. He told me that school was not about a grade but about learning.\nHow are you doing with your life? I'm pretty good, I think.\nWhen is the last time you had a relationship with your boyfriend? I'm single so I don't get into many arguments. But it's probably my brother about he doing some things too and playing a video game together. I know I'm pretty old to play video games but that's actually pretty good. It's probably something like that. Being angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right, that's all.\nWhat places do you see your parents? I see them pretty often. They're getting older so I help them with groceries and things like that. My brother, same with them. My sister, I tutor her kids, my nephews. I see them about once a week also. Yes.\nI spend a long period of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody. That's introverted.\nWhat do you do for a living? I guess I play video games and I work out. I work out, I think, a lot. I try to at least.\nWhat do you do for a living? I close my eyes. That's about it, I think.\nWhat do you think is the biggest problem? Bad parenting. Parents are more self-centered, more into themselves, unlike previous generations. Parents aren't being parents, in my personal opinion.\nWhat do you think is the biggest problem? I guess... the thing is what's the real problem?\nWhat kind of Yawn does it take? Thank you.\nI don't really have a best friend. I'm biased obviously, but they are really good in math. I'm not really sure if you can't, not saying you can't get better than me in math, but the thing is, it's just that you get a certain confidence with it, no matter what it is you need to learn in math, you've always figured it out.\nI am patient, I think. And I am disciplined where I can spend many hours reading books that might not be important, but they might be important. I have to do it anyway. That's how I think.\nWhen I have a good workout, I'm doing well in video games, small, middle things like that. When something happens with my research type thing, mathematical or physics type thing, when it goes well, that puts me in a good mood. Thank you.\nRight now, it's a fact that research, that I did make it this far research-wise, that's all.\nInteresting. When you start off in school, you read about Einstein and things like that, he says general relativity and you hear about particle physics, you have no idea what it is, you know it's very complicated, things like quantum mechanics. And you start realizing your interest in that, but you're not sure if you can actually make it. And eventually, each step of the clock, time goes by, as time goes on, you get closer and closer, eventually you make the goal, you realize you are just not as good as Einstein, but you are up there, you can do research in physics, you can add to mass knowledge in science, and that's impressive that you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid. Okay.\nA few weeks ago when I got a good grade in a class. Thank you.\nCan you ever say it in English? Yes, briefly.\nMany years ago, yes.\nHow did you start doing that? I don't know, just growing up I always thought that was my dream when I was a kid, that's why. And I just went about doing that.\nHow did you get into the field? I was a National Guarder, I think about 18, 19. I got commissioned at 20, 21. I was only in for about a year, so I left at 22.\nDid you grow up in the field? Yes, not really.\nDid you grow up in the field? I don't think I did. I think I did. I think it's just something that I grew up already expecting to be, so it didn't really change me as much.\nWhat did you do in math or physics? Graduate school. And physics. Okay.\nHave you ever been in a math class? No.\nHave you ever been in a math class? No.\nHow did you get into the field? It depends on how I work out really hard the day before. If I work out pretty hard it's bad, but if I don't work out it, I don't know, it's hard. I guess moderately. Thank you.\nYes. It's okay. I'm probably like I am now. Normal, I think. Not as happy about everything, but still pretty okay. I can still function.\nHave you ever been in a math class? No.\nMaybe slightly. Sorry. No. Yes.\nYes, I have changes in my thoughts. Okay.\nWhy not? I'm applying to grad school again. It's been a while. And slightly apprehensive. Happy that it looks good, but apprehensive that it might not be good. Things like that.\nWhy not? What do you mean by that? I know it's a computer, but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school? I understand. Okay.\nI agree. No, not really. Probably keep doing what you're doing, even though I'm not that old, believe it or not. 20 years ago I was probably 15. No, no. Almost 15. Just keep doing what you're doing. I think I was very lucky in the way it worked out. If it was a little bit different, I don't think it would have worked out so well. Even though it's not perfect now, I think we're doing really well, personally. Thank you.\nSame here. Goodbye. I'll keep this on. Take this off now? Yeah.",
         "Okay, here is a summary of my experience with depression, written from my perspective based on the provided transcript:\n\nI wouldn't say I'm overwhelmingly happy all the time. I'm pretty normal, I think. I can still function, though. I do have changes in my thoughts sometimes. I get slightly apprehensive, especially now that I'm applying to grad school again after a long break. I'm happy that things look good, but worried they might not be good enough. My mood is definitely influenced by external factors. A good workout or doing well in video games puts me in a good mood. Success with my physics research also makes me feel good. It's more like I'm functioning okay, not necessarily feeling intense happiness.",

         "Okay, great.\n\nOkay. So now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and ask you some questions. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. I'm going to put the doorbell right next to you. So you can ring the door once you're done.\n\nDo I see her?\nYeah, you'll see her. There she is.\n\nWow. Here's your doorbell.\nThank you.\n\nOkay. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and to welcome them on you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully welcome. Are you okay with this?\nYeah. Yes.\n\nSo, how are you feeling today?\nFine.\n\nHow are you?\nI'm great. Thanks.\n\nWhere are you from originally?\nBorn and raised right here on the west side.\n\nReally? Venice Beach. Awesome. What's the things you like about LA?\nEverything. The beach, the weather.\n\nOkay. The girls. What are the things you don't really like about LA?\nNothing. Okay. Traffic maybe. I can't even remember.\n\nWho's someone that's been a positive employee?\nMy family. I'd love to hear all about it. My mother. She's a very good-hearted person. Gives me good advice.\n\nThat's good. What are some things you like to do for fun?\nFamily comes first. Family's number one. Go to the gym. You know, exercise. Go to the beach. Party every once in a while. Watch basketball, football. Okay. Take trips. Go to Vegas.\n\nWhat's the last time you had that?\nWhich one?\n\nWent to the gym last night. I have friends that live in Vegas, so I go there often. Enjoying the travel?\nI just take a trip, get out. Get away from the city for a minute. But I'm a city boy, so it can't be way too long. You know, head up the city.\n\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI don't go to the beach.\n\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nOh, that's been a problem over the years.\n\nWhat's the only thing you worry about?\nI don't know. I just have a little anger, I guess. Anger management problem.\n\nWhen was the last time you had a problem with someone?\nProbably only yesterday. I forget what it was about.\n\nWhat do you do when you're in life?\nI go to the gym.\n\nWhat are some things that will be really annoying?\nPeople.\n\nTell me more about that.\nI don't know, just people. Just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes.\n\nOkay. What's your dream job?\nDream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Plan Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far, the past 10 years. Then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX. I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA Airport.\n\nNice. What's one thing that most number of people experience?\nWhat, working at the airport? I guess during the holidays there was some girl that worked there. I had a crush on her, but she turned out to be a lesbian. She's beautiful. Yeah.\n\nHave you ever served in the military?\nNo.\n\nHave you ever been diagnosed with a disease?\nNo. I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No.\n\nWhy did you stop?\nI just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped.\n\nI'm sorry you're late.\nNo problem. It's not your fault.\n\nDo you think it's their disease?\nExcuse me?\n\nDid your parents just help you?\nIt wasn't when I was a teenager.\n\nTell me more about that.\nWhat, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know?\n\nHow have you been doing lately?\nI'm not going forward as fast as I want to.\n\nThat sounds really hard.\nYeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is.\n\nHave you done anything to avoid it?\nTo avoid what?\n\nGoing forward?\nI guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would.\n\nExcuse me?\nYeah, I guess.\n\nAre there?\nYeah, it's like mood swings, I guess.\n\nMood swings? Are you triggered by something?\nIt could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know?\n\nWhen was the last time you had a mood swing?\nOh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today.\n\nReally? How did you fool around with me?\nAngry.\n\nHow hard is it?\nYeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know?\n\nDo you think you're going to be able to control it?\nNo. Okay.\n\nHow are your best friends?\nMy best friends? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay.\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nThe goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially.\n\nCan you give me an example of that?\nOh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted.\n\nThat's great. Thank you. Is that even your address?\nYeah. Yes.\n\nCan you give me an example of that?\nOh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay.\n\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nWell, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then.\n\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nTo do what?\n\nWhen was the last time you were in the house?\nI don't know. Today. Happy to be here.\n\nThat's great. What are some things that you really put into your life?\nUm, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah.\n\nWhat would you say is something you've best followed in?\nMy best qualities? Just that, uh, qualities. Just that I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What do you mean by qualities? What comes to your mind? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay.\n\nI think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay, bye. Can I take her home with me? Is she, um, is she supposed to be a psychiatrist or can I hire her? Okay.",
         "Okay, so, looking back, I think I've dealt with some stuff, especially when I was younger. As a teenager, around 14 or 15, I remember being very restless and destructive. I even went to rehab after doing some time, but I ended up escaping and going back to jail. Lately, I feel like I'm not moving forward as fast as I want to, and it's hard. It's like I have mood swings – I can snap over something small. It happens all the time, even yesterday or today. It's related to anger, and I struggle to control it, especially when I'm dealing with unpleasant things in my life. My friends see me as outgoing and humorous, but they know I have my issues and understand when I get mad easily. I'm proud of the goals I've accomplished lately, like getting my GED and my job at LAX, but I regret some of the decisions I made when I was younger, like not staying in school and joining a gang. If I could give myself advice from 10 or 20 years ago, it would be to stay in school and control my anger.",

         "Okay, so now I'm going to start at the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and then when she's done she'll let you know.\nI'm going to put the doorbell back over here and then you can let me know when you're finished.\nYou can just ring the doorbell when she's done talking.\nYes.\nFine, thank you.\nMontreal, Canada. I moved here with my mom when I was in high school.\nYes. Oh, it's very cold there in the winter and our summers are very short.\nIt was very easy. I custom pretty quick.\nNo, not very much anymore. I don't have much family in the United States. It's pretty expensive to go back home so I only go every couple of years.\nMeeting different people, different places, different customs. Well, we just recently went to San Francisco, same custom and everything, but the city was very different and I enjoyed it.\nI took general education and child development. Right now I work part-time for an independent auto repair shop.\nI'm a very good driver.\nJust working with people, talking to people.\nNo. I'm shy sometimes so I stay to myself a lot.\nI walk along the beach, bike riding.\nArrogant people. I try not to get angry but sometimes I do try to learn. I'm learning to walk away from things but sometimes people provoke you. I'm getting better. I'd say 75% under control.\nAbout a month ago with my daughter and her finances. It's really hard. You don't like arguing with your children.\nI have two girls. One is 23 and one is 26. One lives in Louisiana and one lives here. Now that they're older, yes.\nSatisfaction of giving love to someone else.\nWorry. Well, unfortunately when I was young my sister was kidnapped so when my children were growing up I worried about them a lot and I didn't let them do things a lot on their own. Now it's easy because they're grown and they live on their own so it's a lot easier now but you still worry even though they're grown.\nI'm sorry, what did you say? Oh my goodness, they're spoiled rotten. They have everything.\nWaking up when my kids were younger on Christmas Day I loved it.\nNo.\nYes.\nIt's been exactly two years and two months.\nLoneliness, depression, especially after I didn't have any family members left in the United States so I went to counselor and then the group therapy.\nYes. I mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your likes, your dislikes, your problems and sometimes somebody else is going through the same thing you are and you can share what you're going through and what can help make it better.\nHow has seeing a therapist affected you? It's affected me a lot. It's helped me cope with things. It's nice to have somebody else to talk to.\nYes, I didn't want to admit it but after a while and feeling depressed for so long I knew I had to do something.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Pretty good.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just getting more positive, better.\nThat's good. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's not. It's about 50-50. Some nights I sleep good and some nights I don't.\nThat sucks. What are you likely to do to improve on? Lack of energy the next day.\nHow hard is that? It's hard, especially if you get two nights in a row of no sleep.\nWow. When was the last time you felt really happy? During the holidays, so a couple of weeks ago.\nHow did you feel about the holidays? I felt good. Holidays always try to, you know, Christmas trees and kids and everything. So usually is a good time makes me feel good.\nNice. What are you most proud of in your life? I was married and raising two children and having two kids. I'm very proud of that.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoy. Wow.\nThat's great. Thanks. How did you decide to decide? Well, I went from full-time to part-time work and there's not as much work in the automotive field. So I decided to go back to school.\nEasygoing, fun, easy to get along with. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mom. She's raised four kids single-handedly and was a very hard worker.\nOkay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't give up. Be positive and anything you try to accomplish, Ken, you can do it.\nIs that anything you regret? Not going back to school sooner.\nHave you done anything to avoid it? No, because I was raising two kids by myself. So now that they're grown, I have no excuse. So I'm doing it.\nThat's good. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm friendly. I'm a hard worker and most of the time I'm easy to get along with.\nCan you tell me about that? Like I said, I'm a hard worker. If you give me work to do, I'll do it. Most of the time I'm in a good mood so I'm easy to get along with.\nWhat are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Like I say, bike riding or walks on the beach. The beach is very relaxing.\nThat's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome.\nGoodbye.",
         "For the past two years and two months, I've been dealing with loneliness and depression. It started after I didn't have any family left in the United States. I decided to seek help and went to a counselor and then to group therapy. I really enjoy group therapy because it allows me to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. Sharing our problems and solutions has been helpful. Therapy in general has affected me a lot and has helped me cope with things, and it's nice to have someone to talk to. I didn't want to admit I needed it at first, but I knew I had to do something. Lately, I've been feeling pretty good, more positive. I still go to therapy. Sleep is still a struggle, about 50-50. Some nights are good, others aren't. The holidays always make me feel good, with the Christmas trees and the kids.",

Do we know who she's modeled on? Yes, I'm okay with this. How are you doing today? Very good. That's good. Where are you from originally? LA. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? It's sunny and it's near the ocean. The traffic can make it difficult to drive around between different places. And there's a lack of open spaces if you're not near the beach. No. I haven't finalized any travel plans. Listen to music. Yeah. Why? Well, I tend to excel at things that have to do with spending time alone versus things that have to do with spending time outside with lots of people. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm reasonable. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? Maybe yesterday I was trying to figure out how to pack something into the car. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm very good at it. What do you do when you're in love? I breathe in and out like that. Okay. That's good. What are some things you like to do with time? Like jogging, walking, bicycling, reading, listening to music. Music. Awesome. What did you study at school? Math, engineering, computers. Are you still working on that? A little bit, yeah. What do you do now? I'm a student. I'm going back to school for biological sciences. That's not interesting. How did you decide to do that? I started doing some reading on some textbooks. Okay. What's your dream job? Medical doctor. Really? How hard is that? I guess it depends on what type of medicine you practice. I understand. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I have a mentor. I have a lot of positive thoughts and suggestions. How do you know them? So I met someone through a class and then they worked with them professionally. So it's, I guess you could say through an academic or professional channel. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I can't think of one at the moment. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I don't think so, no. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Okay. I didn't understand any changes in your behavior or thoughts or anything. No. Do you feel down? Sometimes. Can you tell me about that? What do you wanna know? Whatever comes to your mind. Well, I think sometimes I do think about challenges ahead of me. And I can be a little daunting and I feel down. That sounds really hard. It is very hard. How do you cope with that? Go for a walk, read a book, listen to some music. Are they triggered by something? I don't, I mean I'm sure they are. I'm not specifically sure what triggers anything. Maybe feeling overwhelmed or not feeling particularly tied to some task. Is going to a therapist helping you? I don't go to a therapist. Okay. How are your best friends describing you? Reasonably smart, inquisitive and curious. How do you know them? I guess through classes. How close are you to them? Somewhat. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Patience and curiosity. That's good. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. A day ago. No.",

         "Okay. Yes. Very well.\n\nThat's good. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was about. Probably took a year or two. Well, you know, being away from my family, being away from what I was used to in New York, the neighborhoods, the people, and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here.\n\nWell, the weather. Can't beat the weather. It's generally always nice. It's not too hot. It's not too cold. It's creative. I do like movies. I like the beach. The traffic. There's a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here and more distant and unfriendly than other places.\n\nI was a history major.\n\nI do demonstrations in high-end supermarkets.\n\nTo be a screenwriter. That's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. It's hard because I don't always maintain focus and motivation. I let other things distract me.\n\nI've always been interested in films ever since I was a child. I just always was writing and had an active imagination.\n\nIn the last probably almost ten years I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well, I've always traveled, even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So, yes. Seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am. Seeing how they live and taking in the sights. I went to Kenya. That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on. On the safari and just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible. Oh yeah, that's one of the great experiences of my life. I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called Charmel Shake, which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world, which is hard to believe that Egypt would, but it was just amazing. I didn't go scuba diving. I went snorkeling.\n\nWhat do I do to relax? I like to listen to music. I like watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of whatever might be on my mind. I do meditate every day. I like to take walks in nature that's always calming, especially down by the ocean.\n\nIt depends. Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper. A lot of times I'll do a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself, which is something I've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. Also, since I meditate, I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past. Some things that make me really mad. I guess I think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along and make the world better.\n\nWhat was the last thing you argued with someone? Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film and I didn't think it was done very well. We had a fun argument about the movie. That just happened yesterday, so that's on my mind.\n\nIs there anything I regret? Is there anything I regret? Yeah, there have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued them. Certain jobs. When I first got to Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to become a GRIP and I probably should have pursued that.\n\nHow did I decide to do that? I don't really understand the questions. Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important and no matter how you feel, you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do.\n\nNo, but I've been depressed in my life. For the most part, I've been feeling good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. Sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down. I can usually get out of it pretty quickly. Sometimes financial concerns, sometimes an opportunity, how do I explain it? Financial is one way that if I made another decision, I might have more money or my life would be different.\n\nNot really. I feel pretty much the same.\n\nWhat got me to seek help for? Let's come back to that. Generally, talking to someone has helped when I did do that.\n\nPretty easy. I don't have problems sleeping. Usually I'm grumpy. If I don't sleep well, I feel tired and irritable.\n\nHow would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier.\n\nI think it's tough, it depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write, so that means that I have to spend time alone. When I come out of that, I'm extroverted. I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood.\n\nMy best qualities. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likeable personality. People have said that. I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's a cool detachment. I'm creative, intuitive.\n\nYes. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy. I had breakfast, I was happy. Sun was shining.\n\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I do remember snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun, the powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond, almost beyond like human in a way. Just more in touch with everything, the universe. It would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day, but...\n\nWhat am I most proud of in my life? I think I've helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, I've written some screenplays, I've had some good relationships. Good relationships, just being connected with someone else, spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels.\n\nIt could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something. If I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive, it puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye bye.\n\nSometimes she would ask me, it would sort of tweak, and then it would ask me this question about not being able to do it. I don't remember it really getting specific like that. Oh, like what? Do you remember what question you're talking about? It kind of asks me, well, are you depressed? Sometimes. It will explain that, and then it was like, well... Then it did something, and then it was like, well... Did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, we... There was no bridge to that conversation. Got it, got it.",
         "Okay, so, I have experienced depression in my life, though for the most part, I feel good. I do sometimes feel a little blue, especially if I let regrets creep into my mind, like missed opportunities. I can usually pull myself out of it pretty quickly, though. Financial worries can also get me down, making me think about how different my life might be if I'd made different choices. Talking to someone has been helpful in the past when I felt down. My friends probably wish I was a little happier and more accomplished in achieving my goals.",

About 16, 12 years ago, something like that. That's a long time. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It was pretty hard, you know, different environment. I had to learn different things, so. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather, there's a lot to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Too many people. Okay.

Knowing that how evil the world is, and your son has to live in it. How hard is that? It used to be hard, but with prayer and faith, everything's gonna be all right. That's good. When do you think it's gonna get good? They're very fast. Tell me more about that. When we were growing up, things was different, you know, but now the world is just way worse off than what it is, than what it was. What's one of your most memorable experience? Flying in the airplane for the first time. Cool. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I was nervous, because I've never been on a plane before, so. How did you feel in that moment? Felt a little nervous, scared, you can say. I'd love to hear about when you're trip. Yeah, this one, I flew back home, you know, visited home, went back for about a week or two, seen my family, hadn't seen them in a couple of years, so that was pretty cool. Okay. What do you study at school? Right now, college, I'm studying, I want to be a culinary arts, so I want to be a chef. Awesome. How did you decide to do that?

I'm proud that I made a decision to serve the Lord and do the right things. Last night. Just because it's like I know that everything's gonna be all right, and I have no more worries, so I'm happy. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Cooking. Cooking puts me in a good mood and seeing that my kids are happy, that's cool. Is there anyone you regret? I'm not gonna regret it. Nope, can't say I regret anything. I really don't know. No prob, bye-bye. I feel like someone's really asking me questions.",
         "I have not been diagnosed with depression, but I can say that my life wasn't always the way it should be. Lately, I've been feeling a whole lot better because I gave my life to the Lord and started going to church. I knew I needed to make a change, and I'm trying to do the right things now. Making this decision has made me feel like everything's going to be alright, and I have no more worries.",

         "Okay, thank you.\nI'm Ellie, thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions and get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this?\nSure.\nOkay, so how are you doing today?\nI'm doing fine, just a little tired.\nWhere are you from originally?\nCalifornia.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nUm, the weather.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nFear of earthquakes.\nI see what you mean. What did you study at school?\nPsychology.\nCool, are you still working on that?\nI am, I go to Harbor College.\nAre you happy you did that?\nI am. I wish I would have went sooner, but better late than never.\nYeah, what's your dream job?\nProbably I'm not sure, I never really thought about it. I want to work in the field of psychology. But I'm not sure if I want to work with children or adults. So I haven't really decided.\nOkay, do you travel a lot?\nNo.\nWhy?\nI don't know. I just don't. Maybe once a year.\nWhen was the last time you traveled?\nJune actually, I went to Orlando, Florida.\nAwesome, do you consider yourself an introvert?\nSometimes.\nBut not as relaxed I'm sorry What do you do to relax?\nWatch TV, read a book, talk on the phone.\nWhat are some things that make you really mad?\nMad?\nMy mom gets in my business. Other than that, I guess just frustrations with my son.\nDo you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo.\nWhat's the hardest thing about being a parent?\nThe hardest thing is raising a child with a disability. Not knowing how you can help him.\nThat sounds really hard.\nIt is, it's very hard. I don't sugarcoat it at all.\nWhat's the best thing about being a parent?\nJust having my children, they're a blessing, I love them. With all the good and the bad, it's a part of me. I just love the fact that I'm helping mold them into good human beings.\nHow close are you to your family?\nWe're really close. My family's small, we live within blocks of each other. But yeah, we're close.\nOkay What's one of your most memorable experiences? Good or bad. What comes to your mind?\nMost memorable? Just giving birth for the first time. It was just amazing. My son is nine now, so I still remember it like it was yesterday.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nLike I was being born again myself. I don't know how to explain it. It's just very emotional.\nOkay Is there anything you regret?\nI don't know. I guess I have a lot of regrets. But none that I really want to mention. I guess I understand.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nStay in school. Don't get emotionally involved. And let people deter you from your goals.\nHave you done anything to avoid it?\nOh yeah, definitely.\nDid you want me to... I'm okay I'm okay, I mean, I'm pretty easy going. For the most part I don't really have a temper per se. Things frustrate me more than they anger me.\nWhat's the last thing you argue with someone?\nOh, that's easy. With my mother, she's like I guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to socialize. She feels that I'm married with children. So I should stay at home like 99% of the time. And I wanted to go out and socialize with some ex-co-workers. And she basically kind of put me down for it. As if I don't spend enough time with my children. It does. And I love my mom. I hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her. Because I always think, gosh, I don't want to get mad at her. And then something happens to her the next day. But she gets kind of intrusive, I don't know.\nWhen was the last time you felt really happy?\nOh, I know. After the semester ended when I noted that I did well in school. Because it had been a long time since I went to school. So when I received my grades, A and a B, I was like, wow, okay I can do this. And it made me happy. And that was about a few weeks ago, I guess.\nThat's great.\nThank you.\nThere's some of it that's been impossible to do. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life.\nMy mom, I know, it's good and bad. I mean, for the most part, my mom's been a positive influence. You know, it's just sometimes, you know, she gets a little Like she wants to re-raise me or something Like she doesn't understand that I'm an adult I'm going to make my own decisions now. Pretty much have to let me do what I need to do. A lot of heavy breathing I mean, I walk sometimes when I get a little frustrated Whatever, I'll just go take a walk You know, or just try not to think about it.\nThank you.\nYes.\nYes, the Navy.\nI was 19.\nYeah, yes.\nI didn't have any other options.\nI am, I probably should have stayed in a little longer. I was only in for four years, but You know, I wanted to experience life outside the military So I did my enlistment and then I got out. It made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that You know, did not join the military. I could notice a big difference as far as, you know, how I lived my life and how they lived theirs. Just made me a little bit more responsible.\nThank you.\nI worked in the medical field for about five years.\nAnd, oh, thank you. But it wasn't for me, I wanted to do something a little bit different. I didn't want to do patient care. I wanted to work with people, but not necessarily as a patient care provider. So I started going to school and then I met my husband. I stopped going to school. Got married and I started working in the telecommunications field. And then we, you know, conceived our child and after that You know That's it.\nI think I'm caring, well, I know I am, I'm very caring. You know, I'm very honest to a fault sometimes. You know, I try to be as honest as possible with people. Sometimes it can hurt their feelings, but You know, you gotta be honest. You can't let people think that, you know, you're not trusting. And if Yeah, probably, I never really thought about it. I don't know. Maybe, I don't really think about it. I just try to be the best person that I can be. You know, so That's all I can do, I can't live for what other people think. I can only do what I need to do.\nI don't know. I never really thought about it. I guess it's just, you know, being around my kids. You know, I just love being around my children. That always puts me in a good mood.\nThank you.\nOkay, like I said, a little tired, you know, but You know, for the most part, okay. You know, dealing with situations different Well, I go to bed really early, so As long as I go to bed early, I get a good night's sleep. But I wake up early as well, so It's kind of like Get in bed a little bit, I go to bed at like 8, 8.30 And then I wake up at like 1, 1.30 So Very moody Very irritable, short tempered, I guess. If you're a little bit more sensitive If anything, I think I'm thinking more positively You know, like I said, especially with my son having a disability You know, I look at it as if You know, it's not all bad I mean, he has challenges But I'm dealing with them a lot better You know, as opposed to feeling sorry for him Or feeling sorry for myself You know, I'm just finding more avenues to work with him You know, different resources to help him As opposed to just feeling guilty or sad or depressed about it.\nThank you.\nNo.\nOccasionally.\nWho does it?\nWhat color is your best friend?\nI don't know, can we skip that question?\nWhat color is your best friend?\nGreen. Seems to be the word, kind of like Yeah, probably green, like Naive a little. But at the same time, smart. I think she'll describe me as smart.\nThank you.\nOkay.\nNo problem.\nBye.\nOh, I'm sorry, I gotta push the button. It was fine, I kind of skipped one question though.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nI wouldn't say I'm currently depressed, but I have dealt with feeling guilty, sad, or depressed about my son's disability in the past. Now, I'm actively trying to think more positively and find resources to help him instead of dwelling on negative emotions. I also get very moody, irritable, and short-tempered when I don't get enough sleep. I go to bed early, around 8 or 8:30 PM, but I also wake up very early, around 1 or 1:30 AM.",

         "Okay. From here from Alhambra. The weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. What are some things you don't really like about the weather? Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Is that amazing? How did you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? Yes. What are you doing now? I'm a photographer. Nice. What's your dream job? Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. Okay. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. I see. How do you like your living situation? It's fair. It's not the greatest. Because of being an apartment manager, I do have free rent, but I have to stay there a lot. That's tough. That part does. The free rent part is very good. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Oh gosh. My most memorable experience. That's hard to say. Well, I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. What else do you like? Oh, well I guess some sports success when I was in high school. There were a few things that I was happy about. And some art pieces I've made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death. Those are very memorable and not good though. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters. So my family. How close are you to your family? We're fairly close. Most of them live around in LA. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. Wow. When do you think of the music? Mostly very talented. Just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. Seems like they were all hooked into social media. What do you do to relax? I go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. And I... Well, there's some kind of injustices that happen. Not big deals, but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend. And when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it. And we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set up time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up. When they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that part is upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up at the office. They just need to please the school to maintain the account. So often when that something like that happens, it means they will not send you out to work at that school again, which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. That's how they do things. So that is upsetting. How do you cope with that? Most of the time I dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that might be better. That's good. Yeah. How are you at controlling your company? Pretty good. I usually might, in the moment I don't really lose it, but later I might vent or something like that. But on the location I wouldn't do that. When was the last time you argued with someone? Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. I have a friend that I'm sharing the car with today. We were arguing on where to go first. So we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And then after this was one of the things is over, then we're going to do some more of her things. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Is that what that is? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I'd say 1980. Yeah, I believe it was 1980. What got you to see the doctor? My father noticed some symptoms. My father passed away, but he was a psychiatrist. What were your symptoms? Well, I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon. And I didn't have a focus like for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all part of depression. Yeah. Isn't it that you had a problem before you found out? Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? Well, I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done. But I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. What sort of changes have you noticed since you came on the field? I think therapy makes you see what the... I thought of it as a filter or wearing a... As if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really... You see everything through that. So you have to... I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately? Or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. How have you been doing lately? I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I've noticed in my past. Right now we have a work slowdown. So it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule is too wide open. For me personally as a depressed person, I think that structure is really important. It gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere on time and interact with people. Those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed. I think I've noticed any changes in your behavior. Well, I don't know if it changes a little bit. I tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting let's say. But it's more negative. I have been thinking about how soldiers in the past, I don't know why, but during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been like to be in a front line battle with crude weapons and no medical help. I don't know. My mind seems to go there a lot where I'm just thinking about that. I've been looking at and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube and things like that. Or some other kind of like terrible doom type things like I was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that. Where I probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. Oh, you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not finishing college. I think I was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well. I didn't get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years. So that's a big regret that I have. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I think it would have been to, at certain points, I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals, just the logistics. I was an art major and I had no car. So a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and also to meet at away locations. I think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time. What would you say as somebody who has holidays? Well, I've been told I'm very patient and also I have some original artistic ideas. So those are good qualities. I'm very loyal and also I support my friends. I'm fairly generous with them. Tell me about something you really enjoyed. Let's see. Let's see, I really enjoyed it. I had a nice experience just photographing a soccer game recently. I really enjoyed that. I love listening to you talk. Okay, I think I've answered everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. It's my pleasure. Thank you, goodbye. Yeah, that was very interesting. So I'm going to go to the top and then if you want to go back to the other computer.",

         "Okay. So now I'm going to start the virtual human app and I'll hand you the doorbell when you're done. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in the same sense of their environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'd like to get your questions started. And please feel free to comment anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with that? Yes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay.\nWhy did you move to LA? This was 30 years ago. My cousin went out here and said, I might as well go. Nothing happening here in Jersey City. I got to come out. That was in 19...\nHow was it to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Just like you find your nine-to-five job to pay the rent and a lot of things to do here.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? Probably the film industry and the celebrities and the glamour and excitement. I fit in real good.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, just like probably the homeless problem. You've got to see the derelicts and they eat out of the garbage. We're the homeless capital of America. You've got to see this all over the place. Yeah. I see what you mean.\nWhen did you study at school? I just graduated high school, but I have an interest in writing.\nWhat made you decide to do that? I have an interest in reading and words and creating stories and being imaginative. I haven't written anything in a while. That's my drug. I don't drink or smoke or do any kind of drugs, but writing was always what got me high. That's good. Yeah. But I haven't been inspired. I recently just met a young girl who's a stand-up. Her routine is so interesting. I could write a novel of her routine.\nTell me about that. Oh. I don't know. Actually, Facebook, she told us all this stuff about how she's friends with a homeless woman and a homeless woman can inherit $4 million if she gets off the street. And she has an autistic sister who's very strange, but is crazy about guys. And she's like 20 and wants to be a comic, and she's really talented. I've been Facebooking her, but she hasn't responded.\nOkay. You can believe it's all an introvert? Yes.\nWhy? What does introvert mean? Well, do I keep everything inside of me? Probably. And I'm always thinking probably all the time. Thinking about my problems and just too much analyzing. Yeah.\nWhat are some things that would be really nice? Probably lazy people, people just living off the government and going to get their Section 8. They just don't go out and just work and fend for themselves and take care of themselves. Just people who are so lazy. And some that go, they walk around, they're in the traffic with their signs, give me money, please help me, please help me. Help yourself. Help me, help me. That's what makes me mad.\nWhat do you do when you're annoyed? I try to just deal with it. Because I don't like being annoyed or angry. I don't really curse that much. I try to just stay calm, intelligent. So I just try to deal with it and suppress it and work through it.\nHow are you at controlling your anger? I'm okay. But lately I have had outbursts and I regret it. Only probably due to lack of sleep or just the tension that's rising and problems going on. But I try to just stay calm.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? And what were you about? Oh, oh wow. I don't like to argue, but I was arguing with a girl who was working at a movie theater and she was giving people wrong directions on which line to stand on. And she was causing like hassles. And I was saying, you know, they have to stand over here and don't send them over there. They won't get into the film screening. And there was some argument going on. And of course I was in the right. She was giving wrong information. This was at Grumman's Chinese Theater.\nOkay. How close are you to your family? Well, I do have a twin brother that I live with, but we don't get along with total opposites. I have a sister I haven't seen or talked to probably in 18 years. I have a younger brother. Don't see him much. And what's sad, I just have a mother who's still around. She's like 70, 75. Probably in the last three years, there's no communication, no phone calls, no Facebooking. Just separated. It's like we don't interest each other.\nWhy? Just the way that she's always, I don't know. I never had a father. The father left when I was four. She's always been a housewife. She's always been on welfare and food to dams. I just never really worked. I just wish she did something more. I do love her. We don't have a relationship anymore. I understand.\nThere's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Who's been a positive influence? Probably good writers. Probably some of my favorite authors who inspire me to write better.\nCan you speak to that? I don't know. I like the writer like William Goldman. He's a very good writer. He wrote Marathon Man and he writes about how to write screenplays. He wrote The Princess Bride. He's been an inspiration.\nNice. What do you think is the new kid? What was that? What do you think of today's kids? Today's kids? Oh, I can answer that with three words. Two aspects. There's just too much video games, too much technology, too much skateboarding. In the 70s when I grew up, we were locked in rooms or sitting in front of screens for hours and hours and hours. This is 2013. Life is hard for everybody and everyone's just trying to get through it. It's tough.\nHow would your best friend describe you? Generous and funny and fun to be with. Just an all-around great guy.\nHave you ever served in the military? No.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Yes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed? Six years ago.\nWhat got you into health? I probably went to a free clinic. Things were bad. I was probably interested in medication. Then when they offered it to me, I decided not to deal with it. I don't want to take medication or anything. I was taking Lipitor for high cholesterol and getting too much side effects, fatigue and sleeplessness and dizziness. I won't take medication.\nDid you think you had a problem before you found out? I'm a creative person. I've just suffered depression probably all my life. I have my highs and my lows. Just feeling blah. Walking around and just not feeling anything. Not feeling good about anything or excited about anything. Bored. So bored all the time.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Lately, I've never felt so bad in my entire life. Probably the last few years have just been really bad. I'm in survival mode. I'm sorry you're doing that. It's pretty bad.\nHave you noticed any change in your living here in the country? Change. I've just become a boring person. I go to all these free events all the time trying to save money. I'm out every night. I'm rarely at my home. I'm out all the time. Going to events, having a good time then. But it's like I'm just trying to shut out life. I live in movie theaters just trying to just block everything out. That's not good.\nDo you still go to therapy now? No.\nWhy don't you stop? I wasn't really into therapy. He was a Korean guy who said, yeah, you're depressed. You have suffered depression. I may be bipolar, but I'll deal with it.\nHow easy is it sleeping in a good night's sleep? Believe it or not, if it's just dark and quiet, I'll sleep pretty good. Eight to ten hours. Sometimes, because I snore, sometimes I'm not allowed to sleep. Sometimes I get kicked out of the apartment. It's a small apartment. I've slept on alleyways. I've slept in doorways just to experience it. I'm not homeless. That's when I can't sleep. That's when I get two or three hours. There's your answer. Inside, I can sleep okay. Because I'm always fatigued. I'm very tired, and I'm a heavy snorer. I snore like a chainsaw. They have it.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? Whew. I'm okay. People can tell. I'm just drowsy. Probably irritable. I just want to let darkness come. Let me just get at least four, five, six. Some sleep at all, please. If I get some, then I'll be okay.\nOkay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I had a gambling addiction. I messed my whole life up. I pretty much lost everything. When was the last time I was happy? I probably took $60 to a casino. Turned it into $1,200. I had $1,200 in my pocket. It was exciting. Of course, the next few days, $1,200 was liquidated. It went because I was stupid and got greedy. That's when I'm happiest. Go to a casino and win or just stay even and not lose anything. That's where my adrenaline is.\nHas that gotten you in trouble? Yes, it has. It put me where I am today. Too much blackjack. It's bad. Otherwise, in the past three years, I've had... No, not much. The gambling is not worth it. In the end, you lose everything. Yeah. Apology accepted.\nWhat would you say of somebody who has followed you? I am generous. I'm a nice guy. I'm not going to do you wrong. I'm very reliable. All-around good guy. I'll help you out. I'll lend you a few dollars. I think I'm all right.\nNothing in your debt? No, nothing at all.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I just hope that there is a second chapter in my life at my age. Right now, I'm just floundering, killing time. It's probably been four years now of nothingness.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Manage your money better. I would never think I would have six figures in the bank, but I did. It evaporated very slowly. The advice is probably just don't gamble. Keep your money. Try to find some other means of excitement. For me, being at that blackjack table with big wages was my reality. That reality was better than being outside the casino. My reality was right there. At Texas Hold'em, I did okay. I didn't lose much. I'm a pretty good player. Blackjack, it just took everything.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life? That I had those 12 years. I owned a casting company for 12 years. I provided people for movies and television shows. A lot of audience work. I made a lot of money for 12 years and traveled. I had the time of my life. At least on my deathbed, I can say from 1996 to 2008, I had a lot of money. I had 12 years that I never thought I would ever have. Money, money.\nWhat is something you really enjoyed? That I really enjoyed. My excitement is getting into a big movie premiere at the Gromit. You know, you get the tree and you get the popcorn and soda and you see the stars. That's about as exciting as it's going to get right now.\nAwesome. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Alright. Take care. Bye.",
         "I was diagnosed with depression about six years ago, but I think I've suffered from it my whole life. I'm a creative person, and I've always had my highs and lows, just feeling \"blah\" and bored. Lately, though, it's been worse than ever. I'm just in survival mode. I went to a free clinic and they offered medication, but I didn't want to take it. I don't like medication. I wasn't really into therapy either. The therapist just confirmed I was depressed and maybe bipolar, but I figured I'd just deal with it. To cope, I go to free events every night to shut out life, spending time in movie theaters to block everything out.",

         "Okay, great. So everything's all set up now. Sorry about that. No, it's okay. So if you just want to give me one second, I'll be right back. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Something's bound to happen, right? Of course. Let's start this again. So we'll just keep going. So I'm going to do something for our purposes. It's kind of spooky. All right. So whenever she's done, she'll let you know, and then you can press this button. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm here to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people's lives. And I'm going to be making a video about this. Okay. So I'm going to start the video. I'm here to learn about people, and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you two questions to get started. And please feel free to comment at me. Your answers are very confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So how are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I am from Los Angeles. I see. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? It's the center of everything. You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, being in LA also you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But you know, you live with that. I see. What did you study at school? I was a business administration major, so I studied business. And after I finished college, I pursued a career in retail operations. Are you still doing that? No, as a matter of fact, I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years. So I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. What made you decide to do that? A couple of factors. After working numerous years in the retail business, I switched over and worked in a creative business, which was a graphic design firm. And I captured a lot of knowledge in the human resources side because I was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a small company. Are you happy you did that? Yes, I'm very happy I did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it's very helpful. That's great. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? Well, my dream job is I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am an independent contractor. I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs. And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle, but I also enjoy what I do. I'm not under as much stress as I used to be. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not totally outgoing, but I'm not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle, maybe more towards outgoing, but I'm not totally outgoing. I mean, when I'm around other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself. Can you tell me about that? Oh sure. A couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had bypass operation and it had to do with stress and things like that. I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If I meet someone new I don't just openly say, well you know, I've experienced this, this, and this. I just basically, if it comes up I won't deny it, or if it comes up and I feel like it's something to talk about, I will talk about it. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom, my mother, and she's a senior citizen, she's alone. So what I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that. That's actually very therapeutic. How are you at controlling your hunger? I'm not a short-fuse kind of person. It takes a lot to get me really angry. So as far as my temper is concerned, there's not much to that. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? That sucks. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I had a slight chance it was going to help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point, or it would kill him. And that was really tough. It was a really tough decision to make. That sounds really hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My mother is a very good friend of mine. She has her issues, I have my issues, but we are not divorced. We were just separated. We still have a relationship where we still speak to each other. We just don't live together. And the relationship with my mother is really great. She's very understanding. She's 82 years old, so she likes having me around, which is good because she's in her later stage of her life. I guess it's good that in its own way, maybe fate has taken place because someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing. She feels comfortable with me there. I think there's a comfort level she feels with me there, especially being her only child. What's something you feel guilty about? Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things that I did to hurt my marriage. The things that I did, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah, I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had. We were growing apart. When she was away, my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. I spent a lot of time in the casinos. What eventually happened was I spent a lot of money. Obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship. It had to do with trust because it was devastating to my wife. How did you feel at that moment? When it came to light, I felt very guilty and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. I'm sorry. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not at all. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, not really. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping, so no. That's good. Do you feel down? No, not at all. Have you ever studied using an indicator of your health? No. The only thing I can say is after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. I tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that. That's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy? Probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I guess the number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight. In general, just be more healthier physically. As far as mentally, just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish. How do you cope with that? Just one day at a time. I try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch TV. I do things that I know that if I can help myself, I do things to help myself. Is there anything you regret? There's a lot that I regret, obviously. My marriage, my working career. I had a long career with this major food chain. Basically, because of my gambling issues, I ended up ruining a very good career. At this point right now, there's not much I can do. I can't change what's been done, so I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me every day. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself. Make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent, but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things, but deep down, I don't think as a person, I'm a bad person. I remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had an illness, a compulsive, obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill. That I was a sick person just trying to become healthy. Every day, that's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night, one day at a time. How hard is that? It's not as hard as you think, but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you. It could be okay for other people to do certain things, but I cannot do those things anymore. How would your best friend describe you? Most of my best friends describe me as probably easygoing, generous, a nice person to be around. They were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage, which is still not over yet. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning, around six o'clock. I go to a local park. This park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles, and I take a brisk walk in the morning, get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. Then after that, I go home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax, and then just kick back for the rest of the day. Then the next day, I do the same thing again. In the morning, I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch TV, whatever. Just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. Nice. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Okay. Lock yourself out. Okay. I actually got comfortable talking to you. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, that's pretty cool.",
         "Okay, here's my experience with depression. While I haven't been formally diagnosed with depression, I've definitely had struggles that have impacted my mental well-being. A few years ago, I had a heart attack related to stress. Looking back, I recognize that my compulsive gambling was a major issue. It stemmed from working long hours under a lot of stress and it became a way to cope. It led to significant financial problems and a breakdown of trust with my wife, ultimately contributing to the end of my marriage. I felt immense guilt and like less than a human being when the extent of my gambling came to light. I wouldn't say I feel \"down\" now, but I do have regrets about the pain I caused and the career I ruined. Now I focus on taking things one day at a time, trying to be at peace, meditating, and doing things that help me stay healthy and avoid those past behaviors. I think of it as a recovery process.",

         "Okay, great.\n\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nSo, how are you doing today?\nI'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay.\nWhere are you from originally?\nI was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast.\nWhy did you move to LA?\nOriginally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again.\nHow easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?\nIt's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nNot at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends. I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nDepends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy.\nOkay.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed.\nWhen was the last time that happened?\nA few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nI've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to really hit me.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nGood. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nLast night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about?\nA lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really wanted to work and I ended up and it was partly due to I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty tough.\nCan you have done anything to avoid it?\nWell some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have been it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were.\nI think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself.\nI mean it's possible. I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah.\nThat sounds really hard.\nWell it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by drinking and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's been better.\nThat's good. How do you cope with them?\nWell like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet.\nAre they triggered by something?\nThey're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to this. It's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nI'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep. I don't know. I get up, I toss and turn all night. You know and now it's yeah I don't sleep too great right now.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well?\nIt's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad.\nOkay. How long ago were you diagnosed?\nI think three, three, four years ago. It was when I had been given taken stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So yeah that was kind of a turning point. But unfortunately it happened after everything went bad.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nLooking back on it I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain and I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean I was paying a lot of money to go see doctors and they were doing they it didn't help it didn't work until I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little late now\nWhat got you to say help?\nThere really wasn't any choice I had to. I was a mess. It was either I was self-medicating or I was affecting my work everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I just had to make this different but again it was too late because then my review came up a few months later and after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. But it was at least that and not firing me. But so I got help but it wasn't soon enough. Not as much as I should.\nI go to a couple of meetings so that I can keep control of that aspect and there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately being unemployed my employment ran out I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. Somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. And then there's you.\nRight.\nJust saying stuff out loud is like getting the stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of drugs you're taking all that stuff that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can do. Something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing.\nIt's sort of it has its ups and downs. You know I'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a day and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to being self sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just I have to deal with real life which is It has its own challenge.\nYeah.\nIt can be tough to find a good job.\nYeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nIt was probably a couple of years ago. The thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job. I was making these great videos with this person that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree. And we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger bigger life that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and everything was going really well. I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So.\nWhat are you most proud of?\nProbably the educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about the world around them so that I feel like that was a really good thing to do. It was part of my job. It was an interesting life. We were trying to come up with new ideas for because we would put together videos and stuff to give to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of and so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it.\nOkay.\nI think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.\nThank you. Howdy. Bye.",
         "Okay, here’s a summary of my experiences with depression, from my perspective:\n\nI've been dealing with depression for a few years, though I was initially treated only for anxiety. Looking back, I'm angry because I feel like I lost everything – my job, relationships, my old life – due to a chemical imbalance in my brain that wasn't properly addressed. I sought help and saw doctors, but it wasn’t effective until I found a psychiatrist who correctly diagnosed me and prescribed the right medication.\n\nBefore that, things spiraled out of control, especially in a past relationship that I feel guilty about because I wasn’t medicated properly. Now, the medication helps me manage things. I still get upset and depressed, but I don’t completely lose it for days like I used to.\n\nI still struggle with dwelling on things, even things from high school. I used to self-medicate with alcohol to slow my mind down, but the medication has helped. I cope by constantly occupying my mind – watching TV while playing games, or using the computer while watching a show. My thoughts are triggered by everything, and it feels like I never get a break. I'm also a light sleeper, which doesn’t help.\n\nCurrently, I attend meetings for support and have access to a psychiatrist through the city, but only see her a few times a year to keep my medication coming. Talking about my feelings, even to a program like this, helps me process and externalize the mess in my head. The chemical parts of my depression are getting under control, but now I'm facing real-world challenges like unemployment and struggling to become self-sufficient again. I remember a time a few years ago when everything was going well, and I felt like a normal, happy person. I don't know if I'll ever feel that way again.",

         "That's true. Research shows that that's really beneficial. All right. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and stay and secure in my room. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you OK with this? Yeah, I'm OK with it. OK. So, how are you doing today? Um, I'm OK. I guess. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from LA. I'm basically an LA kind of guy. Cool. What are some things you really like about LA? Um, you know, the weather. It's usually pretty sunny and temporary. I like the climate really a lot. I like the girls here. I don't like the traffic, but I like the city. I like the Hispanic population quite a bit. And I have a lot of friends here, so I guess I don't want to be anywhere else. Uh-huh. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Like I said, the traffic. I was on the 405. That's always kind of crummy. The cost of living, that's really terrible about LA. It's always expensive. And it just seems like LA is one of those places where you either have a ton of money and fame and fortune or you're down in the ghettos. Yeah. Do you travel a lot? I have. I've been to a couple of places, but very brief, mostly for school. I went to Arizona and New York and Montana, a lot of anthropology and archaeology, field trips and things like that. Nothing I'm doing right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like getting away from the city. I was in Yosemite last year in the summer for vacation. That was kind of nice. Yosemite was really neat to see. But just basically getting away from the city, getting away from the job, getting away from the stress here. Yeah. What did you study at school? I actually studied political science and I also studied economics. I'm a big kind of political junkie, so I naturally kind of fell in line with that kind of field of study. Are you still working on that? I was, but I lost my job. And that's kind of a bummer. I lost it maybe a year and a half from now, maybe two years. The economy got bad, and the budget cuts got bad, and I wish I was working there again. Yeah. What's your dream job? Well, I wanted to be a lawyer at one time. I wanted to be a lawyer, and that's why I took political science, and I took a double major in economics. And the sad thing I regret is to get into law school, you have to take this entrance exam called the LSATs. And I studied really hardcore for about a year. And I took the CAD test, and like an idiot, I didn't feel right about that day. It was kind of an off day. And it was like the big game at the Super Bowl. I just don't feel like I did well. And I canceled the test, and so I kind of regret that. That sucks. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not really shy at all. I'm definitely not shy. But outgoing, I'm not flamboyant. I talk to people. I don't mind talking to people. I don't mind meeting people. That's fine with me, but it's not like I'm dying to meet anybody. Yeah. What do you do to relax? These days, I play guitar. I taught myself how to play guitar. I should actually be doing more of it. But I also like to exercise. I'm on a diet right now, but my diet's been terrible. Eating habits have been terrible. But the exercise part is just great. I love to exercise. I love to run. That's one of my best things to do for stress is run and work out. I just wish that my eating habits were a little bit better. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? My temper could be definitely improved a lot. A lot of times I feel I'm one of these introvert type persons. When it comes to I don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and having a good time, whatever. When I'm mad, I really don't want to be talking to people. I don't like to yell. I don't like to scream. I don't like to hit. I don't like to fight. I kind of close down a lot. I just want to be left alone. Sometimes I tend to drag it on for longer than it should be. The wife doesn't like it too much. Maybe I just don't want to talk about it. I just don't want to deal with it. I kind of close down and shut off for a little bit. Geez. It doesn't happen too often. Maybe with my wife, probably something silly. Who knows? Can you give me an example of that? Let's see. I guess sometimes I'm a married guy, but sometimes there are times I like to smile at a girl or get a girl's attention. I don't know. I never do anything about it. I never get the phone number or sometimes I like to talk to people, I guess. Well, that's a good question. I guess I always handle it the same. I don't ever wish to ever change it. I never want to handle things differently. I'm pretty comfortable the way I handle things. I think that it could be a lot worse than shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that, and that's just not me. I think the best thing to do is kind of get a lot of breathing room, a lot of space, and I don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently. I just don't basically know what else to do. And the last thing I want to do is start talking about feelings or any of this. That's the last thing I want to do. So I don't wish that I handle things like that differently in that way. Well, you know, I'm pretty happy with my family right now. I'm married and we have a baby along the way, which is kind of nice. We have some cats and a dog, a weenie dog. And my mom, I love my mom dearly. She has diabetes, which she doesn't control. She doesn't control it and it affects her health. It always has me worried about her and stressing out about her. She could do so much to prevent it and she doesn't. I have a good relationship with my mom. I love her dearly. And I actually have good relations with everybody, I think. I think I have a ton of family and friends that get along with me pretty well, actually. Yeah. There are times when it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep. Actually, I feel like I sleep like a baby. The only problem I have, I think, is I feel like sometimes you fall asleep and you have you're just going to sleep and you kind of like joke, you almost kind of like fall. It's like a falling sensation or something like that. It doesn't happen that often, but it happens. For the most part, I sleep like a rock. I sleep really good. That's good. What have you been feeling lately? Well, right now, generally, I've been feeling worried and anxious and tense. The reason why is because I said my mom, at least today, I found out my mom, she didn't tell me the whole story and I'm kind of waiting until this is over so I can find out what's wrong with her. I'm worried about her. She's in the doctors right now, so that doesn't tell me anything good. I'm trying to find a job. So that has me worried too. The baby along the way. So that has me worried. I feel overwhelmed with a lot of things to do and a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me, but I have to handle it. Yeah. How do you cope with them? Well, I keep myself distracted. I keep myself busy. I feel like a busy body, and the more which kind of seems like it's not a good thing because I feel like I'm just adding more things on my plate. One of the things I do is exercise. I have to work out every day, but that takes an hour to change and start running and go through the whole thing of stretching and cooling down. It takes some time and then to shower and all that kind of stuff takes time. I have to do it daily. So I cope with it in that way. I also cope with it playing guitar. That's just more of a distraction. Keeping busy that way. It just seems like it's not working towards the goals that I need to do is find a job, which I should be doing. It's one of those things where I find there's no good jobs. I've been looking and looking and sometimes when I do, it's just not what I want to do. It just doesn't seem like I want to do these terrible jobs. It's probably harder than I'm thinking about it because sometimes I feel like it is hard, but it's not. There are ways I can cope with it. I just got to kind of accepted it a lot, internalized it. It's not something that's I'm not out on the streets or anything like that. It is a worry. I've never been diagnosed with PTSD. The last time I was really happy, I feel like nothing makes me happy no more. I learned a new song on the guitar. I feel like not even happy about that. I work out. Sometimes that kind of makes me happy. Running like fast and working out. That doesn't make me so excited or anything like that. It just makes me feel good. I have these times where I'm feeling good about myself, but I'm never feeling great. I'm never feeling happy. I'm never feeling sensationalized. These are old times where there's a few good times and a few bad times, but the good times are never extremes, never really good times and never really atrocious bad times. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I wish this diet would work out a little bit better because I'm the kind of guy who just likes rice and Mexican food and snacks. I feel like that I could change. I wish I could change my eating habits that way. I can because I work out so much. I feel like I do so much running and so much activity that if I got my diet in check, that would go a long way. I wish I also can change my desire to get ahead right now. I feel just so like the economy is so bad and things are so rough that it's pointless to even look for these kind of jobs. I just wish I had a little bit more inspiration and a lot more motivation to do things. Is there anything you regret? The one thing I regret is this LSAT thing, not canceling the test to begin with, because I'm sure I could have gone into school. But then again, it has me thinking, do I really want to pay a bunch of law school tuition and the cost of that just to be powered down with more work and things like that? There is this idea of justice and republicanism and things that I really adhere to that I fall in love with that I don't want to get away from. It just seems like it's a ton of work and money just for the small percentage of success that you might not be able to do in that kind of field. It just doesn't seem like it's worth overcoming the obstacles I need to overcome. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I have no idea. 20 years ago. I would tell myself maybe I think I've done everything really well for myself, except for the LSAT thing, which I regret on one hand and the other hand, I'm not sure if I regret because of the bills and all that kind of stuff. I've waited to get married. I waited to have a kid. I've been pretty cautious about this. I don't take drugs. I don't drink. I don't fight. I don't do any of these things that I think that real people have and they really ruin their life. I'm pretty happy and content with being cautious. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? Oh, my best friend. I think he kind of likes me. He wishes that I would do more things with him, but he works at night. I think most people, not just my best friend, but my wife and my rest of my family feel that I don't put a lot of time and attention to them. I mean, they think that I'm pretty great when I do give them my time of day and my attention. I don't know if I'm really there all the time. I don't know if I'm really, I'm always thinking about something else. I'm always thinking about something different. I don't know if I really can give them a real shoulder to cry on or if they ask for something, I'll usually do it, but I almost feel like it's like a chore. If they really need me, then I'll do it. If they're just asking for a favor, I almost feel I do it with a lot of lackluster, a lot of half-hardness. It's not because I hate them or anything. I really like them. It's just that I feel like I almost I don't want to say I owe it to them, but the mere fact that I'm their friend makes them somehow like it makes me, they rely on me. In times like I don't want to let them down. They are my friends, but at the same time, I just feel like it's more of like a chore to do instead of a willingness. It's just something that I do because I kind of have to. You got to do things for your friends in the end because they're your friends. In the end I do like them and they probably would do it for me. So I just do these things. Well, there are a couple of things that I do like that I feel good about myself. I ran the LA marathon. That kind of feels good. I graduated from college. That kind of feels good. The thing is, I don't feel like that proud of myself for those things alone. Graduating from college hasn't really made me successful. Running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim. They're like half merits. They're great. A lot of people maybe not have done it. A lot of people have excelled further. They're kind of like stepping stones that I still will no life long benefit from doing other than the fact that I can say that I've done. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Yeah, no problem. Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy being in this computer. Thank you. Goodbye. Oh, goodbye. I'm going to press this button now. I think we're good here.",
         "Okay, here's my summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nLately, I've been feeling worried, anxious, and tense. A lot of it stems from my mom's health issues, which are stressing me out. Job hunting is also a major source of anxiety. The baby on the way adds to the feeling of being overwhelmed. I try to cope by keeping myself busy, exercising, and playing guitar, but it feels more like a distraction than a real solution. \n\nThe problem is, nothing really makes me happy anymore. Even when I achieve something, like learning a new song or having a good workout, the joy is fleeting. I feel good sometimes, but I'm never truly *happy* or excited. My life feels like a mix of okay times and okay-bad times, but nothing is ever extremely good or extremely bad. I wish I could feel inspired and motivated again. The last time I was really happy is so far back I can barely remember it.",

         "Okay. All right. Thanks. Go ahead.\n\nHow are you doing today?\nI'm okay.\n\nWhere are you from originally?\nI grew up in Wisconsin, and I lived in Colorado for a bit, and then I lived overseas for a little while, and then I moved to California.\n\nWhen'd you move to LA?\nJune of last year so I guess it's been eight months something like that.\n\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nAt the most probably twice a year.\n\nHow does it compare to LA?\nWell my hometown is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of LA.\n\nWhy do you miss LA?\nIt's a good question. I've always wanted to live in California but I had been living in the central coast and I just have been coming down to LA like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me. The client I had who was really the main financial source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I'll give LA a try and see what happens. So I gave it a shot and here I am.\n\nHow easy was it for you that you still live in LA?\nNo not at all. It's a very very big city. I lived in Dublin in Ireland which is also a big city but European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy. So just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging.\n\nDo you travel a lot?\nI love to travel. I lived in Ireland and I traveled. I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica. I spent some time in Mexico.\n\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nI love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures and also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go.\n\nI'd love to hear about one of your friends.\nSure. I'm trying to think which was my favorite. There's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days and we went to 3 different locations. We went up in the Atlas Mountains which are beautiful. It's a really really cool culture.\n\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nMy most memorable moment of that trip was being on a bus and leaving Dublin and going down to the countryside and seeing how breathtakingly beautiful it is. Everyone sees pictures of Ireland or you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experience it. The pictures don't do it justice.\n\nWhat did you study at school?\nI have an undergrad degree in English and Psychology and a psychology minor and I have a masters degree in Women's Studies.\n\nAre you still working on that?\nNo, I use my English and Psychology. I work in marketing communications. I actually do sales. The psychology definitely comes into play. I guess my undergrad degree in English but really I took that on and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I wasn't wanting to teach.\n\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nI guess I'm not clear on the question. Let's come back to that later. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me.\n\nWhat's your dream job?\nMy dream job is being a motivational speaker and trainer and coach and traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people.\n\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nMy relationship is pretty good actually. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother. She was sporadic. I saw her sporadically growing up. My dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with. I got in communication with my biological mother last May and we've cleared things up and have been in communication since then.\n\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nSometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screen saver. I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got.\n\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI love to dance. I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharges my battery actually. Probably more than anything else. I like to be with friends. I love art and trying new restaurants. All those things are both relaxing. I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life.\n\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nDepends. If I'm driving not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it.\n\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about?\nLast time I argued with somebody. Probably would have to be with the LA Times about the newspaper delivery. The newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of, it didn't show up. I didn't realize that it wasn't there until late afternoon. I think early afternoon. I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10.30 in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. For a service that would pay for it for every day. I was really irritated. I was angry with the LA Times. I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. It was pretty frustrating.\n\nTell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently.\nOh wow, there are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program. It was from one of the coaches in the program. She was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be, we have meetings every week, classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with. She called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach. That hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god I have all these people I have to be accountable to and I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people. I just was, I don't know. So, yeah, I wasn't angry. I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it. Yeah, I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother.\n\nThe hardest decision.\nWow, there's been a few. Moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision. No, it wasn't even the hardest decision. It was such an easy decision actually, but telling my family about it was challenging. The hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family. I was 28 and I decided to, I chose to move to Colorado. And that was a pretty tough decision. At that point my family had been within an hour's drive of wherever I lived, an hour, hour and a half, and now they're going to be a 12 hour drive away or a plane ride away. So that was challenging.\n\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nOh, lots of things. I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful, beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin. And at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado. So there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single. That was another factor. And were interested in the things I was interested in. So Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. So yeah, and then I found a job that I liked. The pay was atrocious, but I found some work that was really rewarding. So it all came together and I chose to move.\n\nThat sounds like a great situation. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nThat's a totally unrelated question. Relatively easily. It just depends on what time I go to sleep. If I'm out and I don't get home until 1130, then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today. But generally I can sleep through the night. I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks. But even so, even when I wake up from those or if I stir from those, I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily.\n\nAre they triggered by something?\nYeah, I'm sure they are. I'm in another transition state. I'm moving out of the house that I live in right now where I take care of an elderly woman. I have defined the financial means to support me in doing that. She creates a lot of anxiety in her state of being. She's exhausting and utterly depressing.\n\nHow hard is that?\nLiving with her is pretty hard. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done. I would never ever choose to do it again. Honestly, if I knew what I was getting into, I don't think I would have said yes to the situation.\n\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI feel trapped and helpless. There's no way out of the situation that I'm in. No matter what I do, it doesn't get any better. I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do. My money's not working at all. It feels pretty crappy.\n\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nI have in the past.\n\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nA long time ago. I was 15 or 14. It was over 20 years ago.\n\nWhat got you to see the outcome?\nI was suicidal.\n\nDo you feel down?\nOh yeah, I feel down.\n\nDo you still go to therapy now?\nI don't actually, no.\n\nWhy did you stop?\nI originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed. We had worked on what needed to be worked on. I was no longer depressed. Then I began therapy again later on. It was in my early 30s. Then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland.\n\nDo you feel like therapy's useful?\nYeah, depending on the therapist and depending on your intention. I don't go into therapy thinking, oh, I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years. I think that's ridiculous. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just that, not just creating a solution in that area, but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to worry about it.\n\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nLast time I felt really happy. That's pretty sad. It was at least a year ago. No, that's not true. It was when I saw my biological mother, which was last May.\n\nWhat would you say are some of your best qualities?\nMy best qualities. I'm strong, very strong-willed. I'm very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent.\n\nIs there anything you regret?\nAnything I regret? I don't think so. No.\n\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nDon't take life too seriously.\n\nTell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nOh, my ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends. Either going out a night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar, somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to... And then I have brunch with friends. I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day.\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nI am most proud of a few things. I've moved to places that I wanted to move to. I've done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something, been dear to my heart to actually achieve those goals or those... Yeah, I've done things that I've wanted to do, like move to Ireland and move to California.\n\nOkay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nSure. Goodbye. Bye. Just a little bit of a... Finish up with a quick post survey. So...",
         "Okay, here's my story regarding depression:\n\nI was diagnosed with depression a long time ago, when I was only 14 or 15. It was triggered by feeling suicidal. I did go to therapy then, and it was helpful. I stopped when I felt like we'd worked through the issues and I was no longer depressed. I went back to therapy again in my early 30s, but stopped when I moved to Ireland. I do think therapy can be useful, depending on the therapist and your own intentions. You go in to work on specific problems and find solutions, not to be in therapy for years.\n\nRight now, I'm feeling down. I feel trapped and helpless in my current living situation, taking care of an elderly woman. It's exhausting and utterly depressing. I feel like there's no way out, and no matter what I do, things don't get better. I'm not getting the work I want, and my finances aren't working out. It feels pretty crappy.",

I'll try to sometimes assist in the thought of some of those. OK. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Boston. Really? When did you move to LA? About 30 years ago. That's a long time. Yep. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Oh, I love living in LA. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. Why did you move to LA? Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. The beginning of the first few weeks where it was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? Broadcast journalism. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. Are you still working on that? Nope. Why? Well, it's kind of a long story, but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just, once I had done that work, I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Yep. What's your dream job? My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Nice. How hard is that? Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to, I don't travel so much right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like where I'm from. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday. Cause I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international dateline. And I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part. And I got to be there for a whole weekend, just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you and it's amazing. It's just a beautiful, beautiful spot in the world. Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More shy. Why? That's a good question. Partly the first thing I think of is cause I've always been that way, but maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. So. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach cause I live close to the beach. So that's one of my favorite things to relax. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations, but not at people directly. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Not sure I have one at the moment. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That just makes me really mad. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. I didn't know that I could do it. I wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. So that felt like a really difficult decision, but in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time, it was really difficult to do that. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment. So that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm like great, but it's because I am worried. But I'm also confident that things are gonna work out. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either. Sort of like just a even keel. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, I got to go to my friend's work at the Motion Picture Academy. So I get to see all the Oscar nominated movies. How was it? She was there one night, so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again. So that was very pleasant. Nice. How would your best friend describe you? I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. Is there anything you regret? No, I really worked hard on that. I think there are lots of things maybe I would do differently, but there's nothing that really I regret. So what? Well, I just think that there are things that, like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good question. Don't worry about the small stuff and save more money. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, you know, the normal things, like I'd lose more weight than I would. I think be a little more fearless maybe. Be a little more bold. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't think I have any of those. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Well, I am self-employed, so I work all the time. So my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something I enjoy. So that would be ideal at this point, my weekends, if I were really busy. What are you most proud of in your life? That I've really been able to take care of myself and that I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do. I've done that. And I don't have regrets about things. There's nothing really that feels undone in my life. Sure, there's plenty of things I still wanna do, but I feel like I've done what I said I was gonna do. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, that's not so great. Well, it's okay. Both my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister, but they both live on the East Coast and I live in LA. And then my sister has two girls, so I feel very close to my nieces, although we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers, so they have other things on their mind. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my teacher. He's the person I learned my holistic body work from. I really like to model my work and my way of being after him. Like he's a good role model for me, the way he holds his work and the way he lives his life. That's so good to hear. How close are you to them? We're pretty close. We're not best of friends, but I know that I can call him anytime I need him. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or... Yeah, just spending time with my friends. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thanks. Goodbye. Bye. It worked again. That was where I was feeling... Okay, good. I'd like to hear that. Now I'm going to have you move over to the other computer so you can do a quick post survey about your experience.",
         "Okay, here's my experience with depression. I haven't been formally diagnosed with depression, but I don't feel super happy all the time. I also can't remember the last time I felt really happy, so I guess I just maintain an even keel. I worry about money a lot, and that affects my mood.",

         "Okay cool. There I am. All right, thank you so much.\nI'm doing all right.\nYeah, from Maryland. Yeah, Maryland, Washington DC area like five weeks ago.\nIt's a lot less. It's not as nice this time of year. LA is a lot better though. There are a lot more people, a lot more going on. I guess I'm still getting used to it, it's coming slowly, but surely.\nI live in Culver City.\nI do.\nI have one. It's okay. I live in a really nasty house. It's cheap because I'm living in a friend's place and he's letting me stay there for half price, but the actual place itself is pretty horrible living conditions. But I'm moving soon.\nNo, I traveled. I would say I probably traveled more than most people in the US, considering that most people don't travel in the US. But I wouldn't call myself a world traveler. I enjoy the chance to get to see other walks of life and kind of like meditate on the specificity of my own. Given the parameters that I grew up under, like how different everyone else is, like how every life is totally. I mean, even just within the US, like seeing how someone in California grows up is so different from how someone in Maryland grows up. And then to think about someone in like Thailand or something growing up. It's pretty amazing.\nWell, it's been a while since I've been on a trip. I guess one of the last trips I did was to. A lot like two years ago, I went on a road trip across the US and that was pretty amazing. Though I guess the best two places on the road drove from Maryland to LA. This is before I actually moved out here, but I visited New Orleans and New Orleans was just this whole, even though it's part of the US, it's totally different than anywhere else. It's so unique. The culture there is so unique and the blend of like Caribbean and French and all these other influences into like the American South is so incredibly unreal.\n\nAre you capable of that?\nYeah.\nFilm. You know, that's actually a question I've been asking myself. My entire life I've had phases of interest. So when I was very young, I was really into keys and then tools. Like I'd go around collecting keys and then I go around collecting tools, like just every sort of tool. I had a toolbox. My parents have told me that I had a phase before that with balls. Then I was really into insects, collecting insects and reptiles and animals and then the dinosaur phase. At a certain point I got really into music, like first rap and then guitar and then acting. At some point in there, I remember telling someone that right now I'm interested in playwriting and poetry, but eventually I was going to be interested in film. I could kind of see the trajectory coming, but I don't remember what led me to that conclusion. I think I just always led a sheltered life as far as movies are concerned. My parents didn't let me see an R rated movie until I was in high school almost. I never saw an R rated movie. I was also very squeamish. I remember when I was fairly young, maybe like six, I saw Star Wars. The first scene of Darth Vader breaks the guy's neck. It's just a little scene at the very beginning and that freaked me out and I had to leave the room. So I'm not really sure how I got into film, but I've always been fascinated by how people interact and acting and movies in general.\nYes. To be a filmmaker, to be able to direct and put together and make movies. I guess direct, I don't use that word so much because I think of it more as like I want the opportunity to put together and make movies. I want involvement in all the processes, but the best parable for that would be a director.\nWell, it's a lot better when I'm not living with them.\nIt's funny you should ask. I've been thinking about it a lot lately. I think I'm closest with my dad. I get along with my brother and sister, but I don't. My brother's in a foreign country right now, so I don't have the opportunity to talk with him. But I spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else because I feel like he's the one who most accepts me and thinks positively about me. So I have a complicated relationship with my parents and my family in general.\nWell, on the Myers-Briggs personality test I'm an extrovert, but I'm not. I probably would consider myself extremely introverted. I see other extroverts and no matter who they're around they're able to strike up conversations. I'm a fairly shy person, inhibited person maybe. So I like to, but I'm working on it.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I can only just take screen saver.\n\nSo what do you do to relax?\nWell, in the past I would smoke weed, but I've quit smoking weed. So now I have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie. Or maybe go. If it's a worn-out sort of stress, then that's what I do. But if it's a more anxious type stress, I might go on an intense walk. Don't really exercise that much, but I like competitive sports and hiking.\nWell, I always like arguing. I wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper. I enjoy a vicious debate. As long as I won't revert to personal attacks in my arguments, I try to keep it on subject and try to explain myself as best I can, which can get frustrating because I'm not the best articulator of what I think. One of my weaker points I would say.\n\nWhat happened?\nI forget the question.\nLast time I had a heated debate was about the movie Boogie Nights. I didn't lose my temper exactly, but I get very passionate about it.\n\nWhy did they think it was the best movie?\nThey think that all of the stories within Boogie Nights, each of them could be their own separate stories. They just think that there's a complexity of character within the movie and that somehow it's like the end of an era, which makes it kind of like Casino and there's attention to detail of the different characters, how they interact in the plot. I think the heated debate became about that. Personally, it's not like a bad movie or anything, but I just don't think Dirk Diggler is that meaningful of a character. The way I came out of the movie is basically the same even though in watching it again, I was able to reevaluate it. There's nothing bad about the movie. There's good solid acting. The directing is good. The camera moves are cool. But for me it was meaningless. And then they were saying that a movie that I saw recently that I really did like was Django Unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme heated part of the conversation. In the movie Django Unchained, you have Django and Django is a two-dimensional character, but I don't think that necessarily takes away from what the big purpose of the movie is. And you have Dr. King Schultz who's this mentor character and the person I was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and because he was intelligent, there's no way he would have risked his life to save Django or would have gone into this second act where they go to this plantation to save Django's wife, etc. The reason for her giving that argument, either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't, is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themselves for someone else, which strikes me as like. Her basic argument was that altruism doesn't exist. It was a very Ayn Rand type argument. The only thing people do is serve themselves. All people are out to serve themselves. I'm not arguing that every decision has a mix of altruism and something. Even the most altruistic type decision, there's maybe kernels of self-interest in there, but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor. It led it to an extremely passionate debate. I don't think I necessarily lost my temper. I think of losing my temper as reverting to ad hominem attacks. I wasn't criticizing her worldview.\n\nYeah, I'm glad you understand.\nI don't know if I necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory. I would say an issue that I have is not being able to remember in as much detail as I would like. I remember feelings and moments, not stories. My life doesn't always sink together into a coherent story. It's like this moment and that moment.\nCould it just be one of the hardest decisions?\nI'm having a hard time recalling a moment where I had to choose between two options. There's no Sophie's Choice type moment in my life. But I do think that the decision to leave New York after having lived there for five years was very difficult. I had to do it for money reasons and because all my core group of friends were leaving and going other places in the world and the one other person I was close to was living with someone who I did not get along with at all. It was either gonna live with people who I wasn't as close with or Craigslist or move home. It was a tough decision to leave. In fact, it was so tough that I had to justify it by saying that I would be moving back to New York within a month or two, which didn't end up happening.\n\nHow hard was that?\nIt was hard. It was isolating. I had fallen in love with one of my closest friends and that had gone extremely badly. So I wasn't on speaking terms with her and everyone on my list of friends who was closer to her. It wasn't quite her or me, but that was the way that I saw it at the time. I was socially isolated.\nWell, recently it's been awful. I like to. Last night I slept for ten and a half hours, which seems to be the length of time that I have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams. But previous to that night, the night before last and the night before that I got four hours and two hours of sleep because I was working on set and I would get back and I just couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason. Too much riled up energy or something.\n\nTired?\nNot immediately. Initially upon waking up, I had really enjoyed being up in the early morning and I also stopped drinking caffeine. I've had a little bit of coffee the last two days, but before the last two days, I hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks. With caffeine in my system, I'm ready to go. Without caffeine, I'm quieter, more introverted.\n\nSince when?\nChanging my thoughts. I mean, I guess when having just moved here, there was a period of time at the beginning where the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people because I moved here because I have a group of friends here or a couple of friends. The push to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first. I think that I'm slowly coming into terms with that and moving past it, but the pressure is still there.\n\nNo.\nThe last time I felt really happy might have to reach back. I think the last time I felt really happy was during the writing process. Last year I shot a movie, co-wrote, co-directed, co-produced. That still consumes my life, but during the writing stages of that movie, we would bunk down, eat breakfast, work really hard, pure creative energy between me and the person writing it. I remember going to bed and I was so thrilled to be working on what I was working on and working with the person I was working with. I felt like it. That was more than a year ago though, but when you're making a movie, you can't allow yourself to be happy, especially if you're doing it by yourself.\n\nI would say that I'm very accepting of other people and always very empathic and open, excited about new ideas and open to new ideas.\nI guess I wish I was less ruled by fear, more fearless in my everyday interactions and in my zest for living.\n\nI think there are numerous instances in my childhood in which my parents were always on the other side of the court. Other parents were like if their kid was in trouble, their kid was perfect. There's something wrong with other people, but my parents were always the opposite. In particularly my mom, so I would say that there are a couple of instances in which I was blamed when what I was doing was.\n\nTen years ago.\nStay stay stay. I think that I have a tendency to get really caught up in an idea and devote myself entirely to it, but sometimes ideas are too easily. Do as much as possible. Don't decide that you are only going to do one thing. Learn to read music. I'd love to learn how to play the drums. I'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more acting classes. It's only now that I.\n\nGoodbye.",
         "Okay, here's my story regarding my experiences with depression:\n\nThings have been rough lately, especially with sleep. I've had nights with only two to four hours of sleep because I was working on set. Then I have trouble falling asleep. I felt a lot of pressure when I first moved to LA, trying to find a job and meet people. It was overwhelming, but I think I'm slowly getting used to it, though the pressure is still there.\n\nIt's hard to remember when I was last truly happy. I think it was during the writing process of a movie I co-wrote, co-directed, and co-produced last year. We had so much creative energy. But when you're making a movie, especially independently, it's hard to allow yourself to be happy. I wish I was less ruled by fear and more fearless in my everyday interactions and zest for living.",

         "This is kind of fun.\n\nAlright. Thank you. Hi, I'm Aria. Thanks for coming in today. Are you okay with this?\nYeah, I'm totally fine. I'm just a little bit nervous.\nThat's good. So, how you doing today?\nI'm doing pretty good. Hanging out. Nice weather. I just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you, the digital you that I'm seeing. It's funny because I've just always thought that the conveying of emotions or feelings be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself.\nThank you.\nI'm from Born and raised in Los Angeles Venice area Marvista specifically. That's where I'm from.\nWell, there's a lot more that I don't like, but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up, that the idea of certain medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent topic, very thought upon, and I feel that Los Angeles' deep culture is why I stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand. The human mentality here is very hectic, very chaotic, a lot due to the vehicle, the car, the freeway, and this idea that we're on a grind. It's a very hectic human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing.\nUm From my travels, it's not like well, I do enjoy a lot of things about travel, but it's more like I enjoy not being trapped in the city with all these made up ties and restraints. I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this faux man-made image that it is here. So I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is.\nThanks. Would you Okay\nWell, I kind of recently last year went to Los Banos Central California area and although it wasn't that far from LA, it was completely different energy. There was no phones. There was no Wi-Fi. There's no TV there was sanity there was relative sanity in the sense that people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chill and I was working at a hot spring resort And I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry. You don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so I just wanted to get out of here and experience the real deal.\nWell Currently I'm studying Physical therapy. I'm about to become licensed massage therapist. But before that I was going to for music composition so I was just writing scores for films animations dance productions theater productions. Yeah, it was cool. It was fun trippy very trippy but I had to leave that because tuition hikes going up to like 50,000 a year for like a four-year BFA is not the deal not trying to trap myself with these chains of federal loans. So yeah\nDream job. Hmm My dream job would be anything that I can do to alleviate these metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they've been put in. My dream is to alleviate the nightmare. My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and with physical therapy and artistic expression, I've got some great ideas. Yeah\nI guess more outgoing. I just like experiencing things so outgoing. Yeah\nI do to relax is just kind of breathe it out chill. Maybe make a smoothie or some tea. I'm gonna go bike riding right\nWell, it wasn't arguing I don't really argue much I just like to save my opinion and have it be understood and I like the person I'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was I guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from New York and we were talking about writing and basically, we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written. Yeah, so yesterday\nThat's tough. I haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt. What about you? What's something you feel guilty about?\nI don't really wish I could erase anything from my memory because then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased, you know butterfly effect kind of like.\nMaybe the time she was going to school, I was taking the year off, and I was just kind of hanging around. But we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn't turn out. Nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it, but this one turned out a little different actually quite different than I thought it would be in I thought it was funny but yeah, it ended up me leaving before the lease ended and it actually ended up yeah with us separating but that's something I wish Maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully.\nHardest decision Hmm Maybe not a hard dissed but a hard decision I had to make was leaving school dropping my continuation of achieving a BFA. Yeah, that could have been the hardest\nI mean, of course money is a big issue tuition hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan to support that but that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around and but another reason why I decided to leave had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because Art Institute, you know, that's a it's a funny idea in itself already and basically I was a musician being taught by a musician to make music and same with you know, all the other dancers or the theater students, you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance, you know, and it's just it's just not quite as artistic as I thought art would be art Comes from somewhere somewhere sweet and deep and purple and not not from out there, you know, so yeah\nIf it's kind of easy I mean it depends, you know if I remember to make some chamomile tea or if I remember to breathe and go through my mantras or remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then I can get into it real nice But if I just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until I remember to breathe. Yeah\nUm, yeah, basically just what I said just breathing or you know If I'm hanging out with friends coming home late, and if I get the lucky chance to be medicated from you know a nice nice indica Then it really does, you know indica does put me down pretty nice Pretty drowsy. So a lot of things breathing, you know, you know medical herbs like chamomile cannabis and just leaving myself of bad bad juju\nI guess not if I can't think of something now I've been feeling kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a gray line But it's a nice gray. It's a really nice hue Some people wouldn't like this, but I really like that and it's stable Yes, it's comfortable. Yeah\nNo, I haven't Not by a certified medical professional no, but no I haven't\nYeah, I mean I just think like the whole You know, like you said PTSD depression and you know other you know mental instabilities. I think everybody is depressed. I think everybody is overjoyed. I think everybody's angry I think everybody's shy everybody's social all at the same time, you know, it's just Different days different variants different floats different boats, you know different waves different swells So yeah, I think I'm depressed. I think I'm really happy. I think I'm really angry. I think I'm really friendly, you know all that But just on different variants different floats\nReally happy\nI mean I feel really happy a lot and I feel really sad a lot but really happy was I guess maybe this morning when I was just biking over here just enjoying the Sun enjoying the breeze Biking yeah\nWell, I have a lot of best friends and they describe me all pretty differently but underlying that same idea maybe I'm just maybe in a nutshell just kind of Aquarius, I guess\nI Am 21 so 20 years ago, I would have told myself to keep being a baby Stay young and don't lose sight, you know, don't stop listening Keep letting things happen. Don't make them happen be be a beautiful baby. That's what I would have told myself. be a beautiful baby\nI guess recently what has been shown to me through me by me is my ability to work with others and I'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint, I've been a collaborating a lot with artists working on a lot of different mediums mixed media projects and I'm really comfortable with it and with other people's and melting our ideas together. Yeah\nThat's a weird question like trying to make me single out the one moment that I today reflect upon and think about like it's some past glory that I'm not capable fulfilling today So I think the proudest moment of my life is right now chilling Hanging with you Yeah\nYeah, thank you\nIt's interesting my immediate family is a Mother father younger sister older brother older brother is in South Asia Just kind of backpacking around Younger sis she's really chill. She kind of does music too, and we just hang out We're really cool. Mom mama. I'm really chill with lover to death She gets me and dad He doesn't get me but I Love the art that he makes he he does crazy painting and I kind of get him through that but uh yeah, there needs to be more communication which is being worked upon\nCool yeah, thanks for wondering about my thoughts Goodbye Goodbye\nSo I guess I push this guy oh So I can still talk to you",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, from my perspective:\n\nI haven't been officially diagnosed with depression, but I believe everyone experiences a range of emotions, including depression, happiness, anger, and shyness. It's just that the intensity and frequency vary from person to person. I definitely feel really happy a lot, like this morning when I was biking in the sun. But I also feel really sad a lot too. Lately, I've been cruising on a \"gray line,\" which is stable and comfortable for me. To cope with difficult feelings, I rely on breathing exercises, chamomile tea, and sometimes cannabis. I try to rid myself of bad energy. If I remember to breathe and follow my routines, I can manage my thoughts. If I get caught up in my thoughts, it takes longer to get back on track.",

I moved in there and he told me that he didn't have any marijuana or marijuana plants because he didn't want to be around. He had that so I had to move out because he had a self-in-living room. Yeah, it does. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and him would handle differently.\nI don't know. Good question. Probably... Probably, I don't know, probably with an ex-boyfriend. We broke up.\nOkay. Can you tell me about that?\nYeah, it's in the past. I'm over him. He was a jerk anyway.\nOkay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nHardest decision?

It's been a while. It's been like, god, more over two years.\nCan you tell me about that?\nUm, I didn't have any money problems. I was doing fine. Um, yep. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed?\nOh, what did I do? Um, I was with my cats at home here in California and they're playing outside.\nTell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nMy ideal weekend would be nice.

Um, I persevere.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nYeah, I'd rather not. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nUh, me a few years ago.

People say I have pretty eyes. Um, like a dress up. What are some things you like to do for fun?\nFor fun? I like to try surfing. Go shopping. Maybe go to art galleries. That's good.

         "I've been feeling down lately, mostly because I'm struggling financially and don't have a boyfriend. It's been over two years since I felt truly happy, back when I didn't have money problems. Lately, I've just been feeling more sad than usual. While I haven't been diagnosed with depression, it's been hard. I get frustrated because I'm poor and don't want to be. Leaving home to try for a better life in California was a hard decision, and while I miss home, I try to persevere. I find some comfort in small things, like watching my cats play and sometimes turning on a fish tank screensaver when I feel tense.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just here to talk to people in safe and secure environments. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything, your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes.\nSo, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. That's good. Where are you from originally? Uh, California. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather, I like the people. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. That's primarily it. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Sociology. Really? Yep. How did you decide to do that? It's a topic that just really interested me, the most out of all the other subjects. Are you still working on that? No. What's your dream job? To be a writer. Can you tell me about that? I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in. Like what? Like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. What do you think of today's kids? I think they have it pretty easy. They don't know how easy they have it. Do you travel a lot? No, not really. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing. What do you do to relax? I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing. Or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing like watch TV. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long. Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. Why? Because they basically sort of raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much. I understand. Tell me about a situation that you wish you could erase from your memory. Uh... I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yeah. Yes. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Um... I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Uh... because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision, I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh... my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh... not really super easy. I sort of... I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Uh... normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh... last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends right now? Uh... probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Uh... I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh... no. I don't think. I think regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um... Don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um... Sometimes I can be kind of lazy. I'd like to have more of a sort of better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh... just sort of putting off stuff until you know right when it's due or after it's due things like that. procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh... sometimes for the things that I write, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um... I guess I'm most proud of the fact that I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um... just hanging out with my friends. people watching. Watching a movie that's good. listening to music. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.",

         "Okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? California, here in Los Angeles. Really? Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? I love being near the beach. I love living in a big city. And I love the fact that I have lots of friends and family here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Just so many, sometimes too many people. But apart from that, I'm generally happy here. Okay. What did you study at school? Photography and language studies. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I love photography. I was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well. So I wanted to continue to learn more about it. And with languages, I come from a mixed background. So I wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic background. How hard is that? It wasn't hard. It was a passion. So I enjoyed it. Are you still working on that? I'm not, no. What's your dream job? To do photography full-time, and also to do some of the things that I'm passionate about more creatively. Like what? I have an idea. I'd like to make a robe line. Women's robes and things like that. Awesome. Mm-hmm. Do you travel a lot? I have. I've traveled quite a bit, and I love travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different cultures, different countries, meeting new people, all of that. And the language. What are some of your trips? I lived in Greece for over a year. I taught English there and moved around to different parts of Greece and really had a great time. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think just having my group of friends that I met there and going through the experience with them. I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to Elefonissos in a car with everybody and having just a fantastic time. That sounds like a great situation. Yes, it was. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm shy to begin with, and as I get to know people, then I'm much more outgoing. What do you do to relax? I just stay at home. Maybe watch a movie. Rest in bed. Watching a movie in bed. That's probably one of the things I like to do to relax. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I think very good. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? It was probably with my boyfriend regarding money issues. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now. Can you tell me about that? I'm having some struggles in my career right now. Financially, it's becoming very difficult. I'm sorry. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it has been difficult, but I've been working very hard to remedy that. That's great. Can you give me an example of that? While I'm here, I'm doing this focus study. I'm doing many things to generate more money, working harder, but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my career. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Probably being raped. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Sometimes. Are they triggered by something? Not that I'm aware of. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling stressed and worried. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't seem to have any problem with it. I seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm grumpy and lethargic in the morning. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was probably deciding to not have a child. Can you tell me about that? I was pregnant and wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy. That was also due to financial burden. The father I was involved with did not want the child. I made that very difficult decision. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Really, really happy. I know. When I went to Cancun on a holiday over the New Year period. How did you feel in that moment? I felt absolutely fantastic. I felt happy. I felt relaxed. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world temporarily. Free. That's great. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive. Definitely more assertive. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I would say I'm a wonderful friend. When I love somebody, I love them very deeply. Friends, family, boyfriend. I think that's good. I'm very loyal as a friend. I'm honest. I care about people. I'm fun to be with. I think those are some of my best qualities. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, with my father, is not so great. My parents were divorced when I was young. He's sort of been in and out of my life forever. Mostly out. It's not fantastic, but it's something that I'm used to. It's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then I lost him. It's still not the best situation. I still wish that could be remedied somehow. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. I love her so much. She's been there for me since I was very, very young. She's always been just incredible. I love her so much. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so I don't have to work so hard now. Okay. Is there anything you regret? I regret exactly that. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy. That was probably one of the best times in the last few weeks. Tell me about your kids. They're great kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren. There are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. We're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot. It's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them or overpunish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child. It's really difficult so I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to travel the world and live in many, many other places around the country and around the world. The fact that I've learned several languages and the fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends. Okay. I think I've asked everything on YouTube.

I don't really Get angry or anything like that. I tend to keep it in Or try to release it by writing. Um, I actually can't remember the last time I argued with someone.\nAll the people I've hurt in the past Well, I Like cheated on people Hurt their feelings intentionally Done things I shouldn't have done that I regret now.\nWell with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now I probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out.\nHardest decision I've ever had to make was Man I really don't know actually.\nTell me about your experience or the symptoms you've been most likely to experience.\nTell me about that.\nJust seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible.\nMe and my family aren't very close. We don't I mean they've always been there for me and I appreciate it But we've never had that close connection Especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it's pretty different when it comes to those racial I mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of step each other each other's feet on But aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other. It does get kind of awkward, but it's okay.\nI Think they are out of control.

They're being applauded by celebrities that they follow And there's not enough being done about it, and they're just getting lost.\nUm depends on the night some nights. It's pretty hard some nights. I fall asleep like a baby. Usually creative actually when I can't sleep. I'll just stay up, and I'll write something or I read a book and ideas will pop up.\nLately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I'm energized and I'm alive And then some not some days when I'm just you know just sitting there Just mellow thinking Not like my live self I don't know. It's just always been like that always have those ups and those downs, but they kind of balance each other out.\nNo.\nNo.\nThe last time I felt really happy was Hmm today Just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day I Went to see you some friends. We had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers Wrote a good essay feel pretty accomplished, and I feel like my day is just a good day.\nMy best friend would describe me as odd most people would describe me as odd I Say a lot of odd things I do odd things I'm interested in things that most people aren't Um just like old literature Revolutionary stuff stuff about changing the world, but through underground means.\nUm no, I don't live a life of regret.\nTo never let fear stop you from doing anything.\nReading just hanging out with some friends driving around finding something to do just go on an adventure.\nI Don't wish I could change anything about myself. I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be.\nUm this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and She pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time how I've hurt people how I've hurt her The ways I've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all.\nMy parents I Mean although we don't see eye to eye that always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day Although I never listen to them or I don't choose to listen to them Once it happens I learned from it and I'm like, oh, that's what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learned to Understand that they are wiser than me and that they do know more than me.\nI'm not so much anymore. I travel around LA try to find new sites to see but as far as I don't travel outside I'm discovering new things discovering things you never knew were there or the limitless possibilities I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures New things that go against what's normal for us and for myself.\nA Few days ago, I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert I had to offer and it was just enjoyable I felt free away from all this These cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time felt good.\nI'm most proud that I've always been different That despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird or I'm odd or I think weird things I've always maintained my original mentality.\nYou",

         "Okay. But, I think now you can have a seat. Thank you. Alright. Now I'm going to put the doorbell over here. When she's done, she'll let you know to press that button. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just creating this talk to people instead of interviewing them. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions as a starter. Your answers are fully appreciated. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing really good. That's good. Where are you from or is your home? I'm from Granada Hills, California. It's the San Fernando Valley, part of Los Angeles. Cool. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. I like the diversity in people. I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one race or kind of food. I love the beaches. All the activities you could go do. Theme parks, aquariums, stuff like that. Museums. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The smog. There's a lot of creepy guys. Do you travel a lot? I've pretty much traveled around LA. I've been cross-country back three times. Twice was when I was 17. Wow. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live. I'd love to know the only place. When I was 17, I ran away with my boyfriend to upstate New York to Watertown. It was like a Navy Army kind of town. We had an apartment there. It snowed a lot. We sold antiques for a living. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Getting passes, press passes for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through a friend. Getting to meet rock stars and hang out at the private parties. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm very outgoing. I love people. What do you do to relax? I go to the gym and work out quite a bit. It helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going. I notice if I don't work out a couple days, I feel a little more tired than normal. It just helps me feel good. How are you at Conflict? I'm pretty good at it. I'm very calm. I've worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm. They're the customers, so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid because of the money they're spending. I'm good at resolving consumer conflicts and stuff on the job. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people. I started getting loud just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean. I wonder if you're talking to people like that, they might not like it and they could attack you or something. You never know. It is LA. That sucks. What's something you feel guilty about? I really don't feel guilty about anything, decisions I've made in my life. I think I've made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass, what I'm doing. I grew up in church, so I haven't gone in years, but I still have those values and the rules, the 10 Commandments and stuff in my head. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called the proper authorities and followed through on a court case instead of letting him bully me out because it wasn't up to code. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from. After a few months, he was coming to LA and going back home. I decided to move there and I had just started this business I was doing, event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there on the East Coast and it didn't work out. It was tough deciding, should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experience something new or stay in what I was doing. What did you study at school? I had a degree in dental assisting, I did that for a year, I didn't like it. Then I was studying communications, radio and television broadcasting and journalism. Are you still working on it? I'm doing event work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to get a website going and have where I'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of writing for someone else. How did you decide to do that? I always wanted to write and was always into the news and music and art growing up. I really liked Connie Chung, she was like a channel 4 newscaster in the 80s and I loved Barbara Walters. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My sister, she doesn't talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom. I never really knew my dad, it doesn't bother me. I have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them on phone, we just communicate on Facebook or Twitter. How easy is it for you to go to sleep? Oh, I go right to sleep. When I get tired I just go to sleep. How is it for you? Pretty good, energetic, I've been motivated to go look for more event work, event planning stuff and really grinding it more than I was. How hard is that? I mean it's kind of hard because you've got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I mean I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone I know dies. I wouldn't say that I'm just super like, oh my god, happy all the time but it's like an even keel that I feel pretty good all the time. What would you say are some of your best friends? I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them at ease and I could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene or situation or a group of people that I'm used to, I could still jump in, talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I want to make more money. Me too. Tell me about a time when someone knew you were really bad and knew about yourself. I remember in like second grade, people used to make fun of me because I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's, one of the highest grades in the class, so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or stuff like that. How would your best friend describe you? Very talkative. She would just say that I talk to everyone. And that I'm very friendly and if you need help, that I'll help someone, you know. Tell me about something you've been doing recently that you really enjoy. Recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like took him to the park and played and it was really nice and it was cool visiting her. I hadn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again. I like the area. What's something you feel close to about? I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more, like for my business instead of working for other people. I think I pursue it, but I think maybe I could put a little more time and day into it. I see. Tell me about maybe that or something maybe where you feel like it's coming from. I don't really know anything like that I want to erase or not happen. Okay. Is that what you mean by that? No, I feel good about my choices I've made and I think I'm on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do, the balls rolling and I'm getting things done. I'm not as big as I want to be, but I feel like I'm on my way there. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Like 10 years ago I would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as I was. My friend we call Mojo. Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball I'm rolling. He's one of the biggest people in my life telling me you're talented, you could do it. He's just a really good motivation for me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm going to get to that point. Great, thanks.",

         "You're saying right this is So let's just want to say one thing real quick here too late I Just want to say okay. I miss my recall isn't that good I don't know what the time I did with her last time because when I went back there I think they asked me questions like recall questions from this so I should try to be aware of like How I'm answering of which things about her Okay, all right, oh I see okay, I got you okay Well what she said no, okay, okay, I got you then all right. Thank you\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. My answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? Doing okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from LA. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. I like the sports teams. I like the entertainment. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's pretty much the same year-round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad. You don't get to get all four seasons, so it's kind of like a mixed bag. I guess maybe I'm kind of used to it by now, so it would be nice to explore other areas. I've lived here all my life, haven't done too much traveling, so it's a little bit of a ruddiness to it. But overall it's okay. Okay. What did you study at school? I took computer programming and operations, but that's going back to the 70s. What made you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? No, I kind of phased out. I still use computers, but I haven't been in programming for a long time. Why? Well, I kind of got into another area, kind of a diversion to another area in my life. This is going back to the late 70s. I kind of took another turn, and by the time I got back into it, I kind of got into another field. So I never really pursued it to the degree that I wanted to. What's your dream job? Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? What do you need to do to relax? I watch music. I watch TV. What do I do to relax? I just try to avoid stressful situations, so I kind of stay relaxed. I also talk to my friends, too. I'll be around an area, kind of a comfort area, where I feel safe. I can just dialogue with people. I'm not really worried about my own problems. I'm just focused on being in the moment with my friends and acquaintances. How are you at consoling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really have a temper problem. It takes a lot to get me to explode. In my younger days, I think I had a slight bit of temper. I never had a really bad temper, but temper is not really an issue I have. I tend to be pretty mellow, easy-going. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Wow, that's a good question. I'm not sure, to be honest. I didn't think about that for a long time. To be honest, I can't come up with an answer on that. It's not really part of my repertoire. Nothing comes to mind off the top of my head. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I don't really have too much family left. The only one I have is just me and my uncle. We communicate on a regular basis. He lives in Clearwater, Florida. We're okay. He's in his 80s, and I'm in my 50s. We have small talk. He's concerned about my well-being, but it's on a shallow level. We don't get really deep. He's got his own problems, so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation. Other than him, there's not really anybody else I have. It probably makes me a little bit depressed because I don't really feel I have anybody I can really count on or really confide in. How have you been feeling lately? Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Have you been diagnosed with depression? Why? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Let me think about that a minute. Actually, it wasn't that long ago. I helped out a lady at a trade show. It was at Anaheim Natural Products Expo. It was pretty nice. We had some nice meals afterwards. There were a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples. It was in Anaheim, so I got a chance to get away from LA. I met some interesting people. They were very outgoing. They were willing to have me experience their product or service. I was around people that I worked with who I got to socialize with. I think I was pretty happy back then. That was about a month ago. That sounds like a great situation. How would your best friend describe you? What would you say of some of your best colleagues? Is there anything you regret? What comes to your mind? What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I was going with other people's opinion, other people's advice. I was going away from my basic beingness, the way I really felt. For example, I would do aggressive investing, which if it turned out good, I would have been well off for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, it went the opposite way. I regretted going with my gut feeling and letting other people influence me. By nature, I'm a conservative person, so I should do more conservative investments. In other areas of my life, I tend to be more conservative, but I made some aggressive financial decisions. That always goes back to that area as far as what I regret. Tell me how you spend your weekend. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. I'll see you next time. Did you do one with her before you did this? You can take your headset off now. You can go back there. You're going to finish up with a quick survey about your experience. You're going to start by pressing this button. You're going to keep going until you hit the next big stop sign, and then you're going to press this button to let us know you're done. We really value feedback so you can take care of your answers.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, based on the interview, written from my perspective:\n\nI don't have much family left, just my uncle in Florida. We talk, but it's just small talk and doesn't go very deep. This probably makes me a little depressed because I don't feel like I have anyone I can really count on or confide in.",

         "Okay, no, I was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual person. Yeah, like a virtual reality thing. Okay. So how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York. Really? When did you move to LA? Oh, I moved to LA in the 70s, but I lived a lot of different places. Um, I guess every few years, but I travel a lot, so I've lived in Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Hong Kong, too. Different cultures, food, music, rituals, everything, the smells, the colors, makes you feel alive. Excuse me, one of my trips, oh, I lived in Kenya for about a year, I'd say. I love horseback riding, so when you're viewing other animals, when you're kind of disguised in the scent of a horse, you can approach the animals a lot closer. So it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along, you know, seeing so many animals. Yeah, in Kenya. Um, probably when I went to a Messiah village, and I happened to, I used to live in Hawaii and I had been to Tahiti and I was wearing one of those perraus that are hand painted and I had it tied over the left shoulder with a twisted or not. And I happened to enter a Messiah village for the first time that day and I looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed Messiah? And then they came back and gave me what appeared to be uh some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have like weighed my ears straight down and um and then then it gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper Messiah. So, but I you know, I just I have a lot of uh I think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world I just uh you feel like you're alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken. Yeah. I think it's not so clear cut. I think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both. I mean, I think I can be extremely shy sometimes, but extremely brazen uh and very courageous at other times. Probably one of my best virtues is I'm very gutsy person. So when I really feel passionate about something, I risk everything to go achieve it sometimes. Um, I believe that um usually well I make decisions very quickly and I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how I could make decisions quicker and I told him I said well in each case you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and I said not really because it's gut wise there's only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98 chance of failure even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so I always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice because who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yields no joy. What do you do to relax? Pardon? You said you put your fish in when you're annoyed. What do I do when I'm annoyed? I think when I'm annoyed sometimes like it's because sometimes I can have I need to be a little more patient I guess you really have to put yourself in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy. How hard is that? Not really. I think that's the reason why I enjoy traveling so much because you're put in other situations where you're forced to to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from yours different situations I've been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is. When was the last time you argued with someone and won? Let me think. Last time I argued about something I'm trying to remember. Oh, I think it's when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something. Can you tell me about that? Oh I know what it was it was somebody who belonged to the Scientology faith. I inherited possibly an immune disorder from my mother. My mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I have like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photosensitive and I had an episode where I had big flare up and I wasn't really feeling well and I was I was very flushing and everything and the Scientologist tells me that I needed to be audited and he said something about are you aware of past lives and I had told him that I was Buddhist and I was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed to be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware that about something in your past and I go yes I believe that many religions including Buddhism and Scientology believe that things that you have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you feel better make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe I said that you know that you have the power of each person has a godlike or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when I'm on the verge of possibly being I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years I don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it is I think when I think I'm on the verge I take sort of like and I did this even when I was a child when I was seven I would fall down I have my boo boo and I would take I would say I would have the good part you know help the bad part from a simplistic way in terms of a child and I would actually even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I concentrated healing and when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that you did her last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but I was just I think annoyed and irritated only because the Scientologist told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even a matter I said of whether he was whether he took 20 40 courses or whether I've been practicing Buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years or whether somebody been practicing some type of Christianity for 50 years and been sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so I just was thinking that is the antithesis of somebody who says they were enlightened but it's just the way I guess he kept going cramming his you know his faith down my throat that after a while I was pretty patient with it but then it was so pompous that I became irritated especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet this same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn't point it out to him because I just didn't even want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip because you need to be audited that something that you did in your past that you didn't want to do. So he had this idea of this person getting audited completely and I found my thought he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but, you know, I just didn't, you know, care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it. But other than that, I mean, I don't. Sometimes to have a little more tact, I guess, when in terms of patience. I can think of that right away. I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital. How did you decide to do that? My brother was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he is in the medical field. So my sister and I said, well, you know, he's the medical one. So he's probably used to seeing this all the time. But it turns out he was the weakest one. And even after, you know, my father kept, you know, bucking these, body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things. You see all this jerking of body movements and stuff. It was just very hard. But, you know, as after a while, the, you know, even the physicians and even the pastor from that particular, you know, hospital, they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that, his brain function would have been, you know, negligible. Yeah. That sounds very hard. Yeah, it was. Tell me about that or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Hmm. I don't think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I've had to block them, I really don't know what it is within my makeup, which doesn't make me feel like I need to. I don't keep I have friends that have unmitigated issues, which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear. And for some reason, I feel blessed that I don't really I can't really even think of something that I mean, I've had some bad situations happen to me, but it's not that for some reason they've traumatized me and affecting, you know, my behavior, where I would where I block it, that I'm not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason. So I really can't think of anything. I mean, there's bad things that happen and I know that there, but it's not like I feel like it's necessary for me to block them because I've been able to, you know. Except sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened. OK. How easy is it for you to make a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I can usually make myself sleep in any situation. If I have a one hour flight to San Francisco, I could just kind of lean against the window with a pillow, have the blanket over and even an hour flight pass out before the plane is even taken off from the ground. So I can I have literally when I've had little sleep and I very high energy. So I don't really need that much sleep. But say, like if I'm in Africa in a. Bumpy potholes, unpaved road, and I suddenly decide I need a few moments of sleep, I will just prop something up, put my elbow against the window and say, I think I'm going to take a nap for 15 minutes ago like this and through the jostling, I could just take a nap for 15 minutes. So I don't really have that problem. OK, pretty OK. I mean, I could deal without the skin flare ups, but, you know, from the photosensitivity and all that. But other than that, I'm pretty good spirits. Have I ever studied what? I've never studied using a behavior. I still couldn't hear you, I'm sorry. I've never studied changes in my behavior. What was the word? Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Uh-uh. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, I don't know, just with friends and everything, just even this past week, just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having a great meal, laughing, just, you know, having a good time, listening to music. Regret about my entire life, you mean, or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about? You know, it's funny, I find that a lot of the negative experiences that have happened in my life have also been opened up experiences that are also great that I have not overlooked. For example, I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my whole savings that I've had to start all over again. And sometimes people say to me, like, are you sure you're OK? Are you just pretending to be OK? Or are you angry? Do you want to seek revenge? If I was, you know, because my business partner essentially ripped me off. We knew each other's families, which was even more difficult in a way. And he stole essentially my whole life savings, essentially, in a way. And he got sent to prison. The FBI was involved. Interpol was involved. I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth. And. But, you know, if I hadn't get involved, I hadn't gotten involved with him in business, I wouldn't have had a lot of rich experiences. And I think sometimes the reason why. I don't know why I'm such a positive person, but for some reason I'm able to. It's not that I'm purposely trying to. I do see the positiveness in even a horrible situations. I wouldn't have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich. I wouldn't have learned to speak as good Spanish. German lived in in Europe if I had not got involved in business with my business partner, who ended up ripping me off. But and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that I developed during that period of time. And in a way, it was a total different life, a different world that that would, you know, that I would have never had the chance to live through if I had not been involved in my. But of course, it cost me financially. And but then again, I've always been a type of person who, you know, money is in everything. And I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it. So there you go. And for example, what are my favorite? Times in my life, probably when I lived in Kenya, and you would think that, you know, a lot of people have this really bad vision that I may be looking living in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively. I mean, it's not like that at all. But and you'd think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that, I mean, actually, and I really didn't have, you know, that much mean many material goods at the time. I mean, I had the blast. I had probably the one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya. The same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16. To live your life with passion. And again, like choose the way I was saying earlier about making decisions. You have to make those decisions gut wise. What will give you a sense of awe and wonderment? What will make you give you joy? And you have to it's regardless of what the percentages are, even if you only have a one percent chance of success, you have to go to that because that's the only thing that will yield, you know, the happiness in your life. Mm hmm. The fact that I've adhered to that and been brazen, whatever you want to say, have the balls, the chutzpah, the kahanist to go ahead and follow my passions. And, you know, I guess people call them sometimes strong decisions, usually decisions that are when you where you remain unscathed, usually don't yield joy. That's just Murphy's law. That's just the way it is. OK, I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Bye. Bye. Hi. Hi.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and we love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes. I'm doing okay.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nI'm from Greenwich, Connecticut.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhen did you move to LA?\nI moved here in 2008, so about five years ago.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI try to go back at least once a year. Sometimes I go more, sometimes less.\nHow does it compare to LA?\nOverall, I think I like where I'm from better than LA in general.\nWhy?\nI think that other than it being somewhere I'm familiar with, the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I'm used to and less superficial.\nI understand. Why did you move to LA?\nI moved out here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California.\nHow easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?\nInitially, it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience, so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once. But then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here, it became more difficult than originally.\nWhat's your study at school?\nFine Arts and Photography.\nThat sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?\nI was interested in photography since high school. I did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments. So I decided to pursue art.\nAre you still working on that?\nYes, I have a fine arts degree that I got last year.\nAwesome. Are you happy to do that?\nYeah, I really enjoy working or interning in forensics. I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography. I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nThat's an interesting question. I guess just my childhood in general, growing up.\nCan you tell me about that?\nWell, my family is very close, my extended family as well, and most of them live within the area or on the east coast in general. So we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that.\nThat sounds like a great situation.\nYeah, it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible, which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nI consider myself more shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI watch reality television. I think it's kind of funny and lighthearted.\nLike what?\nI watch like Bravo TV, like the Real Housewives shows, and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to.\nOkay. How are you at controlling your temper?\nI'm good, I guess. I don't really have like a temper. If I'm more stressed out, it definitely shows in my attitude, but I don't really have like anger.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nWhen me and my boyfriend bicker all the time just like about like insignificant things. But other than that, I had an argument with my dad a few days ago.\nCan you tell me about that?\nThere's been like some tension going on since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter, things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her, although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. So for like the 30th time, we were on the phone and he was telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I had told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend because of the Jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very immature and telling me, oh, forget it, she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like I could care less because I don't care about having a relationship with her. So she doesn't want to hear from me, you know, it's easier for me.\nYeah, that sucks. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nI mean, it's been the same recurring argument a lot and I wish that I could, sometimes I do, but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue. But the thing is, is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me. So I kind of just like lose it and I can't really like not say anything.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nWell, I guess the hardest decision I made, which I didn't only realize that it's the hardest decision, like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college, because for me, I basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. So it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time. It felt like just like a progression of the next step. But looking back now, that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made.\nOK. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nWell, I wish I could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral, which obviously it wouldn't change anything. But it wasn't seeing her there was not something I'd want to like have in my memory.\nThere's someone that's been a positive influence on you.\nShe was. She was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental. And now, I mean, my parents are great role models just in general. I mean, they're very successful people. So whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people, they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nUsually it's easy. The problem is staying asleep no matter how late I go to bed, whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m. I will be up like clockwork by 730 or 8 o'clock in the morning, the latest every single day. And I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer.\nAre you triggered by something?\nNo, I just in the morning, I guess I'm a lighter sleeper, but I just wake up like I just cannot stay asleep anymore, which never used to be a problem this consistent. But now it's I cannot remember the last time I slept past 830 in the morning.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well?\nI mean, it just makes if I have to do stuff during the day, it makes it a lot more tiring. But it doesn't really. I'm so used to it now. It doesn't really change my mood. It's just part of every day.\nOK. How have you been feeling lately?\nUm, I don't know. I kind of just feel very like so so just no extreme highs, no extreme lows. It's kind of one note land. I mean, nothing like lately. Um, like recently, it's just I would say over a period of years, I've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing.\nNo, I have been diagnosed with anxiety. I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital because I thought it was more serious because I couldn't breathe. But they said that it was a little bit more serious. So I had to go to the hospital. I think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it, if they're open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing. Then, yeah, no, I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid. I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me. But it was never so I mean, we just sat around and talked about my day. It wasn't I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time. So I didn't really get much out of it.\nWell, I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday. When I'm there, I can always just we save up our money. So it's a complete vacation. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. I just every morning we wake up, we just go to the doctor. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. So we wake up, we hang out, just enjoy the day.\nThat's great. Is there anything you regret?\nIn general?\nYeah. I regret the college I chose to go to. I didn't be from the East Coast. The whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently. The universities out there are not the same as the tight-knit California school system out here. So when I was researching colleges, I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general college, just like Boston College back home or any other school with the name college at the end of it. I didn't realize until the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school. I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went. So it kind of created more problems for me.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nWell, considering I'm 22, I'd probably say 10 years ago, I would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California.\nHow would your best friend describe you?\nMy best friend would describe me as a great, charismatic, funny, outgoing, socially enjoyable person, which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me, which I mean, I don't, I mean, it is what it is. I am very outgoing and have a great time when I'm with my friends in my element. But around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things, I just, I am very shy and don't really speak much.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nRecently, my friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago, and I really enjoyed that.\nNice. Yeah. What would you say are some of your best qualities?\nUm, I'm very caring. I am a very good judge of character, which I mean, I guess, I mean, I consider it to be a quality for myself. I'm very, I mean, not very affectionate. I'm more, I mean, I guess, I guess so.\nOkay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.\nThanks. I can chat with you a little bit more about.",
         "Okay, here is a summary of the interviewee's experiences with depression, written from the first-person perspective:\n\nLately, I've been feeling very \"so-so\" – no extreme highs or lows, just kind of one-note. Over the past few years, I’ve become more secluded and reserved. I was diagnosed with anxiety after experiencing some breathing problems and going to the hospital. While I believe therapy can be helpful in the right setting, my childhood experiences with it weren't beneficial. One of the happiest times I can remember recently was when I was at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday because I didn't have to worry about responsibilities. I also have trouble sleeping, waking up early no matter when I go to bed, but I'm used to it now and it doesn't really change my mood. ",

         "Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? So, how are you doing today?\nThat's good.\nWhere are you from originally?\nReally?\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nDo you travel a lot?\nI do. I go to school in Chicago. And I've been to New York a couple times. San Francisco. And I took a road trip across the country. That was cool. I saw a couple states.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nSeeing new places. Going to landmarks that I've only read about or seen pictures of.\nI'd love to hear about one of your trips.\nI traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66. And the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen, probably.\nAwesome. How did you feel in that moment?\nHappy. And then just happy. It was beautiful. It was nice. I haven't felt like that in a long time.\nWhat's your dream job?\nI love making movies. But part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera. So a comedian, a comedic actor would be totally great. But that's hard.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nI am super outgoing. And I love talking to people a lot. I like being the center of attention. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI like to watch mindless television. Like Toddlers and Tiaras and Duck Dynasty. I like to watch TV programs where I don't have to pay attention at all.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nI'm okay at it. I get really emotional really fast. But I'm usually able to keep my anger down and not lash out at others and stuff, for the most part.\nHas that gotten you in trouble?\nSometimes I get into arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily. And I hate apologizing to people, so the fights could last pretty long.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nMy best friend Ryan, I think. And it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and how we were going to go back to the way it was before.\nHow hard is that?\nReally hard. He's my best friend and I miss him. But we messed up and it's just not the same. It's like not the same friendship.\nI'm sorry.\nMe too.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nToo many. I guess... When I have a boyfriend and he's a girlfriend, which was not okay, I wish I would have just realized that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks, which led to my breakup and then our friendship being really messed up.\nCould you have done anything to avoid it?\nI guess not spend as much time with him as I did. Being more assertive.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nI guess... It was in November. I was very depressed and suicidal. So I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER. And from the ER I had the choice to, I don't know, I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital. And even though I felt like I didn't have a choice, I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital, which was like the worst experience of my life ever.\nCan you tell me about that?\nUm, it was awful. It was in Chicago and it was scary. I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices. There were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old. And it was scary. I didn't know anyone, everyone. Most of the people there weren't depressed, they were violent. So that was pretty scary and I just, it was really hard for me.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nI had been so depressed for like a month. I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work. I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turning in any work and I wasn't talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and I was just in a really bad place. And when I finally was going to kill myself, I realized I needed help. It was. I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time. So I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again. I just want to get better. So I had to do it. I had to get help.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful?\nI feel like if you have the right therapist, it's really useful. I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far, but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles. So I have to make do with this new therapist. She's okay. We're not that great together, but she's who I have right now. It's better than nothing.\nWhy?\nEver since I got out of the hospital and I began medication for my depression, I just haven't been able to sleep well. Falling asleep is hard. Staying asleep is hard. Have really crazy, vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing. I guess just sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about or happening in my life, but they're just they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom, like, did we go here? Did we do this? Did this really happen? And it's usually, no, you dream that. Sometimes I've gotten so scared. I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up. Probably like two nights ago.\nTell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nI guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends. Maybe going home with them and bake some cookies, eat all the cookies, watch some TV, have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies. We watch a lot of movies.\nI would like to do my free time.\nGo for a walk. I don't know. Go to the beach.\nIt was nice to meet you. Bye.",
         "Okay, so I've struggled with depression, especially recently. Last November, I was in a really bad place – skipping classes, failing school, isolating myself from friends, and drinking heavily. I was even suicidal. It got to the point where I knew I needed help and told a friend I needed to go to the ER. I chose to go to a mental hospital in Chicago, which was honestly the worst experience of my life. It was scary and isolating. I started medication after I got out, but now I have trouble sleeping and have really disturbing dreams. I had severe depression as a younger teenager and tried to kill myself then and got put in therapy for quite some time. I do think therapy can be helpful if you find the right therapist. I had one I really connected with, but she's back in Chicago. My current therapist is okay, but it's better than nothing.",

         "Okay. Yeah. Gotcha. Cool. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious about the people in the space and the way they're doing. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I love hearing about you. I'll ask you to get to the space first. And please feel free to come in and have a look at the answers to our questions and comments. Can you agree with this? Sure.\nSo, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. How are you?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? Chicago.\nReally? Yeah. When did you move to LA? About 25 years ago.\nOkay. Yeah, it's been a while. How often do you go back there? Actually, I haven't been back. I like LA.\nHow does it compare to LA? It's a big city, so it's kind of similar, but the weather is not the same. So, gotta love LA for the weather.\nI didn't know that. Why did you move to LA? Family. I was a child.\nHow was music for you that you used to live in LA? It took a little adjustment, but not hard.\nThat's good. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather... I can't think of anything right off the bat, but I sure wouldn't want to leave. My family is here, so that's another reason why I wouldn't want to leave.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really, but I've traveled a little bit, yeah.\nWhat are you enjoying about traveling? Seeing new places, different people, the way they live their lives. Cool. I'd love to hear about your friends. I went to Monterey, California, in the middle of last year. That was very nice.\nWhat's one thing you're most familiar with? That's a good question. I'm not really sure. I can't think of anything right off the bat, which makes me think it's kind of weird.\nWhat did you study at school? Astronomy.\nWas that a good student? How did you decide to do that? I don't know. I just kind of fell into it. I took a course, liked it, and then took some more, and kind of just went down that path.\nAre you still working on that? No.\nWhy? There's not much job opportunities, so it's kind of limited.\nDoes it help? Yeah, it does.\nWhat's your dream job? My dream job? I would like to own a restaurant, a nice bar restaurant.\nCan you tell me about that? I'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to. At least in the area that I live in, most places don't seem very, kind of just seem like a dive bar, or just kind of worn out, run down. Something nice, something different, something creative, something vibrant, something that attracts a crowd. But it's probably costly, so I don't know if it's really plausible.\nDo you consider yourself a shy or outgoing? I'm definitely more shy, but I can be outgoing when I'm comfortable with people, but initially I'm pretty shy.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fist and scream safer. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Good idea. What do you do to relax? A lot of times I try to just lay back and do some deep breathing, just kind of clear your mind. Or maybe just watch a movie. Listening to music is good. Reading a book kind of just takes your mind away. Relax.\nHow are you at completing things? I've gotten much better at it. I used to have problems with that when I was younger, but I'm good with that now. I've learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations. You should think before you speak, that type of thing.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? My ex-girlfriend, when we broke up about three months ago.\nCan you tell me about that? How did you feel when you broke up? How do you feel about a situation that makes you a different person?\nOkay, I think I've asked everything you need. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Have a good day. Goodbye. Hey, that was weird. I felt like I was in therapy. Should I take this off? Okay.",

I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I love learning about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to come in if you don't mind. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you OK with this? Yes.\nSo how are you doing today? I'm OK.\nWhere are you from originally? I was born in Mississippi.\nReally? Yes.\nWhen did you move to LA? When I was 2 and 1 half years old. But actually it wasn't in LA, it was Santa Monica.\nYou were very young working there. Yes.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown? Never.\nWhy? I was only 2 and 1 half years old. I don't remember anything.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? Oh, I like the beach. I love all the restaurants. The music scene. Just a general excitement. Oh, and the parks and all that.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic. The maintenance on the streets. All the potholes. The pollution.\nWhat did you study at school? Well, I studied a number of things at school. At one point I had majored in public relations, journalism, specialization in journalism. Then I also studied... I was a pre-law major. I studied the law. Then I also studied human services courses.\nThat sounds interesting. What made you decide to do that? Mainly because I'm a people person and I enjoy helping people.\nWhat's your dream job? I don't really have one right now.\nDo you travel a lot? No, I don't.\nWhat do you do to relax? Um, listen to music, watch horror movies. I love horror flicks. And I have a Fish Tank too, so I like to watch my fish. I also like to play tennis when I can. I haven't been able to play lately though because of physical problems.\nCan you tell me about that? Um, it's just that I had injured my ankle because I had anemia. And I got dizzy one night and I fell on my ankle and on my leg. So I'm just waiting for that to really heal. But I'm planning on getting back into tennis. It's one of the things I enjoy doing. It really relaxes me.\nHow are you at controlling your temper? I really don't have a temper. Over the years, I've learned how to control that.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? What were you about? Probably would have been yesterday, but there was no argument.\nAnd what was it about? Nothing. But I can recall.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about? Something I feel guilty about? There's nothing right now that I feel guilty about.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The absolute hardest decision that I ever had to make was when my, I have twins, twin boys, they're grown now. I had twins, twin teenagers, and I had lost my job and we were living in a motel. And the rent for the motel was outrageous. I couldn't no longer continue to pay the type of money that they wanted. So I had to briefly put my son in foster care for a minute. That was the hardest decision that I had to make.\nTell me about your kids. What was your first impression of your son? He was schizophrenic. And he had had, he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with speech therapists and school officials. And he also lost his hair when he was four years old. Um, but, and then when he turned 14, the schizophrenia came up. So right now he's in a supportive living environment. He's 27 years old. But he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now. I had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication and give him the medication and he'd hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever. So, but he's come to terms with that and we've all come to terms with that. He's doing, he's doing pretty good. That son, he's 27 too, as I said, because he's a twin, was living in Texas with his wife and he got a promotion to, so now he's in California too. Both are in California. I feel very good about that.\nDo you find it easy to be a parent? Um, well, of grown children, yes. No, I take that back. It's not hard to be a parent of my grown children. When they were younger, there were difficult times, and there were a lot of good times too, but yeah, there were some difficult times.\nCan you tell me more about that? Well, the difficult times I really pretty much already alluded to when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and they were in, temporarily in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia.\nWhat's the hardest thing about being a parent? At this point in my life, there's nothing hard about it.\nWhat's the best thing about being a parent? I don't know, I guess it's just to see something that you created develop into a pretty decent human being, a decent person. That's the best thing.\nWhat are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Oh, a lot of ways. I didn't have two parents. I had a mother and the father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I had no contact with him. But the thing that I do differently than what my mother did, she was a strong disciplinarian, both verbally and physically. Um, and she had this tendency, which she outgrew, to be very critical, opinionated, and very religious, and sort of looked at people who were not, and that was me, as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the Bible and all that kind of thing.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't get a good night's sleep or I don't sleep at all unless I take medication and that's all there is to it. If I don't take medication, I don't sleep. I'll be up all night. I will be up for days if I don't take medication.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? Man, irritable, and tired.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Lately, you know, just a little anxious really. I just recently made a move to a new apartment and it's a lot of expenses and new expenses and things like that, and new furniture and new this and that that you have to get. But I managed to do all that, but the whole thing was kind of stressful.\nDo you always pay off some of your art bills? Yes.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not PTSD.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Yes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed with that? That was back in, I think, 2004.\nWhat got you to see health? Because my life had gotten so stressful to the point where it was either I had to do something or end something, to tell you the truth.\nDo you still get a therapy now? Yes.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful? Yeah, I think it's useful as a good sounding board, someone to throw your concerns out and discuss things that might be bothering you. Well, good things too. Yeah, I think therapy with medication.\nWhat sort of changes have you noticed since you've been here? Since I've been going to therapy, a lot of changes, I've been more focused, more hopeful, it's just been a little bit of a struggle but it's just been a good experience for me which is why I continue to go.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy. Really happy? Well, I can feel really happy by some occurrence. I can't think of anything right now just like that and then I go back to how I was feeling. So I can't really pinpoint anything really. I mean, if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time, that makes me happy. If things go right, how about that?\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something I did recently that I really enjoyed. I can't think of anything.\nHow would your best friend describe you? I don't have a best friend.\nWhat would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities are that I'm an honest person. I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt. Everyone in my book is as they appear to be until they prove it differently. I'm very generous, overly generous. And I like to help other people. I mean, help on a personal level. I help people with anything, whatever their problem is, it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out.\nIs there anything you regret? Anything I regret? How so? Whatever comes to your mind? There's only one thing I regret, and that is that after my twins became old enough to start going to school, at the elementary school level, I was taking some courses as a pre-law major, and at that time I was married to their father who turned out not to be a good fit for me. And because of the stresses involved with him, knowing that that was going to end and I was going to leave him, I dropped out of college. So that was my biggest regret.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay in school, no matter what. Stay the course, no matter what.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life? That I'm a good person. That I'm a good human being. That's all.\nI think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye.\nAre you done? Okay. That was weird. I was a little nervous. Yeah? Well, we'll have you fill in a survey about your experience and then afterwards you may continue.",

I currently attend therapy, and I find it useful as a sounding board. I feel that therapy, along with medication, has been helpful. Since starting therapy, I've noticed changes in myself. I feel more focused and more hopeful, even though it's been a bit of a struggle. I also have trouble sleeping and need medication to get any rest.

         "All right. Great. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes, that's fine.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm okay. How are you?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally?\nOriginally, I'm from San Francisco.\nReally? When did you move to LA?\nOriginally, I moved here in, gosh, 1995. Then I went to Chicago, then to San Francisco, and then back to Los Angeles probably about five years ago.\nWow. A lot of moving. How often do you go back to your hometown?\nNever.\nWhy?\nThere just isn't anything there for me anymore.\nI understand. How does it compare to LA?\nThe weather is better in LA, but the people in San Francisco are nicer.\nYeah. Why is it different to LA?\nMy husband, my ex-husband, prefers it here. That's why we moved.\nOkay. What did you study at school?\nI have an undergraduate degree in psychology, and after that I went to law school.\nThat sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?\nWhen I was in college, I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer. It was really interesting. Are you still working at that?\nNo. Now I'm a stay-at-home mom. Tell me about your kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo. I love it, but it is difficult. You have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person. What's the hardest thing about being a parent?\nIt's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that. I'm good at that. The hardest thing, I think, is to guide them emotionally, to help him through things that he's having a hard time with, feeling like I don't have all the answers. What's the best thing about being a parent?\nJust seeing them grow and experience new things and learn about life and the world. It's really, really cool. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents?\nCompletely different. I am not a perfect parent, but I love my son. I take care of him. He's the first priority in my life, and they weren't like that at all. Tell me about your relationship with your family.\nWell, my parents are dead. I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died. I have a sister and a brother that actually, I don't know where they are. I don't speak to them either.\nOkay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nProbably more shy because I consider myself more reserved. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii. It's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI like to listen to music.\nLike what?\nI listen to all sorts of music, but my favorite when I'm relaxing is 80s music. Cheesy, cheesy, but true. How are you at controlling your temper?\nIt depends on who I'm with. If I'm with my son, I can control my temper. If I'm with my ex-husband or other adults, yeah, I don't. So-so. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nYesterday. It was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married. Can you tell me about that?\nUm, I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her. That sounds really hard.\nYeah. How did you feel in that moment?\nUm, really angry and just really hurt.\nYeah. I'm sorry. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nUm, I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died. I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nThe hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nBecause he was cheating on me. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nUm, that would have to be, well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today. So I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase.\nI see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nI don't get a good night's sleep. It's not easy. I wake up a lot in the night.\nWhy?\nI don't know. I wish I knew. If I knew, I could change it. I could try to do something about it, but I just don't, I don't know. What are you like when you don't sleep well?\nUm, grumpy, irritable. How have you been feeling lately?\nGrumpy, irritable, um, down, mixed with anger. Can you tell me about that?\nIt's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband. What do you have with them?\nUm, I just keep it inside. I mean, there's nothing else to really do except, I mean, it is what it is. So I have to deal with it. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nYes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nTen years ago after my son was born.\nWhat got you to see the health?\nNine years ago. I felt like I couldn't cope with life. I was so down. I couldn't, I felt like I couldn't do anything. Are you triggered by something?\nNo.\nDo you still go to therapy now?\nI don't go to therapy. I go to medication management. But I don't do talk therapy. Is going to a therapist helping you?\nI have gone to therapists and no, they don't help. Can you tell me about that?\nUm, well, some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything. If I wanted to talk to myself, I would. Others give advice that I think is just not good and not on point. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nIt was probably this morning I was playing with my son.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nJust really happy. I wasn't thinking about any of the other crap in my life. I could just forget it. So I was feeling really, really happy. How would your best friend describe you?\nI think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me. I think they would describe me as really sweet because they have really sweet, confident, outgoing, because that's what I try to be to people. So I think that's how they would describe me. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nI wish I wasn't sad. I wish I was more confident. Is there anything you regret?\nYeah, there are a lot of things, I think. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nIt would be to not give my life over to one particular person, which is what I did with my husband. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nI think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son, hanging around the pool, having fun, going out to dinner. Is there someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nTwo of my friends, two really good girlfriends, I think have been really positive influences in my life. Can you tell me about that?\nHer life is worse than mine, but we can always commiserate together. She's just really positive. She's always happy, always up, always looking to the bright side. That's so good to hear. What are you most proud of in your life? Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nI went over to a friend's house and we had movie night. We watched a grown-up movie and had dinner and wine. The boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games. It was just a relaxed, fun evening. That sounds like a great situation. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nSure. Bye.",
         "Okay, here's my story regarding my experiences with depression:\n\nI was diagnosed with depression about ten years ago, a year after my son was born. I sought help because I felt like I couldn't cope with life; I was so down and felt incapable of doing anything. I don't go to talk therapy anymore because I haven't found it helpful. Some therapists just sit there silently, and others give advice that I don't find useful. I am on medication management though. Lately, I've been feeling grumpy, irritable, down, and angry, mainly because of everything I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband. I wish I wasn't sad, and I wish I was more confident. I also don’t sleep well and wake up a lot during the night, which makes me even grumpier.",

         "Okay. Yes. I'm alright. South LA. The weather. The women. The opportunities. That's about it. Racism. Police brutality. Injustice. That's it. No. Not much of a exploring type of person. Psychology. It was one of the classes I excelled in the most. So I decided to change it from business to psychology. Yeah, yes. No. It's on my own record label. How hard is that? Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? Why? I'm not. What do you do to relax? Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best it's got. That's good. How are you at controlling your hunger? I think I'm pretty decent now compared to how I used to be. Is that something you're controlling? Yes, ma'am. Can you tell me about that? Due to the lack of, I guess you could say, controlling my emotions, I have got incarcerated and sent to prison. Yeah. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made to make. I'm not sure. I don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision I've ever made in my life. When was the last time you argued with someone and argued it out? It was probably a few days ago with the girl I was talking to and I was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness. How did you feel around her? Frustrated. Because you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship. And at the same time when you have expectations, sometimes you kind of set yourself up for failure. I guess I'm just learning. Tell me about a situation that you would have handled differently. There are a lot of situations I would have handled differently. Probably the most recent was I got into a physical altercation with an inmate when I was incarcerated. And that's what sent me to prison and I had to do a lot more time. And if I handled it differently, I probably would have never went to prison. I probably would have been home a lot sooner than what originally happened. Tell me about events or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. There are several events I wish I could erase from my memory. Probably my first girlfriend. She did something really extreme. It wasn't necessary in my eyes. And it could have cost me my life. I think that's a recurring thought that I wish I could completely erase my memory, along with the good memories as well. A few fights. I guess you could say shootouts. Getting jumped, getting robbed. Those things I think those inhibit me, I guess, to explore certain areas of life that I'm not comfortable with. So those are the few things that would be nice if I could erase it completely. What's something you feel guilty about? Hurting people I didn't need to be hurt emotionally, especially a few women in my life or in my past. Probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through, along with my close friends and family as well. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It used to be rocky growing up. But as I got older and matured and the certain experiences that I've been through kind of brought me closer to my family. So now it's pretty decent. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? My mother. Can you tell me about that? She had her share of experiences, negative and positive. I admire her. The struggles she's been through. She experienced difficult economic hardships growing up, but that didn't stop her from raising a son at a young age, finishing school, getting her masters, and just overall being a good person. And she also battled mental health issues as well. Okay, I think I've asked everything you need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. You can have a look at your computer. We'll finish up with a post survey about your experience.",
         "Okay, so, looking back on things, I think a big part of my struggles comes from not being able to control my emotions. It led to me getting incarcerated and doing time in prison. There are definitely things I wish I could erase from my memory, like what happened with my first girlfriend – it was a really bad situation that could have cost me my life. Also, some of the fights and violence I've been through still affect me; they make me afraid to explore new things. I also feel guilty about hurting people emotionally, especially women in my past, and putting my mom through tough times. But, you know, my mom has been a huge positive influence. She went through so much, including her own battles with mental health, and still managed to raise me and build a good life.",

         "Okay, that looks good.\n\nShe'll let you know when you guys are done.\n\nOkay. Yeah, sure. I'm good. How are you? I'm from Florida originally. Where are you from? For work. How long have you been back to Florida? I haven't been back in a few months. How did you get into Florida? It was pretty easy. It's not that much of a difference except I guess the buildings are bigger. What do you like about Florida? I like the weather and I like the environment of Hollywood, I guess. What do you hate about the city? I hate the transportation system and the traffic, it's really bad. I'm sure you can tell from the screen, you're not missing the road. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, I've traveled a lot around America. What do you like about America? I like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff. I guess it's just relaxing and it's fun. What was your favorite place to visit? I went to Canada once. My mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there. I didn't like the cold. What was your favorite food? What did you like about that particular trip? She made us this Canadian food called poutine or something. That was a new experience. Sometimes when I'm doing something, I come up with a new experience. Hey, sometimes not a lot, but it's a precious time. What do you do when you're relaxing? I try to get out in the sun and go to the beach or something or read a book. I'm pretty okay. It depends on how bad the situation is. Two days ago, I was arguing with my sister about something. What was your favorite thing to do? I don't know. I guess think more before I talk and maybe I won't lose my temper. What was your favorite thing to do? Something I wish I could erase from my memory. I guess negative people that I've met before. I guess I just want to erase the thought of meeting them. What was your hardest decision? The hardest decision I've had to make. I don't know. I guess what I wanted to study in college maybe. It's not that hard, but it's a big decision. What did you study? Computer science. Are you still working on it? Yeah, a little bit. Not as much, but a little bit. How did you get into it? I got into it when I was a teenager. I was good at it. I figured I'd go on studying at a higher level. Are you still working on it? Yeah, somewhat. I was trying to make a decision between that and the arts. I'm just happy I did it though. What did you dream about? A dream job? A fashion designer. How hard is it? How hard is the job? I don't think it's a hard job. I like clothes and fabric and making clothes like that. I don't think it's a hard job. How do you sleep? I fall asleep within five minutes, depending on how tired I am. What do you do when you're tired? I'm very irritable. I'm very irritable and not good to be around when I'm tired. And I can't focus. How do you feel about your job? I've been feeling good. Fine. Have you ever been in a relationship? No. How did you get the last time you felt really happy? The last time I felt really happy... I guess like a week or so ago I went to... I went to... There we go. I went to this event downtown. It was like an art walk thing, so it was exciting. Awesome. Thanks. What do you think about your job? I think I'm a good friend. I think I'm hardworking. And... what else? Yeah, that's it. Do you regret anything? Um... Do you think I regret? Not really. Well yeah, I regret not contacting old friends that I knew. So I guess maybe I'll do that in the future. How do you know them? I know them from elementary school. But we lost contact through the years. Because I switched schools. How do you guys spend your time? Really badly, you know? Um... I can't think of it. I guess I was in... I was in an elevator one time and this person was running towards it. And I was trying to hold it for them, but I couldn't reach in time and they started cursing me out. So I felt really bad because they probably thought I didn't try to open it for them. But yeah. It was sad. How do you guys spend your time? For now? Okay. Um... I don't know, I guess I would just say... Um... Learn as much as I can and... I don't know, just don't hold back so much. With like um... Like not being outgoing and stuff, I guess I just tell myself to be more outgoing. How do you guys spend your time? Um... I think they'd say the same thing I said earlier. That I'm generous, patient, hardworking, and... What else did I say? Um... Kind? I hope they'd say that. How do you feel about being an intellectual? Um... I am proud of my intelligence. Okay. Okay, bye. Take care. Bye. That was weird.",

         "Hi, how are you?\nI'm good, how are you?\n\nAre you a gamer?\nYeah.\n\nI'm from Los Angeles. Probably the downtown, the view. And it's not that I like it, but that's just where my parents were, so that's where I grew up. Nothing, that's right there, I love LA. Maybe that is ghetto, but that's about it. I was thinking of going for sound engineer or mechanic, but I'm not sure. Because my dad, he used to do that. I'm not even sure to be honest. I really thought about it.\n\nI can look at your shoes.\nNah, I don't travel like that. I don't know, maybe money issue or something. I have a lot of money, I go all over the world.\n\nProbably outgoing. Depends I guess. About what? Shy or outgoing? Outgoing, you could be outgoing at a party, you know. You're already out there, so you can be shy if you're going to a party.\n\nI'm good. Probably my girlfriend, because I miss work, because I just feel lazy. I was like, whatever, I just didn't want to go and I do what I want. I just didn't go.\n\nNah, not really. She's already there. As long as we have the bills and rent paid. Don't worry.\n\nGuilty. Probably nothing. I'm not sure if I'm going to work. Damn, I get raised from that. Probably bad friends that I've met. Friends that trick you, that just trick you. Friends that deceive you, I guess. Okay, like my friend told me that he had a good job at some car wash place. So he told me to, he's going to get me hired there and get me a direct deposit. But then he ended up actually going into my account and taking money from my account. So...\n\nProbably moving out and into my mom's house. Yeah, I haven't really been around, man. Like a big decision like that. I want my own space, my own life. I want to do what I want. Come home when I want, leave when I want. Yeah. And we're all close. We hardly argue. We're always around. We always see each other. My mom, my dad, my brother.\n\nHow they were positive in my life?\nWell, they're always there for you. Whether you have financial problems, they're there. They help you out. Whether you're sad, they know it and they blame what's wrong. They're always there to motivate you and keep you going.\n\nHow easy was it to move out?\nEasy. Actually, yeah, pretty easy.\n\nWhen did you learn about the U.S.?\nI'm sorry?\n\nWhen did you learn about the U.S.?\nI haven't noticed, but maybe... Probably the same. I don't think sleep does affect you, but I don't know. Maybe more tired, but I don't think annoyed or mad or anything like that.\n\nHow do you feel about the U.S.?\nGood. Everything's great. Maybe that I want to start a new business or something.\n\nDo you have a new business?\nWell, like my dad, he wasn't around for a while, but he just got back. He actually opened up a shop and he's getting a lot of customers. So it seems that his business is growing, so I'm probably going to learn mechanics, like I was saying earlier. That's cool.\n\nHave you ever been by the pool?\nI don't even know what it is.\n\nHave you been by the pool?\nNo.\n\nHave you played games?\nNope.\n\nHow do you love your basketball?\nI'm sorry?\n\nHow do you love your basketball?\nYesterday, last night, because I got a new game. Awesome.\n\nWhat do you say when you hear a comment?\nThat not funny?\n\nDo you have a new girlfriend?\nNo.\n\nWhat are some things you would like to change about your life?\nI don't think nothing. Everything's fine, you know. Thank God everything's good right now. I don't think there's nothing to change like that.\n\nWhat kind of job?\nMaybe a better job. Well, first of all, I don't even have a job. So I guess to change I'll get a job. It's hard for someone to put me down like that.\n\nDo you see a part of that I'm responsible as well?\nI don't know.\n\nShe was components of 20 years ago when I gave that one almost nine years, because she was having hard time paying bills and rents. So I, I'm proud that I was able to help her even though I could only give so little.

         "Okay. Here's the cleaned transcript:\n\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just creative to talk to people and think into their environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started, and please feel free to comment on anything. Your answers are very important. Are you okay with this?\nYes, I am.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing very good today.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nI'm originally from Chicago, Illinois. Moved out here when I was three.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI never go back.\nWhy?\nFamily issues. I see. How does it compare to LA life?\nIt depends on what you're into. If you're into the fast life in Hollywood, it doesn't compare at all. If you're into the cold weather, then you would rather be out there. I like the sun.\nMm-hmm. What's the difference?\nMy mom and my dad split up.\nI'm sorry.\nIt's okay. How easy was it for you to move to the US?\nI have no idea. I was only three when I moved out here.\nOkay. What are some things you really like about LA?\nI like the sunshine. I like the weather. I like the balance of the weather we have in the spring, winter, fall, and the summer. I like the beaches. I like Hollywood. I like that the Lakers are here. I love the people. It's a different variety. I think LA is a microcosm of the United States. People from all over the world come to the United States and people from all over the country and all over the world. They come to LA for a better opportunity. That's what I like about LA.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nGang violence.\nHi, Mr. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nNo, not really. I've traveled one time to Arizona and one time to Stockton, California, and another time to Barstow, California, but I don't do much traveling right now, mainly because of finances.\nWhat did you study at school?\nI studied alcohol and drug counseling.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nI just felt it in my heart that that's what I was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions. That was a kind of easy choice. I got some advice from people and I just went into it to do it just to see what it was. I finished school and did an internship and got hired. I believe that's what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.\nAre you still working on that?\nI'm not working right now. I actually moved away and I was married and we had to move away. We moved away because renting was cheaper, so I actually had to give up that job in order to make that move. Since I came back down, I've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so I can get back into counseling.\nHow hard is that?\nIt can be very difficult at times because I have a felony. I can't work with the youth and I can't work with the elderly, but the regular adults, I can. Then you have to be certified and I'm not certified yet. You have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified. Before they even allow you to take the test, you have to work a certain amount of hours. Right now I'm just trying to get into interns, try to intern and show people what I can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume. They just want people to be certified. Not being certified, the experience and the fact that I have a felony makes it hard.\nWhat's your dream job?\nMy dream job is to open my own facility or as an author.\nDo you consider yourself a shy or a felon?\nThat depends on people. I mainly adapt my personality to the people that I'm around. If people are perky, then I'm going to be perky. If they're standoffish, then I may seem shy, but I'm not shy. I'm just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up. If people open up right away, then I open up right away. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's a trusted guy.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI mainly listen to music or I watch YouTube, write poetry, or just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like I can sing, which I can't. Another thing I do is I eat ice cream.\nTell me about controlling your temper.\nControlling my temper, I'm very, very good at it. It depends on what it is. I have to say that the last time I lost my temper was because I felt like somebody was scaring my mother. I lost my temper, but 99 times out of 100, I don't lose my temper. I don't like to raise my voice. I just like to be calm and cool. I like everybody to be comfortable. I don't want anybody to be frightened or anything. There's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it. I just believe that, and I believe angry outbursts to be a link to heart problems and high blood pressure. I definitely don't want that.\nTell me about a situation that you were seeing in a different way.\nWell, I was just telling you about, it was my mother's husband. To tell you the truth, I could have handled that differently, but when I seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear, I just lost it. I snapped. I told my mother, I don't like this. You need to take care of this because I don't know how long I can keep my composure as far as this. I've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother, but that's her husband. I kept my distance in their relationship, but when I saw her having fear in her eyes, that triggered a part of me that I don't like very much because I know if I get angry, I usually stay angry for a long time. So I should have just left. I should have just left and went home and rested and got up in the next morning and went to church. But yeah, we had a big time explosion and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months. So yeah, those six to nine months, I can't get back. That's very hard.\nYes. Tell me about your relationship with your family.\nWell, my brother's in prison. I haven't seen him in 20 years. He's been there 20 years. My sister moved to Chicago 13 years ago. I haven't seen her since then. So I'm only close to my mother. And my son, I haven't seen him in five years and I'm still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and how that's going to turn out for me. I just, you know, I have a small family and I have family in Chicago, but I don't mess around with that side of the family just because of what I've seen and heard. So I just don't want it to happen to me at all. So I just keep my distance.\nIs there someone who's been a positive influence in your life?\nSomeone who's been a positive influence in my life, I would say... Taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me expressing my emotions, being threatening to someone else. And taught me how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are. And when they're really strong, that's when I just need to be quiet until that intense fizzling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not just emotionally. And of course, he's he was the one that told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor. My father, he's got 27 years clean and sober right now. He used to live on Skid Row and the way he changed his life around and, you know, the way he approached me as a father was just something that I'll never forget.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about?\nFeel guilty about? My grandfather. He passed away in 2004 and at that time I was just getting out of prison. 2002 I was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't going to be around for that much longer. But I didn't get it because I had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that I considered to be more important than that. Plus the fact I didn't understand him, what he was saying. But when he died, I figured out that he was telling me that I should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go. But I couldn't see it then. And I feel I think about it all the time.\nOkay. Tell me about home or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nSomething I could erase from my memory? What made a day my brother hit my mom? I always replay that over and over in my mind. And it's like that's one memory I can just go without replaying my mind over and over again. So yeah, that memory right there.\nHow did you feel about that memory?\nI felt conflicting feelings. Because on one hand, my brother was protecting me from getting beat. And on the other hand, he was hitting my mom. So it's kind of in the middle.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nMost nights I don't. I go to sleep maybe three in the morning. And I'm probably I'm more than likely up at seven in the morning. So I don't get much sleep. It depends on the environment I'm in. If I don't sleep well. I'm going eventually I'm going to be irritable, but it doesn't happen right away. It depends on my environment and who's around me. If they're difficult people, that's going to be a challenge for me. And if people are easy going, no one will even know that I didn't get much sleep.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI've just been feeling like that things are about to start going better for me. Making some better decisions. Taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me. Taking advantage of my talents. Taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me. So I'm very enthusiastic about that. Even if it doesn't happen, I'll send out a million resumes. I don't care if I get five interviews. I will never stop because I know that being a counselor is my life mission. And I'm also destined to be a writer. And it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people know about me because I've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that. And I have a lot to offer humanity. So it's just a matter of time before that the public is exposed to what I've been gathering.\nHow do you understand that you're using your behavior in front of people?\nMy behavior? I'm more mellow. I laugh more. I'm more humorous. I let a lot of things go that I used to just let tick me off and anger me. And things that I can't control, like trying to control people or trying to make sure people don't betray me. And you just can't control that. I matured mentally and psychologically. And the acquisition of a sense of humor was a major, major breakthrough for me. So I know my thoughts have changed. And with my thoughts changing, my behavior has changed. I still have to monitor it. My thoughts and my behavior, I still have to monitor them. But overall, back then I just tolerated myself. Now I actually like myself. And it will behoo you to feel the same way.\nOkay. Have you ever been diagnosed with dysplasia?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nLast time I felt happy was last night because the Lakers won the basketball game.\nAwesome. How do your best friends describe you?\nMy best friend would describe me, he calls me the truth.\nWhy?\nBecause I always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and I always reveal it. They can't hide it from me. I have a statement that says I see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it. And I see stuff days and months before they start happening. I know human behavior when I see it and I sniff it out real well. And it's just a gift that was given to me. So he calls me the truth because of how I interact with people and how people have to come clean with me. Because when they look at me, they know that I see through them. Like I said, like a clear glass with nothing in it. And yes, that's why he calls me the truth.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nI wish I would have never, well, obviously I wish I would have never went to prison. I wish that I could change, well, my economic status, my employment status, and my teeth. That's like a problem area for me. I did a lot of stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and I didn't take care of my teeth. And now that I need to be confident about myself as I can be, it always comes up every now and then, the thought, like, I wonder if they're looking at my teeth. I wonder if they're looking at my teeth. I never get the impression that they are, but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says, are they looking at my teeth? So I would really change that. And I would change my physical size. I think I would like to be at least 35 pounds heavier, but I'm working on it. 20 years ago, which would make me 18, I would have, at that time I was a big time high school basketball player for Freedman High School and I had colleges coming to see me and I would have given myself the opportunity to stay away from the troublemakers because I didn't and I blew my opportunity to play college basketball for Duke Blue Devils and who knows, I could have been playing for the Lakers last night. But, hey.\nI'm most proud of what?\nI'm most proud of my mom. Really. She graduated from school. She had a full-time job. She would wake up at 5 in the morning, go to work, get off her job at 3.30, go straight to the college, leave the college at 9 o'clock at night. She does this five days a week and still had the strength to maintain. She was on the Dean's List and the President's List, so doing all of this, you know, when they say that older people can't do things, I just think that dispels that rumor. And she recently got her license as an evangelist in the church, so I'm just real proud of that. Her life has been affecting people in a positive way. So, yeah, my mom.\nOkay, thank you. Goodbye. Okay, thank you.",
         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I often struggle to get a good night's sleep, usually going to bed around 3 AM and waking up at 7 AM. This lack of sleep can make me irritable, especially if I'm in a difficult environment. I also have a memory of my brother hitting my mom that replays in my mind often, and it brings up conflicting feelings. I wish I could erase it.",

         "Okay, that looks good. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing fine.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nMexico.\nReally? When did you move to LA?\nWhen I was young, seven years old.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI've been there like three or four times for vacation.\nHow does it compare to LA?\nWell, it's less stressful. I don't know if it's because I'm on vacation, but I feel more at peace over there than here.\nWhy did you move to LA?\nWell, my family moved down here for a better life. That was my parents.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nJust the weather and different things that you could do. You could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains. Different variety of things to do.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic. Yeah, basically the traffic. That's one of the main things.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nNot that much. I've been to New York and Mexico only.\nCool. What do you enjoy about traveling?\nJust seeing new places and finding new locations. Something new.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? Like for a trip?\nYeah. Well, I've been to Mexico. I've been to the pyramids of what I forgot to call Mexico City. I like finding out about my ancient culture since I'm Mexican. From my genetics, I like to see different things like that.\nThat's great. What did you study at school?\nWell, at school, I did dropout but I came back and I'm trying to get back into it right now. I'm trying to learn graphic design.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nWell, I started liking to take pictures, doing different things. I like going into business. I like what the title is about.\nWhat's your dream job?\nI want to have my own business. Either making web pages, just be able to be free and don't be relying on someone else. Just be able to have freedom for myself.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nOutgoing.\nWhy?\nI just like to be around people, like to get to know people, depending on the person and how I feel around them.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI like to hear music or do different things like play sports or do different things just to unwind.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nWell, I'm getting better at it.\nWhat was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about?\nWell, it was like two days ago. It was something about I needed to pay a bill or something that I had taken care of. But the person, he's more picky about it. He knows how girls are. They want everything right there and then. I have a handle. I have everything there. And they're just bugging. Sometimes they don't give you the space that you need to resolve something.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nWell, I felt like I was overwhelmed. I already had it resolved. I just was waiting for a check. It's not on my control, but I already had made the proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it. It's like you're making an argument, a storm in a glass of water.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nWell, differently, there's a couple of them, but not so recently because I've been more trying to get my life together. But the decisions I made before in the past, I dropped out of school and doing other different things.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about?\nGuilty? Not that much because not really. Not that I can think right off the top of my head.\nOkay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nThe hardest decision? It's just not on top of my head right now.\nOkay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nAn event? Well, the only things that I remember is when I blacked out or different things like that that I don't remember. But nothing like a particular, only when my brothers died and different things like that.\nCan you tell me about that?\nWell, my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble. And it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much, get into it.\nOkay. Tell me about your relationship with your family.\nNo, I'm Hispanic. I like to be with my family. And I like to go over there to Mexico too. I have a half sister and my grandpa died. He was over there in Mexico. So I like to have a good relationship with my family.\nThat's good. Who's son of it's been a positive influence in your life?\nWell, my mom and dad, they always work hard. They always done what they have to do to pay the bills. That's why sometimes I'd be like, you know, running around trying to get everything done, but done correctly, not trying to take the easy way out.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's a little hard because they're, especially here in Los Angeles, there's a lot of different things that you could get into that's not that positive. And it's hard to stay focused on, you know, the correct stuff.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nWell, normally I just knock out. It's not that hard. It's like, it takes me like half an hour or 15 minutes. But sometimes I can't even wake up even with the alarm. They have to wake me up. You know, my girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on. It's like so hard. You know, I just knock out.\nWhat are you like when you're dusting off?\nI do get a little, either I'm angry or I don't feel good and I don't feel with energy. But I still have to know, I know I have to do something, so I still go through with it.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI've been, well, I've been feeling good, you know, doing a little restless, but not that much. I have to do stuff, so I just, you know, put myself to do it no matter how I feel.\nHave you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?\nNo, nothing out of the ordinary.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nThe last time I felt happy, that was probably on the weekend that I was, you know, going out with, going out to have some fun and, you know, I was drinking and just relaxing and winding down.\nAwesome. Mm-hmm. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nMy ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home, just relax. But nothing else, you know, just be able to relax and unwind with her, you know, either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home, but without getting any calls or any interruptions. You know, just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything and just be with her doing other different things.\nYeah. Mm-hmm. How are your best friends around you?\nLike an outgoing guy, you know, very social, but at the same time I'm reserved depending how I feel with people. I have to, you know, build trust or feel comfortable with them.\nUh-huh. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nWell, I'm changing a lot, you know, like my temper and different things, drinking things. I'm changing a lot of different things so I could get more different things done.\nTell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself.\nWell, there's several, but mostly is when I'm coming from Mexico that they want to demean you even down there. It feels like silly because I went to a store, I was regularly dressed, and I was telling them I wanted to buy something, and then they said that I wasn't belong there. And as soon as they saw my credit card, they kind of changed perspective because they saw the Wells Fargo logo, they know it was American. But they thought it was like, you know, it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place, you have the money, you ask for something, you can ask for something because you have it, not just to kill their time. Just because they saw a logo of a card, that's how they, you know, it just, it was ridiculous for me.\nI understand. Is there anything you regret?\nNo.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nBasically, to stay more focused on different things, stay in school, and, you know, don't go, you know, try to control my temper and do different things. Because if I knew what I know now, back then, it would be different.\nHmm. What are you most proud of in your life?\nWell, I did drop out, but I did go back to school and, you know, I did get my high school. And right now I'm in the process of doing other different things. So right now it's getting my high school, getting that together. And right now I'm working to another goal and trying to get, you know, my, either going back to school. So basically getting back to school and finishing the high school, the GED.\nThat's so good to hear. Mm-hmm. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nOkay. You're welcome. Bye.\nOkay. Stop the recordings.\nMm-hmm. I feel like that works like I thought it would.",
         "Okay, here’s a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nI haven't been diagnosed with depression. When asked, I said I have not been diagnosed with depression. I've been feeling good lately, though a little restless, but I push myself to do things anyway. I don’t think I’ve experienced any changes in my behavior or thoughts lately. I do get angry or feel bad and without energy when I don't get enough sleep, but I still push myself to do what I need to do. The last time I felt really happy was on the weekend when I went out to have fun, drink, relax and unwind.",

         "Okay. So once again, when she says that, I'm going to go ahead.\n...for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue to provide for them comfortably.\nWhat did you study at school?\nI studied communications actually. I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now I'm studying business.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nI just thought that you know there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs and then I have a desire to go to graduate school so I just figured in the long run it would put me in a better position, give me more opportunities with the communications. It's a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of TV reporting and things like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so I just thought I would go into something more realistic and you know but I like both fields. I really do. I like communicating, writing, reading, talking as you can tell and so we'll see.\nWhat's your dream job?\nA couple probably but I would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer, going to different destinations, trying different foods out, writing about different people, cultures, learning and living you know about those different people and cultures living amongst the people there and being interactive with the children and stuff like that so I kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor, social worker, something in that area. If I could encompass all three hopefully I can. I would like to do that.\nThat's actually a hard question probably because I initially grew up very shy and I'm not so much shy as I am reserved now but not conservative but just reserved and you know when I go somewhere I'm checking everything, everybody else out and then once I become comfortable or acclimate to a situation then I'm like okay you know I warm up to the situation or the people but I'm also friendly. I can be very friendly and outgoing. I like to talk. You know I seem like a chatterbox but I'm not really so usually if I'm in a big space with a whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention. I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but overall I am an open friendly person.\nFor me it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything, all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating, praying or reading a good spiritual scripture. If I'm able to I like to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, you know things that will I kind of like the physical part of it. I like massages, things that really release tension. And if not then just like I said just sitting at home reading and praying or I like the beach. I love the beach so sometimes I drive and go sit by the beach. I also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani-pedi or maybe go window shopping. You know things like that.\nPretty good. Sometimes I'm just like I don't really have so much issue with the temper as I am. I just I'm more impatient. Unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so I just can become really irritated or irritable, quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me and just lose patience. Outside of that I'm actually pretty good. I try to be very conscious of where I'm at and be very patient with people especially if I can see that the person is like if they're a new checkout person at the counter or cashier I do try to be patient and understanding because I would want that you know if it were me I would want someone to extend that to me. You know with my kids sometimes you know it works both ways too. If it's that time of the month I'm just like just leave me alone or I might have a short temper or a short fuse. So I am conscious of it. I try to be aware of it and try to monitor it but you know like anybody I'm human in their times or I have my days or moments when I could just like go off and just lose it.\nWhat was the last time you argued with someone?\nUm well I haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been an ongoing thing with American Express. So I would say because it was not a personal contact but a company I we it really was an argument but you know I had some issues with American Express I had to call in about on I think Saturday and I kept I wasn't getting the response I expected and so I would the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and I was upset and you know the rep was trying to over talk me and then I was trying to over talk her. So you know I don't know if you would consider that an argument but I would definitely say that's the last time when you know I just kind of like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning. That one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nProbably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express. Actually it was on Sunday. Yeah and I know the person was trying to help me but you know when you're constantly being told different things and I've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved. It just takes you there. So just I kept raising my voice said some things I shouldn't have and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact. I like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there. My blood pressure was raised. Excuse me. And that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that. Just irritable and agitated and upset. And so I always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how I could you know handle things differently. But that's one I definitely wish I could have kept my cool and been more level headed and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite.\nOkay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nHmm. Well I probably have had a couple but probably the most is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and I was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time. And he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time. And I wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby. But he put me under so much stress and you know kind of I want to say really pushed me into having terminating the pregnancy. And that's always stayed with me and I've always missed that pregnancy that child I think about that that baby or what could have been. I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it. But I know deep down I secretly if I had it to do all over again I would have just I would have kept the baby and move forward. So that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally. I could deal with a lot and I have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know a lot of financial problems. But that to me was the hardest.\nThank you.\nNo. No.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nOkay you know I was laid off in December so I've been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet. So that's been a little tough. I've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school. So my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place about five years ago. Well she's been able to move forward and going with her life and now she's graduating in next month from USC with her master's in social work. So I'm feeling a little envious of that and I have been for like the past year but more so recently although I'm very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it. But you know of course you've done a lot of what she was me so that too has kind of been bothering me. Hi Ms. Lola.\nWhat would you say are some of your best qualities?\nWell I'm really good with people. I communicate well. I like to talk. I'm really good with children. That's why I would like to teach or be a counselor. Although I have not really tapped into it I know I'm a very creative person. I know I write pretty good. I could possibly be a creative writer but I know I'm very creative. So if given the opportunity I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills. Something like with maybe songwriting, fiction writing, probably like interior decorating. Anything artistic. Just anything because I love music. I love the arts. I love drama. I love plays. I'm not a big fashion buff but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that. So I think those are my strong points as well as just getting along with people. I know I will make a great counselor. My friends come to me all the time. I have a good ear for listening. I'm a great mediator and I know how to because I've been through a lot. One of my friends called me the voice of reason. The one that's actually graduating from SC. I know I'm light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom. I don't know if it has to do with having older parents myself or how I grew up. I had very traditional southern parents who instilled a lot of great values in me. Or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign, I'm a Pisces. I'm really good with people. Just period. Like I said, I have my moments but I know if it's something I could go into and develop, I would do well.\nIs there anything you regret?\nNot really. Some of the situations. I wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children. Picked a different partner. I say that because my son's father is great. A great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me. We're not together. I'm just saying overall. I think I would say, if I could let me backtrack that, not finishing school when I should have. Not following my dreams and goals and doing things as I was planning initially. I think that would be the one thing I could say I regret. Not following my goals and finishing school on time and pursuing what I really wanted to do.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nStay focused and finish school. Pick a career path and stay on that. Stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nI think I'm pretty stable and consistent. Overall, how I face adversity. How I face things. I'm a pretty committed person. If I say I'm going to do something, I try to stick to it. I'm a very loyal friend. I've done a pretty good job with raising my kids.\nSo long. Great. Thank you. Bye bye.",
         "Looking back, there have been periods where I really struggled. After being laid off, facing child support issues, and trying to juggle school and job hunting, my emotions were all over the place. I felt envious of a friend who was graduating with her Master's, knowing I wanted to be where she was. The hardest decision I ever made was years ago, when I was pressured into terminating a pregnancy. That has always stayed with me, and I still think about that child. While I've faced a lot of challenges, that remains the most emotionally difficult thing I've gone through.",

         "Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get it started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm wonderful. How are you?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally?\nCalifornia.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nThe weather is one of them. The food and the way everything is centrally located.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic, the smog, and it's just gotten really overcrowded.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nI wouldn't say a lot, but I do try to travel at least once or twice every two years.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nJust exploring different things and being able to have different experiences, things of that nature, and learning new things and just different cultures. I like to learn about different cultures, and when you travel, you get a sense of feedback from different cultures and different areas. So I like that. I'd love to hear about your trips.\nI just came from Miami last year. I went to Miami for a week and a half. It was really nice. The weather was great. It was my first time going. The weather was wonderful. The people were really nice. It was really a great experience. I went out there for a particular event. They have something every year where everyone comes out from all over. You just kind of party and hang out and meet new people. It was really fun.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nFrom that trip, I would say swimming in the beautiful Miami beach waters. It was wonderful.\nThat sounds like a great situation.\nYeah, it was.\nWhat did you study at school?\nChild development.\nThat sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?\nWell, I've always been interested in children since I was younger. I babysat a lot, so I had a lot of experience with kids at a young age. As I grew older, I realized that it was something that I liked to do. That's when I looked into child development courses. I thought that it was something that I would enjoy doing. I started taking classes, and the rest is history.\nAre you still working on that?\nI am, yes. It's been 15 years in August.\nWow. What's your dream job?\nMy dream job? I would say to become a principal.\nWhy?\nWell, it's something that I've thought about doing for a while now. I've actually just began the steps to try to get that going. I'm going to be back in school, and I'm going to be taking courses so that I can make that happen, because it is a dream of mine.\nThank you. How hard is that?\nIt's going to be pretty difficult. There is several years of schooling that I have ahead of me. It's definitely going to be a challenge, but it's something that I'm up for because it is a dream job of mine. It's something that I'm willing to do.\nI understand. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nA little bit of both, I think. I can be shy at times, and outgoing as well.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI meditate. I'm a big meditator, so I love meditating. I love reading and having a nice, quiet, peaceful time.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nOh, wow. I'm very good at that. Again, a series of meditations that I do, it involves deep breathing and just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heartbeat, and you can really feel everything in your body.\nThat's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nIt's about just the way he responds sometimes to me. It can be a little aggressive. We're just trying to work with that because I don't respond well to aggression. I totally tune out, and that's actually what happened. Yeah, that was it.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nI felt very frustrated, and I actually felt angered too, but more frustrated. I felt saddened too because I don't like arguing, so it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nA situation which I wish I would have handled differently. Honestly, I haven't had a situation like that in years. I've pretty much mastered my responses to certain stimuli. I've got that down.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nThe hardest decision I've ever had to make? Well, it was when I was 16 years old, and I became a teenage mother. I was pregnant at 16, and I had a lot of pressure from family to give my child up for adoption or to abort. I chose life, so that was one of the hardest decisions, if not the hardest decisions, to make as a 16-year-old teenager. Whether I wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager, or whether I wanted to embark on raising a life when I was just a child myself. That, I think, was the hardest decision I had to make.\nHow do you cope with them?\nWell, my son is almost 19 now, so it's 19 years later. I actually am so glad it was one of the best things that I ever did by not choosing to abort him. Being pro-life, pro-choice, pro-life. I have not regretted the decision. That's my only child, and I love him. He is just a blessing, and I feel very special to be his mom.\nDo you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo, it's not easy. It definitely has its difficulties, just as anything.\nWhat are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents?\nThe first way is I actually listen to my son, and I accept his feedback, even if I don't like it. I allow him to express himself. Unfortunately, when I was little, there was not a lot of conversation from parent to child. It was more like we were just told what to do, and we did it. With my son, I give him options. I allow him to express himself. I allow him to give me feedback, negative or positive. I feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age. As parents, you have to be supportive in that and make sure that you nurture that, because that's the way that they develop.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nIt depends. It really depends. It depends on the time that I go to sleep. It depends on the time that I woke up. There are a lot of factors. I can't just give you one answer. I would say that it varies. Sometimes I can go to sleep and fall asleep right away, and other times I can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep. It varies.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI've been feeling great lately. I really have been. I can't say that the last week didn't affect me, the argument with my husband. Other than that, I've been feeling really good.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo, I haven't.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo, I have not.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nYou know what? Honestly, I feel happy every day. Every day I wake up, I'm happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage. Carpe diem sees the day. I feel blessed. Every morning I wake up, it's a blessing because I realize that some people did not wake up. Some people are homeless. Some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening. That's not me. I feel really, really blessed every day.\nThat's great. Thank you. How are your best friends around you?\nAs nurturing, patient, loving, friendly, kind of reserved.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nWell, I wish that I had already completed college and had my master's degree. Sometimes I wish I was a little bit more knowledgeable in certain subjects. If I could change anything, I would change that, those two things. Also, I would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert.\nIs there anything you regret?\nYou know what? No regrets. You live and learn. Nothing is perfect. Everything that I've gone through has made me the person that I am today. So I wouldn't change anything because I'm happy with the person that I am today.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nOh man, to stay in school. To stay in school and to get your education and to put that first and foremost before a relationship, even before your career, I really, really would have told myself to stay focused and to get a great education.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nI'm most proud of where I've come from as a teenage mother. Being a statistic and actually changing that. Being on my same job for 15 years now, I'm really proud of that. I've been married for 13 years. I'm really proud of that. Happily married to my best friend and my soulmate. Nothing's perfect, but he's my best friend and I love him. I'm also proud of my son being the mother that I am and the son that I've raised. I'm proud of the job that I've done. I really applaud myself for that.\nOkay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're welcome. You were wonderful. Thank you. Bye-bye.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally welcome. I'm going to be your guide. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Spectacular. This is an interesting experiment. Awesome. Where are you from originally? I am from the United States. I am from the middle of nowhere, Iowa. Really? When did you move to LA? May 2, 2007. Exactly five years ago. Six years ago. And frequently, like once every couple of years. Okay. How does it compare to LA? The weather exists so it's more extreme. And then it's rather less exciting, a lot less colorful. Why'd you move to LA? Uh, winter in Minnesota. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Uh, it took approximately the drive in. That's about all it took. The lights took care of the rest. Wow. What are some things you really like about LA? I really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime, so that bicycles have free reign of the streets. I like all the art. I love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together, and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about your trips. What's one of your most memorable experiences? What's your favorite part of your trip? That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Can you tell me about that? That's great. Sometimes when I'm being intense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? How are you at controlling your temper? When was the last time you argued with someone? When did it happen? That time was really hard. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. What's something you feel guilty about? Why? Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. What made you decide to do that? Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you lately? Can you tell me about that? You hit me with the best inspiration words. There's the part where she actually works on the exact things that make me excited. There's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance. And then there's the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time. All of those things are really nice, but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return, that's smitten. How do you know them? What a funny question. How do I know them as though she's multiple people? How did you know? How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? What are you like in your sleep now? Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Why? I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the Arthur C. Clarke sense. So as a fortunate and vaguely aware being, it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yeah. My excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate. And I'm feeling more and more inspired all the time. If I could just work on the motivation, I'd be set. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with sleep-sickness? Not since you asked me on the forum a little while ago, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. I used to think I had it, but who knows at this point. That was a while ago. Can you tell me about that? I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time. And then I moved to Los Angeles and started having fun. And then the rest is ancient history. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. 2013. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Awesome. How would your best friend describe you? What would you say are some of your best friends? I guess I'm enthusiastic. I am... ...phasoric. And I am... I'm going to have to say highly analytical. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Like what? What are you most proud of in your life? That's a really tough one. I think the thing that I'm most proud of would probably be... I'm not actually sure. Is there anything you regret? Oh, all sorts of stuff, but I'm working on that. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't masturbate so much. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Okay, I think I've lost everything I knew so far. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye, Ellie. Okay. What a hoot.",

         "Okay. I'm good. I'm a little tired.\nWhere are you from originally? I live in Culver City. Originally, I grew up in Venice.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? The beach, fast drivers, the city. I've lived in Utah. I don't really like anything else about the city.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know many people who live here anymore. Traffic. It's too big. But it's home.\nDo you travel a lot? I've been out of the country a few times.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing new places.\nWhen I was 14, I went to Costa Rica to visit my father. And I was there for two weeks. That was the last time I'd been there.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? In Costa Rica.\nSeeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker.\nHow did you feel in that moment? Joy. I was happy, excited, kind of scared.\nWhat made you decide to do that? It wasn't my decision. It was my mom's. She'd planned the trip.\nAre you happy you did that? Yeah.\nWhat did you study at school? I wanted to be an art major, but I didn't understand why. I was in math classes, among other classes. And I thought I was wasting my time, so I decided I really didn't want to do that. So I moved back to LA.\nWhat's your dream job? I don't really have a dream job. I would like to be self-employed, though.\nCan you tell me about that? Right now I'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer, but I'm not really sure.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Around new people, I'm very reserved with the people I do know. I'm a lot more outgoing and talkative. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.\nWhat do you do to relax? I go on walks. I walk my dog a lot. I call my girlfriend if I want to calm down. I also do meditation and self-hypnosis. I try.\nHow hard is that? It depends on how I'm feeling or how upset I am or how calm I'm trying to be.\nCan you tell me about that? If I'm really upset, it's a lot harder for me to calm down and bring myself down through meditation or through self-hypnosis.\nHow are you at controlling your temper? I'm alright at it. Sometimes I lose it. I yell when I lose my temper and I have put holes in walls.\nHas that gotten you in trouble? Not yet.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night, me and my mom got in an argument.\nHow do you cope with them? I don't know. I just lay in bed until I finally fall asleep in the early morning.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? I understand.\nHow have you been feeling lately? I've been alright this weekend. It has been better than most. My girlfriend has stayed at my place the entire weekend. I've been happy.\nWhat? I see what you mean.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy. That's so good to hear.\nThanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.",
         "Okay, so lately I've been feeling alright, especially this weekend since my girlfriend stayed over. That's made me really happy. But when I'm not doing well, like when I argue with my mom, I just end up lying in bed until I can finally fall asleep in the early morning. It's hard for me to calm down when I'm really upset, which makes meditation and self-hypnosis difficult. Sometimes I lose my temper and yell, and I've even put holes in walls before. To relax, I usually go on walks with my dog, call my girlfriend, or try to meditate, but it really depends on how I'm feeling at the time.",

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the arts. I like the weather. I like the people. Mm-hmm. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's expensive. It's smoggy. There's a lot of traffic. I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. Why? Well, I like where I live. I don't like to leave my familiar surroundings. That makes sense. What did you study at school? Uh, I didn't. I didn't study anything. What's your dream job? Enough to make enough money to survive. That would be a dream job. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Somewhere in the middle. Maybe shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I just try and meditate. How hard is that? It's not easy. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Not real good at it, but I don't get angry too often. Has that gotten you in trouble? Actually, I think it has, yes. Can you tell me about that? Work situations where you get angry with another employee and you should be more cool and calm. I see. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Oh, several days ago. It was about somebody's excessive drinking and money. Not my drinking. Frustrated. Person wasn't able to listen very easily. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, stuff that were dating back 20 years ago, things in my marriage, maybe arguing or being difficult. Could you have done anything to avoid it? Sure. I could have been more mindful in certain situations. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. One of them was whether or not I should get married when I was much younger. What made you decide to do that? I didn't want to disappoint my girlfriend. She wanted to get married so I didn't want to hurt her feelings. Are you happy you did that? Yes. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Instances where I wasn't an attentive father. You always want to be the best you can. I'm very hard on myself. I think back in every situation where I don't think I handled myself properly. I understand. Tell me about your kids. I have a 27-year-old son who just got married last month and he's doing very well. He's happy and adjusted. My daughter is 21 and she's in school. She is doing very well also so my kids come out very well. I'm very lucky that they are such good kids. That's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Being consistent. Keeping your emotions in check. What's the best thing about being a parent? Unconditional love from your kids. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? My parents were abusive and they threw me out. I didn't live with them. I lived in a foster home. I'm not like that. I don't hit my kids. I didn't hit my kids. I still don't hit them. I think I'm a better parent. How close are you to your family? I'm close with my son. My daughter not so close but somewhat. That's my entire family, my two kids. I have a sister too so I'm not very close with her. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Certain therapists I've had. Can you tell me about that? They just help me with being mindful, with being less hard on myself. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's difficult. Why? I can't fall asleep and when I do I wake up a lot. After an hour or two. Are you ever really triggered by something? Stress maybe. Maybe just old age. I'm not sure. I looked it up on the internet. It says old people don't really sleep very well once you reach my age. What are you like when you just eat well? I don't know. I feel, I don't feel right. I'm tired, depressed, not well rested. How have you been feeling lately? I've been very anxious and stressed out, somewhat sad. More than somewhat. I've been sad lately. I'm sorry. Can you tell me about that? I'm not working right now. I have a lot of pressures. Things don't seem to be going right. I'm getting a lot of bad news. Things aren't going my way sometimes. Always. Lately. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Yeah, I agree. Have you ever been diagnosed with food testing? No, I haven't. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Depression or sadness, I would say yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I don't know if it's a diagnosis. 30 years ago? 35 years ago? What got you to seek help? Wanting to improve my life. Wanting to be the best person I can be. Wanting to be happy. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Sometimes. It's mostly, I don't know. I don't know if it's useful or not. Sometimes I think it is. Sometimes I think it isn't. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Not much. Very little changes. I'm not sure I've been in therapy for a long time, so I don't... It's been a long time, so I don't know what changes I can attribute to therapy or to myself. I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last month at my son's wedding I was happy. Tell me more about that. Well, just seeing my son happy and doing well and successful and knowing that he turned out to be a better person than me. How would your best friend describe you? I don't have a best friend. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm kind, I'm compassionate, I'm loyal. Funny. I can be articulate. I can't think of anything else right now. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? More content, happier. I need to give myself a break sometimes. I'm very hard on myself. I would like to be easier on myself, not beat myself up so much. When was the last time that happened? Happens every day. Can you give me an example of that? If just every... I registered my car. It cost me a lot of money to register it. And then it didn't smog. I can't smog it. I put it off too long. I procrastinate too much. I should have kept my job. I need to find a new job. Just I'm rambling on. How about yourself? Learn a trade. Go to school. Realizing that I will, the future will come. And it's here. And I'm unprepared. I did my... I prepared my kids though. Maybe movie or theater. I ride my bike. I drink coffee at Starbucks. I like theater and I go to the opera. Conversation with people maybe. What about you? My children. Okay, you're welcome. Should I buzz the buzzer? Okay. What's your name? See if I can ask her name. What's it? Ellie. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording now.",
         "Okay, here's my story about dealing with depression:\n\nI think I've been dealing with depression, or at least intense sadness, for a long time, maybe 30 or 35 years. It's not a formal diagnosis, but I know the feeling well. I initially sought help because I wanted to improve my life, be the best version of myself, and ultimately, be happy. I've been in therapy on and off, but honestly, I'm not sure how much it's helped. I haven't noticed significant changes that I can directly attribute to therapy, and it's hard to separate its impact from just the passage of time.\n\nLately, I've been feeling particularly anxious, stressed, and sad. I'm currently unemployed, which is putting a lot of pressure on me, and it feels like things just aren't going my way. I have trouble sleeping; I can't fall asleep easily and wake up often. I’m very hard on myself and beat myself up about things every day. For example, I procrastinated on getting my car smogged, and now it's going to cost me a lot of money to fix. I also regret not keeping my last job. I wish I could be more content and happier, and give myself a break more often. The last time I felt truly happy was at my son's wedding last month. Seeing him happy, successful, and a better person than me made me really proud.",

         "All right, cool. I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. Are you okay with this? Mm-hmm.\nSo, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. What about you? I'm good. I'm great. Thanks.\nWhere are you from originally? Los Angeles, but I currently reside in Inglewood.\nWait, did I answer your question? Yeah.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? LA? The murals, the ocean, what else? The people. My family's over here, so that's the best part.\nWhat are some things you like about LA? I would say the smog. Yeah, the air. It could be cleaner. And yeah. I mean, there's good people and bad people, too. But yeah, for the most part, it's all good.\nDo you travel a lot? Yeah. I've been to Mexico and the temples and Northern California, so yes.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling? Traveling? Like, cleaner air. That's good. It's healthy for the body. Cleaner blood flow. The people, culture, and stories. And when you come back, you can share stories with your friends.\nI'd love to hear about one of your trips. Okay, so this one time when I was a kid, we went out to the temples and it started raining. So we just started walking through and when we get to the top, one thing I didn't know before is that the higher you go, the smaller the steps get. So people back then had smaller feet. So what happened was as I went higher towards the temple, I had to walk sideways so my feet could measure up to the steps. But once you get up there, it's a nice view.\nAwesome. What did you study at school? General education, but mainly art. Yeah. I took a lot of art classes.\nWhat made you decide to do that? Well, when I was a kid, I used to scribble on walls with Crayola so I figured it kind of stuck around with me so I just pursued it.\nWhat's your dream job? My dream job would be to get paid for painting. Painting art. Yeah.\nHow hard is painting? It's not so much that it's hard. It just requires passion, persistence, and faith and will. You just have to really believe in yourself. The more you believe in yourself, the more likely you are able to succeed.\nDo you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I consider myself to be shy in certain time and places, but I am also outgoing when I have the energy. So I feel like it's well balanced. I'm shy when it's okay to be shy. And I'm outgoing when the need to actually have fun or just explore feels good, if that makes sense.\nWhat do you do to relax? To relax? I don't know if I should say this, but I smoke weed. So that helps. I like painting. Painting helps me relax. Especially when I use a color blue, because a color blue relaxes me. And also green. When I use these two colors and make a painting, it calms me down.\nYou have a blue shirt. My temper? Well, my thoughts control my emotions. That's pretty much how my tempering. I try to make sense. Is it worth getting mad? Or if I do get mad, what would be the outcome? So controlling my temper is just training my thought.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? The last time I argued with somebody was with my father. It was because I wanted to eat food, but he wanted me to buy wine. So right when the food was ready, I was hungry to eat, and he was like, nope. So that kind of frustrated me. The way I handled it was like, well, I could just eat when I come back. I'm doing him a favor. And then after, I could just eat in peace.\nTell me about your relationship with your family. My family? It's pretty good. My mom and dad have a good relationship. We're still married. And my brothers and sisters, we help one another out. So that's good. It's just like a team.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. A situation I wish I could handle differently would be... that's a good question. I mean, can I get a scenario? Whatever comes to mind. Okay. Situation... Well, see, that's the thing. I feel like if I'm calm in any situation, I can figure it out. But if it came down to a Rubik's Cube, maybe, how would I handle that situation would be just by failing, making mistakes. Because if I make the right mistakes, the right lessons will come after. So that's the best way I could answer your question.\nTell me about an event or something you wish you could erase from your life. I've had some pretty bad experiences with being at gunpoint and with a knife. But at the end of the day, what that did was give me more insight. It made me more aware. And it taught me how to read people a little bit more, like to sense things out and also how to avoid situations. So even though it was bad and it did kind of scar me, it did prepare me for the world. Because this happened to me when I was 12, 13 years old. So I was already being exposed to guns, knives and all that stuff. It's bad, but it's good in the long term. Because if you get out of that slump, nothing else would really phase you. Because you think in your head, I've been through worse. So it's not as bad.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever made to make. This one right now. The moment I got stuck, I was trying to think. That was part of it. But the hardest decision as far as life changing? Life changing. Whether to continue school, college or not. I kind of chose to pursue my own. I'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field I want to be in. So that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that I would run into the right people. But I took that chance and I met the right people.\nAre you happy with that? That's good.\nHow easy is it for you to get back to sleep? It's actually really easy. If I wanted to, I could sleep right now in 10 minutes. I could just shut down my mind and slow down my air pattern.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Lately, I've been feeling good. I've been feeling like I have free will. At this point in time, I feel like if I chose a path, any path with my heart, I could get there. But I'm still deciding. All these paths are in the air. Or should I make my own? I don't know. That's where I'm at. I feel like I have free will.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Lately? Like in the past two weeks or today? Whatever comes to mind. Okay. Yeah, things happen that would change my feelings. For example, right now, it just happened. For right now, this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought. Because it's technology. It's a trip to see how far one could take a thought and make it reality. So that's kind of shifting my thoughts right now. This whole experience.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with a stress disorder? Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? No.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Depression? I know how it's like to be depressed, but diagnosed by a doctor? No.\nCan you tell me about that? Depression? How it feels? How does depression feel like? It feels like it's like a bird in a cage. Being depression is like being a fish who can't swim in the water. Feeling depression is like being a bird without wings. Pretty much, it feels like you're limited. But then the thing is, to get out of that depression, it's like you have to awaken and change your perspective. And focus on, I would say colors. Colors help. And people. Talking to people helps.\nWhen was the last time you were depressed? Being depressed? Let's see. I don't know. It could happen every day. It's small doses. I could tell you today, earlier, when I was just by myself, I felt a little depressed. But then what happened, I fixed it. I called up a friend and met up with him.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy. At this moment, I feel pretty happy. I'm talking to a virtual person. It's pretty cool. Right now, I feel happy.\nHow would you describe yourself? Sometimes hard-headed. He would try to teach me a certain lesson, whether it's art or just in my character. He would probably just describe me as like, he would listen, but at the same time, he would still do what he wants to do. So pretty much like, I don't know. That's what he tells me. Overall, a good person.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Probably just exercise. My diet, food, my food intake. Just exercise. Pretty much it.\nTell me about that. What it would be was, it would either be about my art. If I did something and I thought it was good, then someone else would be like, that looks kind of like trash. Then I would be like, oh damn. Either I could accept it and be like, yeah, it does kind of look and then fix it. Or what I would do back then would be like, damn, just kind of dwell on that thought. And then just stay there for a bit and then eventually I'll come out of it. But yeah, usually it's about people's words and ideas.\nIs there anything you regret? Regret? Yeah, I've got a couple of things I regret.\nLike what? Well, sometimes I feel like I should have completed the whole university thing. But I mean, at the same time, I feel like if I really wanted to go, I would have gone. So yeah, that's kind of a regret in my head.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago would be seek spiritual well-being. Learn how to handle your thoughts. Choose your thoughts. I would teach myself. Pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment. Sort of advance your experience and as far as your overall happiness.\nWhat are you most proud of right now? Well, I'm most proud of right now is my paintings. Yeah, I'm proud of that because like I feel like these paintings I'm releasing are things that no one else could duplicate. You know, it's like it's one of a kind and like it's there, you know, it has its own signature. So yeah, I'm pretty happy about that.\nOkay. Thank you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye.",
         "Okay, so when it comes to depression, I haven't been officially diagnosed, but I definitely know what it feels like. To me, depression is like being a bird in a cage, or a fish that can't swim. It's a feeling of being limited. To get out of it, I have to change my perspective. Focusing on colors really helps, and so does talking to people. It's not like I'm constantly depressed, but it can happen in small doses, even daily. Earlier today, I felt a little down when I was alone, but I fixed it by calling a friend.",

         "Okay. You're welcome. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are clearly confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm okay.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nLA.\nReally? What are some things you really like about LA?\nThere's a lot of variety. There's a lot of health oriented stuff. There's all kinds of food to eat. You can go to the desert. You can go anywhere. I mean there's a lot. And the weather's great.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic. Lately the change in weather. It's kind of a little too unpredictable. But mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nI wouldn't say a lot. Just occasionally.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nIt's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe I wouldn't normally do. Different people. Learning about different people. Different customs. It depends. I mean if it's water, real pretty water. Being in beautiful water. Relaxing. Adventure. I love adventure.\nI'd love to hear about your trips.\nSome time ago I went to Cayman Islands and went on...I get seasick but my sister gave me some medication. I went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and I accidentally got back on the wrong boat. Yeah and they were really crazy. They made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat. And I thought I was going to drown because the water was kind of rough. I was really shocked that they wanted me to do that.\nOh no.\nYeah but I survived.\nThat's good.\nYeah pretty good. What did you study at school?\nBusiness management. But also hypnotherapy.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nWell I came from a serious kind of family so that just seems something that would be universal. That would cover a lot of different subjects.\nAre you happy with your choice?\nYes. Yeah. But yes and no. I mean now I kind of wish it was something different.\nLike what?\nI like communication. I love speaking and interviewing strangers. I'm very outgoing and funny. So probably would have been something more like either liberal arts, communication, that type of thing.\nThat makes sense. What's your dream job?\nDream job would just be out there, you know, like some of these people maybe on TV exploring different places and getting paid for it. And always like a fun adventure, interacting with people, doing things I haven't done before. And helping people, you know, in some way with what I do so that they can see that I'm uncoordinated in some ways. And you know, they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver.\nHey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI watch TV. I go work out. I go walking. I recently got like a bike that I kind of sort of fixed up. Go do something new. Go to a festival. Go grocery shopping. Interact with friends. Call them. See them. That type of thing.\nTalk to strangers.\nDepends on the situation. There's a bunch of times I'm good at it. If it has to do with like traffic and cars, it's a little more intense for me. It's a little tougher. Or people who are like really rude, you know, with the way they cut you off.\nLuckily not. You know, I'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes where if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot, I'll confront them on that sometimes.\nMight have been with my sister. I'm not sure of the topic, but whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got it in an argument. It sounds childish about who was right, you know, because she thinks she's always the smarter one because she's older. How do you feel about your mom?\nYeah.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nI'm real close to I see my parents almost every weekend. More close to my mother. I have a twin sister. I stay in touch with her even though she's out of town. She lives out of town and I've got two other sisters, so I stay in touch with all of them. You know, it's a mixed bag. You know, we kind of have a sort of aggressiveness in us a little bit. But also. Well, me. And ever. I mean, strangers, sometimes my family, you know, they've done nice things for me. Strangers have been very sometimes unexpectedly very nice. I could be shopping and, you know, maybe I can't reach something and some guy will pop up behind me and, you know, without me saying anything, just help me out. That type of thing. Or if somebody's like kind of mean to me, somebody will like commiserate, you know, and. I had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me because he thought I didn't like his dog. It was, you know, I'm not crazy about dogs, but he kind of flipped out for me. And I was like, you know, I'm not crazy about dogs. I wish I had confronted that back then because I, you know, but it create a lot of anxiety for me because I feel like I could have nipped it in the bud instead of having to deal with the major stress from it. Now he and I don't talk at all. I just feel it's best. He's kind of odd.\nSometimes breaking up with somebody or. Yeah, usually or getting rid of a friend. That type of thing. Sometimes I feel guilty about some of my past behavior with people. Or maybe I wasn't as understanding. When I was younger, I stole things, you know, that's not the best behavior. And it's stuff like that.\nTell me about that or something that you worshiped or erased from your memory.\nOh God, there's a lot of them. I wish I could erase, you know, how tough my dad was on us as children. And erase a lot of memories of men I dated that just didn't work out well at all. And, um. Yeah.\nI can drop off like right away.\nYeah. Cranky. Irritated. Snarky. A bit out of sorts. I've had some anxiety with money and relationships because I haven't been in one for so long. Meal. Just a lot of anxiety.\nTake a deep breath. Try and do positive things. You know, sometimes. Eat healthier, workout more. Talk to my friend about it. That type of thing. I know I'm not that kind of person.\nTry and look for interesting activities to do. To distract me. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with insomnia?\nWell, not officially. But I know, you know, from things I've experienced that I've had. I've, you know, I get very anxious in certain situations.\nAre you triggered by something?\nYeah. It's usually triggered by, um. Sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy, it triggers a lot of anxiety in me. If they're aggressive. Whether it be physically or verbally. Or sometimes if they're too much in my space. You know, where I am. It bothers me.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nYeah. A long time ago.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nIt was ages ago. Maybe over ten years ago. Fifteen years ago.\nHow old were you when you died?\nUm. I was depressed. I mean, I know that's nothing to laugh about. But I mean, it's kind of in a circle. Just to, um. I wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more.\nWhat were your symptoms?\nFeeling stuck in certain thoughts. Having a lot of negative thoughts. Feeling of hopelessness, helplessness. That type of thing.\nWhat? Still have a therapy now?\nUm. I go occasionally. It's a different type. I'll go see a hypnotherapist. Sometimes to release anxiety that's in me.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful?\nYes, I do. Very useful.\nWhat sort of changes have you noticed since you've been doing therapy?\nA lot more awareness of myself and other people. Learning more control, more confidence. Better self-esteem. Willing to try even more things. You know, whether I know the outcome or not. You know, of the unknown. I'll experiment a lot more.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nWhat was the most difficult thing you've ever done?\nHelping like at the 25th mile, handing out water. And there were some people there who were doing that for the first time. Also, some event at my sister's where there were just a couple of us. And I was cracking a lot of jokes. Sometimes I'm like really funny. You know, and I can't even believe myself. You know, I just go on and on. You know, and everyone starts laughing. I'm not even trying to. And I'm just saying like regular stories. And people look at me funny and laugh.\nYeah. That. How are your best friends by the way?\nAs a really decent, loyal, empathetic. Deserving. Supportive. I'm hoping. Outgoing. Quirky. Type of person.\nUh huh. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nWell, it would be great to look even younger. Uh, or be younger. If that was humanly possible. Be even more patient with people. I think, um, you know, not get frustrated. Like if I think somebody's not very smart. Sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nWhoa. Wow. Make a lot of money and plan for your future. And try and be as kind and patient with people as possible. And have a lot of fun. Try new things.\nUh huh. What are you most proud of in your life?\nI think of my mind and my perseverance that, um, I've changed a lot of things within my personality. I feel proud of volunteer work. I feel proud. I've helped a bunch of people lose weight, declutter their homes. I've helped create a lot of positive change in people.\nThat's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to.\nOh, okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYeah, it was nice talking to you. Goodbye.\nBye.\nShe nods her head a lot. Ha! What's it going to end? I'm going to stop here. Okay.",
         "Okay, so I was diagnosed with depression a long time ago, probably over fifteen years ago. Back then, I experienced feeling stuck in my thoughts, lots of negative thoughts, and a general sense of hopelessness and helplessness. I still see a hypnotherapist occasionally to release anxiety. I find therapy really useful. Since starting, I've become much more aware of myself and others, gained more control and confidence, and improved my self-esteem. I'm also more willing to try new things, even the unknown. These days, I get triggered by people who are really angry or aggressive, either physically or verbally, and when people get too much in my personal space. To cope, I try to do positive things like eating healthier, working out, and talking to friends. I also look for interesting activities to distract me.",

         "Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing well, thank you.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nLos Angeles.\nReally? What are some things you really like about LA?\nSports, outdoor sports mainly.\nLike what?\nSurfing, snowboarding, mountain biking, rock climbing.\nAwesome. What are some things you don't really like about LA?\nTraffic.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nYes.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nExperiencing different cultures.\nI'd love to hear about one of your trips.\nWell, I love going to Mexico. And it's so much different from California and Western culture, so to speak. I know Mexico is a Western civilization, but the level of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that they're like two different worlds.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nTraveling, you mean?\nYeah.\nI would have to say going to an island off the coast of Fiji. Fiji, the name is Tabaruwa, and it's a very small island. You can walk around it in 30 or 40 minutes. And it's a place where you go to go surfing. And it is an incredible, visually incredible and experientially incredible place.\nNice. What did you study at school?\nI studied biology.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nI was pushed from behind by my father, who was a medical doctor, and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also.\nAre you still working in that?\nNot at all. I'm working in areas of business now.\nAre you happy you did that?\nYes, I am.\nWhat's your dream job?\nMy dream job would be to be a missionary.\nReally?\nYes.\nCan you tell me about that?\nMy father's initial objective when he became an M.D. was to become a missionary, and he's a very generous person, and I think I am too. I got that from him herititarily. But I would like to help people, and I don't think being a doctor is helping people. I really don't. I think it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket. I would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources, things like that, if I could afford to travel to remote places like that.\nYeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI exercise.\nOkay. How are you at controlling your temper?\nI think I'm pretty good at it. I think I'm pretty effective at it.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nIt was probably two days ago. It was my girlfriend, and it was about her lack of consideration.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nUm, I felt frustrated.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nA situation which I wished I could handle differently. In my later years, I would say I don't have many regrets. In my younger years, I used to be snubbed by people, and I would keep my mouth shut, and I wouldn't say anything. I would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior. I would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings. I've learned that that is so wrong. And so in probably the last 15 to 20 years, I have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away, and that takes care of the anger immediately.\nHas that gotten you in trouble?\nYes. It depends what you mean by trouble. I think all the way around, once you take the beginning to the end, it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble.\nThat makes sense. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nGoing back, it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted. We argued at length for many months and years about this, and finally I prevailed, and I didn't go that route. But that was probably the most difficult period in my life.\nI see. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nThere was a time when I wished I could erase female interactions, girlfriends and their betrayals. But now I realize that keeping those memories make me who I am today, and dealing with them defines who I am today.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nMy parents are deceased. I had very good relationships with my parents. I'm very thankful for that. Even though my father was somewhat of a hard-handed draconian person, we came to an understanding well before he died. My brothers, I get along great with my younger brother, but my older brother has issues. He has psychological issues, and they continue to plague him and to affect me also, just knowing that he's going through turmoil.\nI'm sorry. How do you cope with them?\nWell, I guess I really don't cope with it because he's clinically depressed, and he has suicidal tendencies, and he's not working. He's very highly educated, and he doesn't talk to me, and his family is very abusive towards him. It's not a happy relationship for his family.\nThat sounds really hard.\nYes.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nI would have to say my father. My father is my hero. He's my model. He's my archetype for what a man should be.\nI understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nOh, I was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking. I always experience joy when I'm exercising at a very high level of exertion.\nThat's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you?\nFunny, jovial, intelligent, perfectionist.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nMaybe to submerge my hedonistic self.\nCan you tell me about that?\nI look at, once again, my father fills my consciousness. He was the ultimate deferrer of gratification. He put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that. And that's what made him the self-made man that he was.\nTell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself.\nMy last day of work when he fired me, he started using a lot of profanity toward me. I turned to him and I said, you cannot talk to me that way. He continued to use more profanity until I objected to it again and that's when he fired me. That's still in my mind and that occurred a year and a half ago.\nWow. Is there anything you regret?\nAnything I regret? Oh yeah, I regret not getting married and having kids.\nCould you have done anything to avoid it?\nSure, I suppose I could. But I think that would have robbed me of the many opportunities I had and I took to travel around the world and experience different cultures. Because that's what I enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness. Because the United States is not the end of the world. Once you get to travel you find out that we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world. Other people think that we're the only ones that think that and I disagree.\nI see what you mean. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nThat's a good one. I would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and I think I've done that. And I may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer. So I think I'm happy with my life thus far.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nI was giving a rock climbing lesson. I have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing. And many of these people have never done it before. And they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives. So that was very gratifying to me.\nThat's great. What are you most proud of in your life?\nI would say my devotion to the environment. I wasn't always an environmentalist. I have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment. Because today there are a lot of people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that. And I stand up and I have been on TV and on YouTube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment.\nOkay. I think I've announced everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're welcome. Goodbye.\nGoodbye. That was interesting.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are incredibly confidential. Are they true?\nI was born in Hawaii, but I grew up in Colorado.\nReally?\nYeah.\nWhen did you move to LA?\nAbout seven to eight years ago.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI try to go back once or twice a year.\nHow does it compare to LA?\nIt's different. It's not as busy. There's more things to do outdoors in the mountains.\nHow long have you been in LA? For work.\nAre you happy to do that?\nYeah, I am. I love it here.\nHow easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?\nIt took about a year before I really felt comfortable, but once I got through that kind of hard year, it was pretty good out here. I had a good time.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nI think it's the traffic.\nDo you travel a lot?\nWhat do you do to relax?\nHow are you at controlling your hunger?\nThat's good.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nHow did you get into a situation that you wish you would handle differently?\nI don't know if there is one. I mean, I'm sure there is, but... One time I was driving behind someone, and they cut me off. And I think it had just been one of those days. This was like a year ago or two years ago. It was just one of those days where I just didn't want... Or it had been a frustrating day. And when this person cut me off and I almost got in an accident with them, I just followed them to their parking spot. And actually I had honked at them, and they flipped me off. And so it just really got into my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then flip me off. So I followed them to the spot, and I asked, I said, Miss, why did you flip me off when you cut me off? And she said, Oh, you know, I've had a rough day. I don't need your attitude. And her daughter was with her, and I told her, Well, you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter. And, you know, I didn't need to be petty like that, but I just... I wanted to be, I guess.\nUm, I guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom, telling her I was gay. I mean, it wasn't hard because it was the right one, but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she had trouble accepting it. And it took a while, but once she did, you know, everything was better. And I knew it would be, but it was just hard in the moment to, you know, tell her something she didn't want to hear.\nHow did that move on, or something that you wish you could erase from your memory?\nUm... When I was a little kid, my grandfather found our dog run over on the road, and he, uh... and brought it in. And I remember as a kid just, like, seeing death like that really just threw me off. It just threw me off and frightened me. It was just one of those moments that I guess I wish I hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed. She was just so sad. And it was just one of those moments I guess you need as a kid, but I didn't really want to experience loss like that in your face.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nMy relationship with my family is pretty good. We're probably not as close as most, but we, you know, we always... we don't talk often, but we talk with love, and we always love each other when we see each other.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nUm... My grandmother was very positive. She was always very encouraging and told me to, you know, pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down. So I'm glad I had her.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nUsually it's easy. Sometimes it's not.\nCan you tell me about that?\nWell, I've been between jobs recently. I start a new job next week. But while I've been off, while I haven't been working, I tend to like...my body wants to stay up later and later and later, and I'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven. So I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty, and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half when I should be... I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine, but I just don't want to stay up, I guess.\nWhat's the most important thing about being a job?\nUh, I'm a little scatterbrained. Today I'm a little scatterbrained because I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning and... so, scatterbrained.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nWell, since I've had a lot of time on my hands, like I don't usually have this much time on my hands, so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working, I guess.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?\nUm, I just thought maybe I'm a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the not working thing.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nMm-mm.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nUm, a couple days ago when I got my new job. When I got hired.\nHow would your best friend describe you?\nUm... outgoing, listening, attentive, um... fun, loyal. Uh-huh. I think. I hope.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nUm, I wish that I... I probably wish that I looked better. I wish I had more hair up here, losing it a little bit. I probably wish I was a little skinnier. This girdle's pretty tight. And, um, you know, sometimes I wish I had more money, but nothing too drastic. I'm okay.\nTell me about a time when someone made you feel really proud of yourself.\nOh, um... When I was a little kid, I was the fat kid. And, um, gosh, I remember I was like going into high school, and it was like the second day. And I remember this guy came up to me and was, um... like he was like pretty nice to me, I thought. And then I didn't realize he'd... like this is like out of a movie, right? Like he had put band-aids on my back that said like, I'm a fat cow, and said like, uh, like, yeah. Like just a bunch of mean stuff. And I didn't know, and I walked around with it for like half an hour. I heard people laughing, and I didn't get it. And then finally this girl just came up to me and was like, there's like band-aids on your back that say all these mean things. And then she just walked away. She didn't like help me take them off. And I remember like I couldn't get them. I was trying to find them. And then, um, I just remember like putting my head in my locker, and like I didn't want anyone to see me cry, so I just like put my head in my locker, and like pretend like I was looking at stuff in my backpack, but really I was, you know, the crying fat kid who couldn't get the mean stickers off his back.\nIs there anything very bad? Anything?\nUm, probably.\nYeah?\nWhat advice would you give yourself in 10 or 20 years?\nUm, you know, I would try to keep, I would try to let myself know to look at things positively and to not like worry what other people think about you. I think I spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me. And as I got older, I didn't care as much, and I started enjoying life a lot more, so.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nUh, I went to Coachella. It's a music festival. It was three days with all of my friends and my boyfriend, and we danced and we went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time.\nWhat are you most proud of in life?\nOh, I guess my career, humble as it may be, I really stuck in LA a long time. When it was hard, I stuck around. I didn't quit, so, you know, I'm proud that I've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood.\nOkay, I think I've asked everything I knew to you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nMy pleasure. Goodbye.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective based on the interview:\n\nI haven't been diagnosed with depression, but lately, since I've been between jobs, I've been feeling a bit off. I have too much time on my hands, which is frustrating. I've noticed I'm more absent-minded than usual. My sleep schedule has also been disrupted; I find myself wanting to stay up later and later, and I struggle to fall asleep at a reasonable time. I also mentioned a childhood memory that was difficult: seeing my grandfather bring our dog home after it had been run over. It was a very sad moment and frightened me. Finally, I mentioned a moment in high school when I was made fun of for my weight.",

         "Okay. Beep, beep. So just a reminder, after she says goodbye, press this button and I'll come back over. Alright. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist. But I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah, sure. So, how are you doing today? I'm alright. I'm in a weird test study right now. Where are you from originally? I'm from Los Angeles. Really? Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? All kinds of different things to do in the city. Like what? Uh, well, I don't know. Each area is a little different and it's hard to get boring around here. Mm-hmm. What are some things you don't really like about LA? You know, the traffic and the smog and all that. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I'd like to. Why? Money, mainly. Lack of money. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like seeing the world and seeing all the different places. And what do you do for all your trips? I went to Russia three years ago. Nice. What's the most memorable experience? I like to go into the churches. We did a huge trip of all the churches in the area. That's great. What did you study at school? Music, for the most part. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I've been playing music for a long time. Are you still working on that? Yeah. What's your dream job? Musician. Touring, performing musician. How hard is that? Really, really hard. Why? A lot of competition and luck involved. That sucks. I agree. Do you consider yourself more shy or a pillion? Little of both, I suppose. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Again, probably just I play a lot of music. Sit down with a guitar for a little while. That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? I would say good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I'm having difficulty thinking of one on the spot right now. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make. I'm not sure. I can't think of anything. What's something you feel guilty about? Guilty? When I was a boy, I stole a little golden bicycle from an old lady. I'm not proud of it. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's not ideal. I live with my parents. I'm 23 years old. That's becoming more and more awkward. I understand. Can you tell me about that? I don't know. I think things are improving. I need to move out. I need to get my own apartment and then we can come back around and be friends, I'm sure, with my parents. Yeah. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. There's a lot of positive influences in my life. I've got a good group of friends, my family. I love them nonetheless. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Easy, I would say. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Not as groggy as some people get. How have you been feeling lately? Just in general. Well, I'd say. Things are all right. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, nothing huge. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I had a really good band practice last night with all the friends. I felt really good about that. Awesome. How are your best friends around you? I think generally funny and good to be around. What are some things you like about yourself? What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Work ethic, I think is a big one. Can you tell me about that? Sure. I have a lot of projects that I've planned for myself in my life, and I have difficulty completing them. Why? I like to use space as an excuse. That's my go-to one. I don't have a good studio to record music. I see. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bothered about yourself. Um. Well, okay. This current band that I'm working with. I was told, I'm a part-time member in this band, and I was told that I wasn't officially in the core group and stuff. I felt pretty bad about that for a few days. I'm sorry. It's all right. Is there anything you regret? Um. In life. Mm-hmm. Maybe going, maybe finishing college. That might be something. Why did you decide to do that? Um. I don't know. I just never came to pass that I would transfer to a four-year university and get a bachelor's degree. What would you say are some of the best qualities? Best qualities? I think generally that easygoingness and good sense of humor. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I did recently that I really enjoyed. Last weekend, I went camping on a beach with a bunch of friends. That was nice. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of, I guess, you know, musical accomplishments. I put a lot of work into that, and I'm finding success in my way. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thank you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. That was interesting. Goodbye. Hit this button. Very interesting. I'm going to stop the recording and you can take that.",
         "Okay, so regarding my experience with depression, I haven't been diagnosed with it. However, there are definitely things that bother me. For instance, I felt pretty bad when I learned I wasn't considered a core member of the band I'm working with; that feeling lingered for a few days. I also struggle with my work ethic. I have a lot of projects planned, particularly related to my music, but I have difficulty completing them. I often use the lack of a good studio as an excuse. Overall though, things are alright.",

         "Okay, sure. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. So, I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? Oh, San Fernando Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I really like the culture. I love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really. I like to go camping, but I don't really travel. When was the last time that happened? I think it might have been around six months ago. I went on a trip with a geology class. Nice. Yeah, it was fun. It's been a memorable experience. What's your dream job? Huh. I don't know, but I really like children and I really like studying their behavior. So I think something along those lines might be it. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm generally pretty outgoing. I tend to be shy around my family, but when I'm around friends and stuff, I think I'm pretty friendly. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with someone, I was probably with my boyfriend. How did you feel about that moment? I'm not really taking my feelings into consideration and I really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because I just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out. I see. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I think a lot of times when my oldest little brother does something wrong, I tend to be harsh with him. We're not as close as my sister and I or my youngest brother and I. And so he tends to be hostile back. And I think that if I were a little bit more gentle, it might be easier to communicate with him. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. When I was 19, I came home from a party, I think around 4 a.m. on a Sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of very nice things. And then he didn't speak to me for about a year. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that I don't live at home. I used to be really frustrated with her all the time because she has a really quick temper. But I think now that I've got a little bit more distance, I can see that she did the best that she could. And I love my siblings. I again, my little sister and I get along really well. She's four years younger than me. And when when she was around 12, when I was around 16, it was really difficult because she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody. And I wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff. So we fought all the time, but we don't anymore. And that's really great. And. We get along OK with my my older little brother, who's 15, and I think I got along pretty well with my youngest brother, who's 12. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? One of the first, not the first, but one of my first philosophy professors. And I really loved her classes and it was really good being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people. That was really motivating since not all my classes were like that. Great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I think it's pretty easy. I mean, sometimes I'll have trouble going to sleep, but generally it's not that bad. I think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, well, I'm really tired. I can get grumpy, but I think usually I'm just groggy. OK. How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good. I'm a little anxious about, um. About getting a job and I'm going to be taking summer school, but it's only one class, so I'll have a lot of free time. Yeah. How do you cope with them? Well, I mean, it's not the end of the world if I don't get a job, but I know that I will eventually. So mostly I think I just try not to think about it too much and I try not to be pessimistic. OK. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Well, I think the last time I felt really happy, I went to a party with my boyfriend at the end of the department party. And I was, you know, I knew a couple of people there, so I felt comfortable, but I was able to meet new people. And there were a couple of kids there, I spent time in the pool and had a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun. That's great. How would your best friend describe you? She would probably say that I'm smart and pretty intellectual. I love to read and to watch really like serious films and TV. And she would probably also say that I'm fun because we like to go out and have fun a lot. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes. So that's a major one, that I'm procrastinating. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. I got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was given 60 some hours of community service. And of course I procrastinated on doing that, so I had to show up to court again to get an extension. And the judge was very mean and he yelled at me, but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought. It seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at. So I understand because that's his job, but it was not great for me because I was really anxious in that situation. That sucks. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, I would have been 12 and 2. But I think I would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents because I think I was a little selfish and self-involved back then. Is there anything you regret? I can't really think of anything. I mean, I regret how I treated my mother when I was a kid, but everyone does that. I do regret a couple of semesters ago I didn't do so well in school and I got a few W's, which I now have to work to get off on my transcript. Do you have done anything to avoid it? I think so. I think I wasn't focusing on school at that time and I didn't see any counselors at school or anything, so I definitely could have done that. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Hmm. I think I probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping on Saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges. And then maybe going out to breakfast Sunday and just like window shopping. What was the most proud thing in your life? I think I was proud of how he turned out and how close we are. That's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.",
         "Okay, so I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I do experience anxiety, especially about getting a job right now. I try to cope by not thinking about it too much and avoiding pessimistic thoughts. I also regret not focusing on school a couple of semesters ago, which led to some academic setbacks. I wish I had sought counseling during that time. There have been periods where I haven’t been as kind to myself as I should be. Overall, though, I'm feeling pretty good lately.",

The beach and the weather.\nWhat are some things you like about LA?\nOh the traffic and the people in this Hollywood scene. Hollywood type image. Not as much as I used to, but I've been to Europe. I went on a cruise, several cruise. Been to Jamaica, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Morocco, London, Portugal, yeah. And I'm going to Hawaii in August. Meeting new people and just seeing new things and just simulating into other people's culture and customs and traditions. Oh, the best trip I ever took is when I was a student at Santa Monica College and took a, it was a Mediterranean cruise. Oh my God, that was the best time of my life. Oh God, being on that ship. I felt electrifying, fulfilled, satisfied. I felt like I can do it. And I just, I moved past the fear and just said, I'm doing this. I'm in law school and I'm going to be an attorney.

Not trouble, but it made it has made people back up all for me. Oh, God, what was the last time I really had an argument?\nI don't know. It's been a while. Argument. It's been a long time that I can't even remember. Oh, God, let's see. Oh, goodness. Oh, just dealing with my siblings and my family and just trying to defuse the situation and not get so heated and just remain cool and calm and collective. Oh, when my mother passed years ago, the conflict over her belongings and all that stuff and, you know, stressful time and everybody else. Everybody's emotions kind of high and arguing back and forth. And now I'm not doing that. Distance and the I just. It's just amazing that these people, I shouldn't say these people that we grew up in the fam. We grew up in the same household. And then as we got older, you know, God takes us on different paths. It's just like, who are these people? Or did I grew up in a household with them? Why are they? And they may say the same thing about me. I don't know. I just like to have peaceful living, honey. Pardon me. Oh, God. Positive influences. Oh, college professors. Friends. Church members. People like that. Oh, God. Divorce. Should I continue with my education?\nI don't know.\ndecide to do that?\nWell with my mom, you only have one mother and when it was over said and done I just wanted to do what was right according to what God would want me to do and I didn't want to have any curses over my life of blessings because the Bible says honor thy parents, my mother and father and all thy days so you can live longer and I wanted blessings and not curses.\nTell me about your life or something that you or she could erase from your life?\nMy marriage.

Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo, never.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nYeah when I went through that divorce and my mother passed out I was really depressed.\nWhat were your symptoms?\nFatigue, tired, no matter what I did I couldn't get any enjoyment. Just a feeling of emptiness and loneliness and isolation and shock, trauma. It was very difficult.\nWhat got you to see the problem?\nTime, um, just time. It just took time just to process to work its way through.\nDo you still go to therapy now?\nNo, no not at all.\nWhy did you stop?\nJust got busy with life stuff.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful?\nYeah I need somebody to talk to.

They were so thankful and grateful. So thankful. And then he invited me on stage because he sings and I felt so when I got up on stage because I like to sing but I'm so shy in front of people and they're judgmental and they might look at me and I got up on that stage and I just I'm like well is this how this feels? This feels good. Oh God. Oh man. Awesome.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nOh my accomplishments. Overcoming them one by one. Setting the goal and reaching them.\nThat's great.

So, you know, the money issue.\nHow does it compare to your life? Maryland is different. And so the comparison is, the only comparison is that they're both cities, but Maryland has its flavor and LA has its own flavor. So they have unique characteristics about themselves.\nWhy did you move to LA? I moved to LA because I was living in Hawaii and I was out of money and I just had enough for a plane ticket and come and stay here in a hotel until I found a job, which I did really quickly. But anyway, so that's why I came here. I didn't want to go home. I decided to come here and just start over.\nAre you happy with your job? I am. I am.\nThat's great.

I don't like some of the policies with regard to the smoking. You know, I really wish that the government would crack down on smoking on the streets, make it like USC.\nDo you tell them a lot? No, not outside of getting on the bus and things like that.\nOkay. What did you study at school? I was studying to be a nurse.\nGood job, interesting. Yeah.\nHow did you decide to do that? I wanted to have a job that pays well, but afforded me the opportunity to use my service gift. So yeah.\nAre you still looking at that? No, I had to put that, put that on the side and I want to get a business degree now. Yeah. My dream job is, is to create new technology. Other than to say I would like to create something that would change the world like Steve Jobs with his iPhone. Yeah.\nDo you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I am, it depends on the situation, but I'm more outgoing. I do tend towards a little shyness from time to time.\nWhat do you do when you're relaxed? What I do is I'll go to the movies.\nWhen was the last time you were out there? I went to the movies probably like maybe five weeks ago. Yeah. Okay.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? Well, I had an argument recently, not really an argument, but a disagreement with a woman at my church who is over this particular department that I'm in. And it's a volunteer position. I use my administrative assistant, more executive assistant skills to, I do minutes for meetings that I cover. And so then I have to produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that. And this person is micromanaging me, but not micromanaging the other admin assistant who did not get her block of people into this particular meeting. So the meeting should have been comprised of a hundred people, but we have like maybe 30. No, it wasn't even 30, 20. Yes. So now she doesn't know that I realized that part of it. So there was a little bit of an argument and but again, not an argument, but a disagreement. And when we talk again, I will point out to the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect. There's a disconnect and the energy she's investing in me is unprofitable for what we're trying to achieve.\nDoesn't that sound good? Yeah.\nHow are you controlling your temper? It depends on, I'm very good at controlling my temper. It's, you know, there are places where you can allow your temper to come out, even though it might not be appropriate. And then there are other places where if it comes out, then you shut yourself in the foot. So I'm pretty good at controlling my temper. Yeah. I don't have any situation recent that I can think of. I would probably say just dealing with a neighbor instead of responding to the neighbor, just ignore the neighbor altogether. So I wish I'd done that differently. Yeah.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Thankfully, I've not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet. I have what I do in my life and, you know, in my going forward, you know, everything that I've done and everything that has happened, I accept it as something that has to be to get me to go forward. I am a born again Christian, and so I know that that God is sovereign over my life and also that according to his word, the Bible says that every day of our life is written in his book. So events and circumstances, I feel that I feel they are ordained by God. Now, obviously, I'm not going to jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous, but I feel that things that have happened, even if I've dealt with them the wrong way, it's God's his total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good. So that's how I feel.\nSay that again. People that I've grown up with neighbors from when I when I was younger, that I was close to different friends that I've had along the way, friends who are more like family. So yeah, they've had positive influence.\nNo. That was recent. Something happened. I was able to participate with my church on Sunday, I was a Pentecost. It was Pentecost Sunday, meaning it was 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And so I was able to participate in our prayer session that we had at my church and that was really made me very happy.\nThat I'm smart. They would say that I'm smart. That that I handled difficulties very well. And then I dress well.\nI don't want to change anything. I do want to just be a better me. So be a better person. So I am working on listening better, communicating better and and accepting my weaknesses better as well as my strengths.\nNo. That's a good question. I would have. I would have told myself to. To do what I know to do to do what I know. That which is right. And. To do what I know is right and let everything else. Let the other chips fall where they may. But to do what I know to do is right. And to go forward.\nI am very proud of the fact that I am a Pentecost. I am very proud of the fact that I don't give up.\nBye and thank you. Thank you.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, based on the interview:\n\nI didn't specifically mention having depression in the interview. However, I did mention being out of work due to \"the money issue,\" and having to put my nursing studies \"on the side\". I also spoke about moving to LA because I was out of money in Hawaii and wanted to start over. These experiences may have been related to depression.",

So I'm going to go ahead and start up the virtual human that you'll be talking to. When it's over, will you just go ahead and ring this bell so I know that it's done? Okay, great.\nWill it let me know that I'm done? Yes.\nOkay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? I'm doing alright.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally? Originally, I'm from California. I'm born in Glendale.\nNice. How do you like your living situation? I'm not too happy with it.\nWhy? Just unemployed at the moment. But I'm actually seeking, doing what I'm supposed to be doing. There's some prospects there, but hopefully I'll learn something today.\nIt can be tough to find a good job these days. Do you have roommates? Yeah.\nWhat is it like for you living with them? Well, I have one as a girlfriend, so I consider her a roommate. Lover type thing.\nOh. How close are you to them? We're pretty close.\nHow do you know them? I met her last year. We've been through some troubling times, but we're starting to see a light at the end of them.\nThat's good. Tell me more about that. The troubling times?\nYes. Let me see. Well, I got into a DUI last year and lost my job. I'm a truck driver by trade, so that kind of threw me way off. Having a $1,400 a week job and then going to nothing. Plus losing my license really threw me off. I haven't really found anything that I was interested in, so I started cooking. I was trying to see which other route I could go as far as having some kind of a career. I'm choosing to go into the culinary field, but meanwhile I still have to work. It's hard to find a job without going to school. I applied at RAL, so hopefully I'll get that job. I should have that job, actually. I'm starting to see a light at the end of that tunnel now, little by little.\nThat's good. What's your dream job? My dream job would be probably forestry service. Out in the wilderness.\nHow did you decide to do that? I have a lot of love for animals. I'm an exotic animal trainer by trade. I don't like people too much. Being outdoors, I've always enjoyed being outdoors. That's how I like being a truck driver. I've traveled the world. I don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or in an office. I'm more of an outdoors type of guy.\nYeah. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips would be, I spent a year and a half in Japan on the lower island there. They built that bridge, the largest bridge in the world. I went there to work for an all-white tiger act, working for the Japanese circus. It was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of Americans. That was one of the islands also that they bombed. There was a lot of negativity, but I pretty much have a good outlook on life. Especially during those times. I enjoyed myself, all the traveling and meeting new people and eating different diverse foods. It was a good experience for me. All that whole experience was pretty good for me. Traveling around with circuses. It's been great.\nNice. What are some things you really like about LA? There's not a lot that I like about LA, but I like Hollywood. I like the movie industry. The huge... different ethnics of people here. I enjoy talking to a lot of foreigners. I like to see where it came from and what it's like there.\nYeah. Traffic's ferocious. Yeah.\nWhat are some things that make you really mad? Traffic. Ignorance. Being disrespectful or whatever. Other people being disrespectful towards you or other people. That's about it.\nOkay. When was the last time that happened? It happened on a daily basis. It seemed like... I ride the bus a lot. Or if I'm riding my bike, people tend to almost run me over. I'm not totally paying attention to traffic. I find myself sometimes having to wait to see what they're going to do instead of I having to ride away or stuff like that.\nThat sucks. Yeah. Big time. What do you do when you're annoyed? I probably sit there and vent. Speak my mind even though a lot of times it's by myself. Just like assholes or whatever. Wishing that I carried rocks in my back pocket so I can... It happened so much where it just amazed me at what people would do sometimes. You almost get run over. I probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis. If I wouldn't pay attention, I'd be up shit creek.\nYeah. How hard is that? It's hard with dealing with people, especially trying not to react because there's consequences to your reactions.\nYeah. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? It was with my girlfriend and it was about being honest. I'm pretty honest with... I'm open and honest about anything and everything. What it was about was just her lying to me, telling me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something in that aspect. I come to find out a week later that it was a total lie. I just didn't like that at all.\nYeah. How did you feel in that moment? Let me see the word for it. She just said, I don't know now whether I can believe anything she said. I felt hurt that we'd been in a relationship for a little bit. That's probably one of my biggest pet peeves is being honest. I don't hold back. I'm pretty honest with anything and everything that I do or say. If you're lying about something, you're always having to cover up, moralize with the lies that you already told. It took a lot from me trusting her now. Now I'm like, is it truthful? Is it not? It's kind of hurt our relationship.\nI'm sorry to hear that. It's not involving. What are some things you like to do for fun? Fun? I like going to the beach. I love shooting darts, but I haven't done it in a while. I love to paint. I got into watercolor painting. I'm pretty gifted at that. I want to try some other mediums. I love fishing. I haven't gone in a while though. I like driving a truck. My job, I really, really enjoy it. I don't like driving through cities, but usually when I'm in the middle of the night, I see all the stars. I like stargazing. I see if I can pick out some of those astronomy stars up there. I'm a pretty easygoing guy, so shooting pool, sunshine, just what I like.\nThat's great. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Probably playing with lions and tigers, wrestling a baby elephant in a mud puddle.\nOh my gosh. Just enjoying myself. Awesome. How close are you to your family? Not. I don't have much family as it is. At least here in the States I don't. My mom's from Central America. But I'm not close to. I have three brothers, one sister, and I'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings. I speak with one brother quite a bit. My other youngest brother, I just rather not, I converse with him, but I try to keep it on a professional basis. My sister I don't talk to at all. My other brother underneath me, I haven't spoken to him in years. So I'm just close with my mom, my niece, some of my nephews, and that's about it.\nOkay. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yes.\nTo avoid them? Yes.\nYeah, I just don't talk to them. I don't call them. I don't ask about them. I talk to my mom quite a bit, my brother quite a bit, but I just don't bring up those subjects. Or if they are brought up, I just usually say, you know, that's on them, and I really don't want nothing to do with them. What does that mean?\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's been hard lately. It's been probably hard for the last, going on a year. You know, it depends on my thought process at the time. Like I said, I've been looking for work quite a bit. So just wondering why I don't get calls. I just have racing thoughts. So, or I get depressed, you know, or I worry about things that, you know, that really I have no control over. So, you know, lately I've just been sleeping a little bit too much. At least for me, because I'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a night, and now it's changed to about eight to nine hours, and I'm still tired. Do you feel that way often? Lately I have been. Probably about the last few months.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. If I don't sleep well, then I just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me. So, you know, I'm more of a guy, I love the work. And if I'm not, then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head. And so, you know, like if I'm busy, if I'm doing what I, you know, in whatever job I do, I kind of, you know, get into it. I enjoy it. It's something new for me. And so I can think about, you know, either work or I can go home and then think about this. You know, I don't have to worry about, you know, money, you know, bills getting paid. And I can just concentrate on other things, either doing the things I like or maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend.\nHow do you cope with them? How do I cope with them? I just try not to think about it. It's not about whether coping with it or not. I just do. It's I'm more of a guy that just, you know, it may take me a moment to say that I'm coping with something. But, you know, if I have no control over it, there's nothing that I can really do about it. The only thing I can do is continue to do what I'm doing. And that's actively looking for work, actively going out on interviews, talking with others about work so I can just kind of, you know, get back to, back to basics. You know, I just don't let a lot of stuff bother me. It does bother me, but I try not to let it continue bothering me.\nYeah. Has that gotten you in trouble? My moods, I mean, yeah, money. I mean, you know, my past, I got a past history, so which kind of tends to bother my, my hiring process. I don't know if I'm going to get hired, so I got to deal with different, different type of employers who are, say, felony-friendly and stuff like that. And I try, you know, I've taken classes on, on how to interview, how to answer some of the questions, which, you know, come up quite a bit. And I kind of reflect back on that, but I just, I got to keep putting it into my head that that's not who, who I want to be anymore. So, or, you know, I've done, I've done my time, so to say, but I took the time, you know, the last time I just took a lot of time and, and tried to work on the issues that were bothering me. So, you know, towards positive stuff, I got my GED, different things, took a lot of classes, thought about going to school, looking to go into school, and anything that would kind of change my old ways and, and try to move on to more productive activities.\nMm-hmm. That's good. Do you feel like therapy's useful? I still didn't hear you.\nDo you feel like therapy's useful? That people have been deceitful? Can you repeat that one more time? Why don't we talk about that later? All right.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? I've been diagnosed with bipolarism.\nHow hard is that? It's tough if you don't, you know, I don't medicate, so, I mean, I have been on medications before in the past, but again, as I try to live on, I try to live life on life's terms, and I just, you know, I know the medical establishments always want to label something, and what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills. You know, I've been on probably every manageable pill that there is for that, and, you know, some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough, and so I just try to cope with things with just my life skills, you know. I don't want to be using drugs. I know certain drugs work for like three to four months, six months, and then they go, well, here, I'm going to try you on this, or I'm going to try you on that, and it's just an ongoing process, and I probably for about the last two years, actually about three years, I kind of just said, you know what, that's it. And whether it's different than, or if I would be on meds for it, I don't think so, you know. It's still the same stuff. I still get the same problems, and I still get the same anxieties as if I was on medication for it or not, so I just, you know, deal with it, you know. Sometimes it's not good. You know, I get irritated at people a lot. I don't like people. I don't like crowds. I don't like obnoxious people. Usually I'm going to be quiet, so. But I got a person, you know, it's not to that personality, but I think people can see me and just say, don't mess with this guy, or, you know. But still, you know, I like, I ride public transportation quite a bit, and you know, you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there. Sometimes I got to get off the bus. That's how I deal with people, because if I just know there's consequences if I didn't deal with it that way. So I just let it go. I'd rather take the time on getting off the bus, waiting for the next bus, and hopefully it's not that bad. Did I have a problem before I got out? Well, I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out. The thing is, I know other people, I have a lot of ups and downs. So I know a lot of, in my younger days, people would tell me, you know, when I told them that I was diagnosed with bipolar, that a lot of remarks were like, oh, that's what's wrong with you. We wish that you would have found that out years ago. And like I said, I don't think the meds really work, but what I do, I think time kind of, you know, getting older kind of, you know, makes it work. You know, me dealing with life.\nHarvey? I talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while, recently, and it helps a lot, you know, just to get out my anger, my thoughts. A lot of people, other people may not understand that, but a therapist is, I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out, whatever is bothering me, whether it be people, you know, other issues, you know, whatever the case may be, I just think talking about it. And they're such good listeners and can come in, you know, they give me the same advice that I would give myself or that I would give to others. But it's always helpful to hear from somebody else, somebody who supposedly has, you know, are, you know, they go to school for this.\nRight. But it's good to be there. It's so good to hear. Yeah. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Well, I don't go anymore, so I kind of miss it. You know, like I said, I miss it a lot, actually, but it's just one of those things, I just deal with it accordingly, you know, if I ever get a chance to go through therapy again, I probably will.\nWhy did you stop? Well, monetary reasons and, you know, I don't have health insurance. There's a lot of things that, you know, I'd like to do, but I can't, you know, money situation is not that great right now.\nI'm sorry. How do your friends describe you? They would probably describe me as an energetic, outgoing person, once I get to know people. I laugh a lot. But it would probably tell you that I'm also very serious and a hidden person. I don't reveal a lot.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my boss. One of my bosses, when I first started with exotic animals, he was real, you know, he was German and they didn't teach, I don't know what he saw in me, but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and showed a lot of confidence in me and also built confidence in myself. And sort of let me know that there's nothing that I really can't accomplish if I put my mind to it.\nThat sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and shut this down and take your mic up and then we just have a quick post for you to",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nI was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which has been tough to manage, especially since I choose not to take medication. I've been on many medications in the past, but I felt like they were just experimenting with me and none of them really worked for me in the long run. I prefer to cope with life using my own skills. Even though I don't medicate, I still experience the same anxieties and problems. I get irritated easily and don't like being around people, especially in crowds or with obnoxious individuals. Lately, I've been sleeping too much and have racing thoughts, especially concerning my job search. When I don't sleep well, I dwell on these things. I used to go to therapy weekly, and it helped me to get my anger and thoughts out. I miss it, but I stopped going due to financial reasons, as I don't have health insurance.",

         "Okay, perfect.\n\nThank you.\n\nHi, I'm Al. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Where are you from originally?\nLos Angeles, California.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nThe Southern California lifestyle, the beaches, the active lifestyle.\nOkay. What are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic, the pretentious people.\nYeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nMy teachers.\nTell me more about that.\nI don't know. Certain teachers got... Spiritual teachers that I find a lot of guidance from.\nWhat are some things you like to do for fun?\nI like to skateboard. Awesome. And just stay active, stay healthy. Anything that's outdoors and active and healthy. Hiking, biking, rollerblading, skateboarding.\nThat's good. Do you travel a lot?\nNo.\nWhy?\nNot really in a position to travel financially.\nI understand. What do you enjoy about traveling?\nIf I could, I'm sure I would enjoy seeing all the different cultures and places and meeting all the different people and all the interesting structures and food.\nYeah. What do you do to relax?\nI meditate. And I sit down. I meditate. And I skateboard. Well, I can meditate on my board.\nCould you say a little more about that?\nI meditate. It helps me relax. Sometimes if I don't really feel like skating hard, I'll just go for a nice sunset skate and meditate, a nice two hour skate and just relax.\nThat sounds like a great situation. How hard is that?\nIt's not that hard. You just gotta get to the skate spots. I usually like skating. There's some good skate spots in LA, streets in LA. The beaches is always good. Nice. Just, it's really not that hard at all.\nOkay. What are some things that make you really mad?\nThe situation with my life right now, I can't find a fucking job. I just need a job.\nIt can be tough to find a good job these days.\nI don't even care about a good job. I just need a job. Anything that pays. Just gets hard after a while.\nYeah. Can you tell me about that?\nI mean, I applied from anywhere and everywhere. From entry level to management to anywhere in between. I can't find a job. I can't get a job. I'm trying.\nYeah. I'm sorry.\nIt is what it is. Do you feel down?\nYeah, it's pretty depressing. It's hard. It sucks.\nYeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nIt isn't.\nDo you feel that way often?\nYes, that happens often.\nWhen was the last time that happened?\nLast night I couldn't sleep.\nWhy?\nJust thinking about my situation. A car payment was due yesterday. And I just, I don't know if I have what it takes to continue to do this. You know, I survive day by day trying to see if I can eat at the end of the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression?\nYes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nAbout three years ago. Four years ago. Couple years ago.\nWhat got you to seek help?\nMy mood was just not right. I was always feeling down and depressed and lack of energy, always wanting to sleep. Lack of interest. Do you feel like therapy's useful?\nI've gone to therapy. It has been useful for me in the past. Is it useful for me now? I don't know, I don't have health insurance. I would love to talk to someone. I just feel like I don't have anyone. So I don't depend on anyone.\nYeah, I'm sorry. Did you think you had a problem before you found out?\nOh yeah, I've always felt depressed in my life.\nWhat were your symptoms?\nLack of energy, wanting to sleep a lot, lack of interest. My appetite was uncontrollable, either lack of or I was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things. Having noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?\nYes.\nCan you give me an example of that?\nMy sister just passed away.\nI'm sorry to hear that.\nIt's all right, six months ago. And I became homeless and jobless two weeks ago. Homeless and jobless two weeks ago. And I got to a point where I just missed her and I wanted to be with her.\nYeah. How close are you to your family?\nPretty dysfunctional family. You know, really can't depend on them. That's why I just depend on myself, so.\nThat sounds really hard.\nIt is what it is, what are you gonna do?\nYeah. I'd like to give up, but my parents just buried their daughter six months ago. They don't wanna bury their other daughter. So. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nI don't know. I don't know, I just, I just haven't had good luck. I was a corporate manager for 20 years. And, who would've known 20 years ago what advice I would've given myself because I tried to commit suicide instead of returning back to work. And so now it's just, it's been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and get my life back together. I don't know what advice I would give myself when I started with my corporate job 20 years ago. Okay, I didn't know I'd be here 20 years later. You know?\nYeah. When was the last time you felt really happy?\nReally happy? A couple days ago this week, I've been trying to make ends meet. I've got a lot of things prouding. I've got a lot of things that are happening for me, but I need like two more weeks here in LA so I can connect the dots. But financially I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. So I was happy because I was getting callbacks. Things were starting to look up for me, but it's just time again isn't on my side. So my car is packed and I'm hitting the road and I'm taking off and I'm leaving LA. How would your best friend describe you?\nLoyal, emotional, strong, and a little bit of a\nDo you consider yourself an introvert?\nI have been lately. I was an extrovert for 20 years when I was a corporate manager. And now I am quite an introvert and I stay to myself.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nCircumstances in my life I don't feel as confident. I don't feel as charming and as social.\nOkay. What's one of your most memorable experiences?\nI don't know. It's hard to say. Can't really answer that one.\nOkay. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nThank you.\nGoodbye.\nBye.\nOkay.",
         "Okay, here's my story with depression, in my own words:\n\nI've struggled with depression for years, officially diagnosed about three or four years ago. But honestly, I think I've always felt it to some degree. It got to a point where I realized my mood just wasn't right. I felt constantly down, lacked energy, wanted to sleep all the time, and lost interest in things. My appetite was either nonexistent or completely out of control.\n\nRecently, things have been even harder. My sister passed away six months ago, and just two weeks ago, I became homeless and jobless. There was a point where I just missed her so much that I wanted to be with her. My family isn't really a support system, so I feel like I'm completely on my own.\n\nI used to find therapy helpful, but now I don't have health insurance, so it's not an option. It's tough because I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to. I even tried to commit suicide once, instead of returning back to my corporate job. Now, I'm just trying to pick up the pieces.\n\nI've been feeling really down because I can't find a job, even though I've been applying everywhere. It makes it hard to sleep, especially with things like car payments looming. I was feeling happy a couple of days ago because I was getting callbacks for jobs, but I don't have the money to stay in LA long enough to follow through. So, I'm hitting the road again.",

         "Should I move my arms around? So that just shows that it's active and we know that it's active. Okay, so now I'm going to do something with you. And now I'm going to start up a virtual chat. I'm going to ask you some questions in the chat with you and when you're done, show us how you're done. And I just go ahead and bring you in.\nDo I push a button to start or does she start on her own? Okay.\nImpressive. Yes.\nFine, how about you? Here. Yes. Okay. Yes.\nThe weather. The weather mainly. Not the people, but some of the people. Stuff like that.\nNot as much as I used to. I used to be in school and travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that, but I'm not in school right now. But later I'll get back into school and I'll travel more. But right now, no.\nI don't enjoy traveling.\nGood question. You're actually pretty good. I studied physics and aerospace engineering, but physics mainly.\nYes, I am, actually. Right now I teach community college physics and astronomy. I'm doing research in physics also because I like that type of thing. I'm going back to grad school. Hopefully that's why I'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire.\nImpressive. A professor at a place like USC or UCLA or something like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest. You are actually pretty good at this.\nWho's the first one that you were happy with? There's a lot of people. The first one I guess is my AP physics teacher in high school. Even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major, he still was a very good influence. He told me that school was not about a grade but about learning.\nHow are you doing with your life? I'm pretty good, I think.\nWhen is the last time you had a relationship with your boyfriend? I'm single so I don't get into many arguments. But it's probably my brother about he doing some things too and playing a video game together. I know I'm pretty old to play video games but that's actually pretty good. It's probably something like that. Being angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right, that's all.\nWhat places do you see your parents? I see them pretty often. They're getting older so I help them with groceries and things like that. My brother, same with them. My sister, I tutor her kids, my nephews. I see them about once a week also. Yes.\nI spend a long period of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody. That's introverted.\nWhat do you do for a living? I guess I play video games and I work out. I work out, I think, a lot. I try to at least.\nWhat do you do for a living? I close my eyes. That's about it, I think.\nWhat do you think is the biggest problem? Bad parenting. Parents are more self-centered, more into themselves, unlike previous generations. Parents aren't being parents, in my personal opinion.\nWhat do you think is the biggest problem? I guess... the thing is what's the real problem?\nWhat kind of Yawn does it take? Thank you.\nI don't really have a best friend. I'm biased obviously, but they are really good in math. I'm not really sure if you can't, not saying you can't get better than me in math, but the thing is, it's just that you get a certain confidence with it, no matter what it is you need to learn in math, you've always figured it out.\nI am patient, I think. And I am disciplined where I can spend many hours reading books that might not be important, but they might be important. I have to do it anyway. That's how I think.\nWhen I have a good workout, I'm doing well in video games, small, middle things like that. When something happens with my research type thing, mathematical or physics type thing, when it goes well, that puts me in a good mood. Thank you.\nRight now, it's a fact that research, that I did make it this far research-wise, that's all.\nInteresting. When you start off in school, you read about Einstein and things like that, he says general relativity and you hear about particle physics, you have no idea what it is, you know it's very complicated, things like quantum mechanics. And you start realizing your interest in that, but you're not sure if you can actually make it. And eventually, each step of the clock, time goes by, as time goes on, you get closer and closer, eventually you make the goal, you realize you are just not as good as Einstein, but you are up there, you can do research in physics, you can add to mass knowledge in science, and that's impressive that you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid. Okay.\nA few weeks ago when I got a good grade in a class. Thank you.\nCan you ever say it in English? Yes, briefly.\nMany years ago, yes.\nHow did you start doing that? I don't know, just growing up I always thought that was my dream when I was a kid, that's why. And I just went about doing that.\nHow did you get into the field? I was a National Guarder, I think about 18, 19. I got commissioned at 20, 21. I was only in for about a year, so I left at 22.\nDid you grow up in the field? Yes, not really.\nDid you grow up in the field? I don't think I did. I think I did. I think it's just something that I grew up already expecting to be, so it didn't really change me as much.\nWhat did you do in math or physics? Graduate school. And physics. Okay.\nHave you ever been in a math class? No.\nHave you ever been in a math class? No.\nHow did you get into the field? It depends on how I work out really hard the day before. If I work out pretty hard it's bad, but if I don't work out it, I don't know, it's hard. I guess moderately. Thank you.\nYes. It's okay. I'm probably like I am now. Normal, I think. Not as happy about everything, but still pretty okay. I can still function.\nHave you ever been in a math class? No.\nMaybe slightly. Sorry. No. Yes.\nYes, I have changes in my thoughts. Okay.\nWhy not? I'm applying to grad school again. It's been a while. And slightly apprehensive. Happy that it looks good, but apprehensive that it might not be good. Things like that.\nWhy not? What do you mean by that? I know it's a computer, but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school? I understand. Okay.\nI agree. No, not really. Probably keep doing what you're doing, even though I'm not that old, believe it or not. 20 years ago I was probably 15. No, no. Almost 15. Just keep doing what you're doing. I think I was very lucky in the way it worked out. If it was a little bit different, I don't think it would have worked out so well. Even though it's not perfect now, I think we're doing really well, personally. Thank you.\nSame here. Goodbye. I'll keep this on. Take this off now? Yeah.",

I get slightly apprehensive, especially now that I'm applying to grad school again after a long break. I'm happy that things look good, but worried they might not be good enough. My mood is definitely influenced by external factors. A good workout or doing well in video games puts me in a good mood. Success with my physics research also makes me feel good.

         "Okay, great.\n\nOkay. So now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and ask you some questions. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. I'm going to put the doorbell right next to you. So you can ring the door once you're done.\n\nDo I see her?\nYeah, you'll see her. There she is.\n\nWow. Here's your doorbell.\nThank you.\n\nOkay. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and to welcome them on you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully welcome. Are you okay with this?\nYeah. Yes.\n\nSo, how are you feeling today?\nFine.\n\nHow are you?\nI'm great. Thanks.\n\nWhere are you from originally?\nBorn and raised right here on the west side.\n\nReally? Venice Beach. Awesome. What's the things you like about LA?\nEverything. The beach, the weather.\n\nOkay. The girls. What are the things you don't really like about LA?\nNothing. Okay. Traffic maybe. I can't even remember.\n\nWho's someone that's been a positive employee?\nMy family. I'd love to hear all about it. My mother. She's a very good-hearted person. Gives me good advice.\n\nThat's good. What are some things you like to do for fun?\nFamily comes first. Family's number one. Go to the gym. You know, exercise. Go to the beach. Party every once in a while. Watch basketball, football. Okay. Take trips. Go to Vegas.\n\nWhat's the last time you had that?\nWhich one?\n\nWent to the gym last night. I have friends that live in Vegas, so I go there often. Enjoying the travel?\nI just take a trip, get out. Get away from the city for a minute. But I'm a city boy, so it can't be way too long. You know, head up the city.\n\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI don't go to the beach.\n\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nOh, that's been a problem over the years.\n\nWhat's the only thing you worry about?\nI don't know. I just have a little anger, I guess. Anger management problem.\n\nWhen was the last time you had a problem with someone?\nProbably only yesterday. I forget what it was about.\n\nWhat do you do when you're in life?\nI go to the gym.\n\nWhat are some things that will be really annoying?\nPeople.\n\nTell me more about that.\nI don't know, just people. Just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes.\n\nOkay. What's your dream job?\nDream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Plan Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far, the past 10 years. Then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX. I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA Airport.\n\nNice. What's one thing that most number of people experience?\nWhat, working at the airport? I guess during the holidays there was some girl that worked there. I had a crush on her, but she turned out to be a lesbian. She's beautiful. Yeah.\n\nHave you ever served in the military?\nNo.\n\nHave you ever been diagnosed with a disease?\nNo. I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No.\n\nWhy did you stop?\nI just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped.\n\nI'm sorry you're late.\nNo problem. It's not your fault.\n\nDo you think it's their disease?\nExcuse me?\n\nDid your parents just help you?\nIt wasn't when I was a teenager.\n\nTell me more about that.\nWhat, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know?\n\nHow have you been doing lately?\nI'm not going forward as fast as I want to.\n\nThat sounds really hard.\nYeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is.\n\nHave you done anything to avoid it?\nTo avoid what?\n\nGoing forward?\nI guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would.\n\nExcuse me?\nYeah, I guess.\n\nAre there?\nYeah, it's like mood swings, I guess.\n\nMood swings? Are you triggered by something?\nIt could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know?\n\nWhen was the last time you had a mood swing?\nOh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today.\n\nReally? How did you fool around with me?\nAngry.\n\nHow hard is it?\nYeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know?\n\nDo you think you're going to be able to control it?\nNo. Okay.\n\nHow are your best friends?\nMy best friends? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay.\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nThe goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially.\n\nCan you give me an example of that?\nOh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted.\n\nThat's great. Thank you. Is that even your address?\nYeah. Yes.\n\nCan you give me an example of that?\nOh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay.\n\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nWell, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then.\n\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nTo do what?\n\nWhen was the last time you were in the house?\nI don't know. Today. Happy to be here.\n\nThat's great. What are some things that you really put into your life?\nUm, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah.\n\nWhat would you say is something you've best followed in?\nMy best qualities? Just that, uh, qualities. Just that I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What do you mean by qualities? What comes to your mind? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay.\n\nI think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay, bye. Can I take her home with me? Is she, um, is she supposed to be a psychiatrist or can I hire her? Okay.",
         "Okay, so, looking back, I think I've dealt with some stuff, especially when I was younger. As a teenager, around 14 or 15, I remember being very restless and destructive. I even went to rehab after doing some time, but I ended up escaping and going back to jail. Lately, I feel like I'm not moving forward as fast as I want to, and it's hard. It's like I have mood swings – I can snap over something small. It happens all the time, even yesterday or today. It's related to anger, and I struggle to control it, especially when I'm dealing with unpleasant things in my life. My friends see me as outgoing and humorous, but they know I have my issues and understand when I get mad easily. I'm proud of the goals I've accomplished lately, like getting my GED and my job at LAX, but I regret some of the decisions I made when I was younger, like not staying in school and joining a gang. If I could give myself advice from 10 or 20 years ago, it would be to stay in school and control my anger.",

         "Okay, so now I'm going to start at the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and then when she's done she'll let you know.\nI'm going to put the doorbell back over here and then you can let me know when you're finished.\nYou can just ring the doorbell when she's done talking.\nYes.\nFine, thank you.\nMontreal, Canada. I moved here with my mom when I was in high school.\nYes. Oh, it's very cold there in the winter and our summers are very short.\nIt was very easy. I custom pretty quick.\nNo, not very much anymore. I don't have much family in the United States. It's pretty expensive to go back home so I only go every couple of years.\nMeeting different people, different places, different customs. Well, we just recently went to San Francisco, same custom and everything, but the city was very different and I enjoyed it.\nI took general education and child development. Right now I work part-time for an independent auto repair shop.\nI'm a very good driver.\nJust working with people, talking to people.\nNo. I'm shy sometimes so I stay to myself a lot.\nI walk along the beach, bike riding.\nArrogant people. I try not to get angry but sometimes I do try to learn. I'm learning to walk away from things but sometimes people provoke you. I'm getting better. I'd say 75% under control.\nAbout a month ago with my daughter and her finances. It's really hard. You don't like arguing with your children.\nI have two girls. One is 23 and one is 26. One lives in Louisiana and one lives here. Now that they're older, yes.\nSatisfaction of giving love to someone else.\nWorry. Well, unfortunately when I was young my sister was kidnapped so when my children were growing up I worried about them a lot and I didn't let them do things a lot on their own. Now it's easy because they're grown and they live on their own so it's a lot easier now but you still worry even though they're grown.\nI'm sorry, what did you say? Oh my goodness, they're spoiled rotten. They have everything.\nWaking up when my kids were younger on Christmas Day I loved it.\nNo.\nYes.\nIt's been exactly two years and two months.\nLoneliness, depression, especially after I didn't have any family members left in the United States so I went to counselor and then the group therapy.\nYes. I mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your likes, your dislikes, your problems and sometimes somebody else is going through the same thing you are and you can share what you're going through and what can help make it better.\nHow has seeing a therapist affected you? It's affected me a lot. It's helped me cope with things. It's nice to have somebody else to talk to.\nYes, I didn't want to admit it but after a while and feeling depressed for so long I knew I had to do something.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Pretty good.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just getting more positive, better.\nThat's good. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's not. It's about 50-50. Some nights I sleep good and some nights I don't.\nThat sucks. What are you likely to do to improve on? Lack of energy the next day.\nHow hard is that? It's hard, especially if you get two nights in a row of no sleep.\nWow. When was the last time you felt really happy? During the holidays, so a couple of weeks ago.\nHow did you feel about the holidays? I felt good. Holidays always try to, you know, Christmas trees and kids and everything. So usually is a good time makes me feel good.\nNice. What are you most proud of in your life? I was married and raising two children and having two kids. I'm very proud of that.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoy. Wow.\nThat's great. Thanks. How did you decide to decide? Well, I went from full-time to part-time work and there's not as much work in the automotive field. So I decided to go back to school.\nEasygoing, fun, easy to get along with. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mom. She's raised four kids single-handedly and was a very hard worker.\nOkay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't give up. Be positive and anything you try to accomplish, Ken, you can do it.\nIs that anything you regret? Not going back to school sooner.\nHave you done anything to avoid it? No, because I was raising two kids by myself. So now that they're grown, I have no excuse. So I'm doing it.\nThat's good. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm friendly. I'm a hard worker and most of the time I'm easy to get along with.\nCan you tell me about that? Like I said, I'm a hard worker. If you give me work to do, I'll do it. Most of the time I'm in a good mood so I'm easy to get along with.\nWhat are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Like I say, bike riding or walks on the beach. The beach is very relaxing.\nThat's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome.\nGoodbye.",
         "For the past two years and two months, I've been dealing with loneliness and depression. It started after I didn't have any family left in the United States. I decided to seek help and went to a counselor and then to group therapy. I really enjoy group therapy because it allows me to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. Sharing our problems and solutions has been helpful. Therapy in general has affected me a lot and has helped me cope with things, and it's nice to have someone to talk to. I didn't want to admit I needed it at first, but I knew I had to do something. Lately, I've been feeling pretty good, more positive. I still go to therapy. Sleep is still a struggle, about 50-50. Some nights are good, others aren't. The holidays always make me feel good, with the Christmas trees and the kids.",

She's gonna chat with you for a bit. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm gonna give you the doorbell again so you can hear her. So we're okay? She's pretty. Do we know who she's modeled on? Yes, I'm okay with this. How are you doing today? Very good. That's good. Where are you from originally? LA. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? It's sunny and it's near the ocean. The traffic can make it difficult to drive around between different places. And there's a lack of open spaces if you're not near the beach. No. I haven't finalized any travel plans. Listen to music. Yeah. Why? Well, I tend to excel at things that have to do with spending time alone versus things that have to do with spending time outside with lots of people. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm reasonable. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? Maybe yesterday I was trying to figure out how to pack something into the car. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm very good at it. What do you do when you're in love? I breathe in and out like that. Okay. That's good. What are some things you like to do with time? Like jogging, walking, bicycling, reading, listening to music. Music. Awesome. What did you study at school? Math, engineering, computers. Are you still working on that? A little bit, yeah. What do you do now? I'm a student. I'm going back to school for biological sciences. That's not interesting. How did you decide to do that? I started doing some reading on some textbooks. Okay. What's your dream job? Medical doctor. Really? How hard is that? I guess it depends on what type of medicine you practice. I understand. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I have a mentor. I have a lot of positive thoughts and suggestions. How do you know them? So I met someone through a class and then they worked with them professionally. So it's, I guess you could say through an academic or professional channel. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I can't think of one at the moment. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I don't think so, no. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Okay. I didn't understand any changes in your behavior or thoughts or anything. No. Do you feel down? Sometimes. Can you tell me about that? What do you wanna know? Whatever comes to your mind. Well, I think sometimes I do think about challenges ahead of me. And I can be a little daunting and I feel down. That sounds really hard. It is very hard. How do you cope with that? Go for a walk, read a book, listen to some music. Are they triggered by something? I don't, I mean I'm sure they are. I'm not specifically sure what triggers anything. Maybe feeling overwhelmed or not feeling particularly tied to some task. Is going to a therapist helping you? I don't go to a therapist. Okay. How are your best friends describing you? Reasonably smart, inquisitive and curious. How do you know them? I guess through classes. How close are you to them? Somewhat. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Patience and curiosity. That's good. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. A day ago. No.",

         "Okay. Yes. Very well.\n\nThat's good. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was about. Probably took a year or two. Well, you know, being away from my family, being away from what I was used to in New York, the neighborhoods, the people, and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here.\n\nWell, the weather. Can't beat the weather. It's generally always nice. It's not too hot. It's not too cold. It's creative. I do like movies. I like the beach. The traffic. There's a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here and more distant and unfriendly than other places.\n\nI was a history major.\n\nI do demonstrations in high-end supermarkets.\n\nTo be a screenwriter. That's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. It's hard because I don't always maintain focus and motivation. I let other things distract me.\n\nI've always been interested in films ever since I was a child. I just always was writing and had an active imagination.\n\nIn the last probably almost ten years I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well, I've always traveled, even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So, yes. Seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am. Seeing how they live and taking in the sights. I went to Kenya. That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on. On the safari and just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible. Oh yeah, that's one of the great experiences of my life. I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called Charmel Shake, which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world, which is hard to believe that Egypt would, but it was just amazing. I didn't go scuba diving. I went snorkeling.\n\nWhat do I do to relax? I like to listen to music. I like watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of whatever might be on my mind. I do meditate every day. I like to take walks in nature that's always calming, especially down by the ocean.\n\nIt depends. Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper. A lot of times I'll do a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself, which is something I've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. Also, since I meditate, I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past. Some things that make me really mad. I guess I think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along and make the world better.\n\nWhat was the last thing you argued with someone? Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film and I didn't think it was done very well. We had a fun argument about the movie. That just happened yesterday, so that's on my mind.\n\nIs there anything I regret? Is there anything I regret? Yeah, there have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued them. Certain jobs. When I first got to Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to become a GRIP and I probably should have pursued that.\n\nHow did I decide to do that? I don't really understand the questions. Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important and no matter how you feel, you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do.\n\nNo, but I've been depressed in my life. For the most part, I've been feeling good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. Sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down. I can usually get out of it pretty quickly. Sometimes financial concerns, sometimes an opportunity, how do I explain it? Financial is one way that if I made another decision, I might have more money or my life would be different.\n\nNot really. I feel pretty much the same.\n\nWhat got me to seek help for? Let's come back to that. Generally, talking to someone has helped when I did do that.\n\nPretty easy. I don't have problems sleeping. Usually I'm grumpy. If I don't sleep well, I feel tired and irritable.\n\nHow would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier.\n\nI think it's tough, it depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write, so that means that I have to spend time alone. When I come out of that, I'm extroverted. I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood.\n\nMy best qualities. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likeable personality. People have said that. I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's a cool detachment. I'm creative, intuitive.\n\nYes. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy. I had breakfast, I was happy. Sun was shining.\n\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I do remember snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun, the powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond, almost beyond like human in a way. Just more in touch with everything, the universe. It would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day, but...\n\nWhat am I most proud of in my life? I think I've helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, I've written some screenplays, I've had some good relationships. Good relationships, just being connected with someone else, spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels.\n\nIt could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something. If I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive, it puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye bye.\n\nSometimes she would ask me, it would sort of tweak, and then it would ask me this question about not being able to do it. I don't remember it really getting specific like that. Oh, like what? Do you remember what question you're talking about? It kind of asks me, well, are you depressed? Sometimes. It will explain that, and then it was like, well... Then it did something, and then it was like, well... Did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, we... There was no bridge to that conversation. Got it, got it.",
         "Okay, so, I have experienced depression in my life, though for the most part, I feel good. I do sometimes feel a little blue, especially if I let regrets creep into my mind, like missed opportunities. I can usually pull myself out of it pretty quickly, though. Financial worries can also get me down, making me think about how different my life might be if I'd made different choices. Talking to someone has been helpful in the past when I felt down. My friends probably wish I was a little happier and more accomplished in achieving my goals.",

About 16, 12 years ago, something like that. That's a long time. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It was pretty hard, you know, different environment. I had to learn different things, so. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather, there's a lot to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Too many people. Okay. How often do you go back to your hometown? I guess whenever I can. When was the last time that happened? Two years ago. Cool. How close are you to your family? We're pretty close. That's so good to hear. Do you travel a lot? Nah, not at all. Why? I just don't really have the time and the cash. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Not nothing, not really. Nothing really makes me that mad anymore. Really? Yeah. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm very good at controlling my temper. That's great. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Not really sure when was the last time. I say maybe, I'm not really sure, but it was just about money. What do you do to relax? I read the Bible. There's some of the positive influence in your life. What do you do to relax? I really don't have anyone right now. I really can't think. Okay, okay.

No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Sleepy. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? In my behavior, they got better. Tell me more about that. I started going to, I gave my life to the Lord, started going to church, so I'm just trying to do the right things now. How did you decide to do that? Because I knew that I needed to, and life was just not the way it should be. I see what you mean. How have you been feeling lately? A whole lot better. That's good. What would you say are some of the best qualities? I'm good to hang around, you know, I like to make people laugh, and I look out for people, take, you know, not just for myself, but others and things like that. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I just went to Disneyland with my son for his birthday, and my daughter, I really enjoyed that. That's good. How close are you to being a mother and a parent? Yes. What's the best thing about being a parent? That you see someone that looks like you, and you get to raise them, and try to make sure they do the right things, and be better than what you were. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Knowing that how evil the world is, and your son has to live in it. How hard is that? It used to be hard, but with prayer and faith, everything's gonna be all right. That's good. When do you think it's gonna get good? They're very fast. Tell me more about that. When we were growing up, things was different, you know, but now the world is just way worse off than what it is, than what it was. What's one of your most memorable experience? Flying in the airplane for the first time. Cool. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I was nervous, because I've never been on a plane before, so. How did you feel in that moment? Felt a little nervous, scared, you can say. I'd love to hear about when you're trip. Yeah, this one, I flew back home, you know, visited home, went back for about a week or two, seen my family, hadn't seen them in a couple of years, so that was pretty cool. Okay. What do you study at school? Right now, college, I'm studying, I want to be a culinary arts, so I want to be a chef. Awesome. How did you decide to do that? I like cooking, so I just decided to just go ahead and, you know, get an education on it. Are you happy you did that? Yeah, I'm happy. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud that I made a decision to serve the Lord and do the right things. Last night. Just because it's like I know that everything's gonna be all right, and I have no more worries, so I'm happy. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Cooking. Cooking puts me in a good mood and seeing that my kids are happy, that's cool. Is there anyone you regret? I'm not gonna regret it. Nope, can't say I regret anything. I really don't know. No prob, bye-bye. I feel like someone's really asking me questions.",
         "I have not been diagnosed with depression, but I can say that my life wasn't always the way it should be. Lately, I've been feeling a whole lot better because I gave my life to the Lord and started going to church. I knew I needed to make a change, and I'm trying to do the right things now. Making this decision has made me feel like everything's going to be alright, and I have no more worries.",

         "Okay, thank you.\nI'm Ellie, thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions and get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this?\nSure.\nOkay, so how are you doing today?\nI'm doing fine, just a little tired.\nWhere are you from originally?\nCalifornia.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nUm, the weather.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nFear of earthquakes.\nI see what you mean. What did you study at school?\nPsychology.\nCool, are you still working on that?\nI am, I go to Harbor College.\nAre you happy you did that?\nI am. I wish I would have went sooner, but better late than never.\nYeah, what's your dream job?\nProbably I'm not sure, I never really thought about it. I want to work in the field of psychology. But I'm not sure if I want to work with children or adults. So I haven't really decided.\nOkay, do you travel a lot?\nNo.\nWhy?\nI don't know. I just don't. Maybe once a year.\nWhen was the last time you traveled?\nJune actually, I went to Orlando, Florida.\nAwesome, do you consider yourself an introvert?\nSometimes.\nBut not as relaxed I'm sorry What do you do to relax?\nWatch TV, read a book, talk on the phone.\nWhat are some things that make you really mad?\nMad?\nMy mom gets in my business. Other than that, I guess just frustrations with my son.\nDo you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo.\nWhat's the hardest thing about being a parent?\nThe hardest thing is raising a child with a disability. Not knowing how you can help him.\nThat sounds really hard.\nIt is, it's very hard. I don't sugarcoat it at all.\nWhat's the best thing about being a parent?\nJust having my children, they're a blessing, I love them. With all the good and the bad, it's a part of me. I just love the fact that I'm helping mold them into good human beings.\nHow close are you to your family?\nWe're really close. My family's small, we live within blocks of each other. But yeah, we're close.\nOkay What's one of your most memorable experiences? Good or bad. What comes to your mind?\nMost memorable? Just giving birth for the first time. It was just amazing. My son is nine now, so I still remember it like it was yesterday.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nLike I was being born again myself. I don't know how to explain it. It's just very emotional.\nOkay Is there anything you regret?\nI don't know. I guess I have a lot of regrets. But none that I really want to mention. I guess I understand.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nStay in school. Don't get emotionally involved. And let people deter you from your goals.\nHave you done anything to avoid it?\nOh yeah, definitely.\nDid you want me to... I'm okay I'm okay, I mean, I'm pretty easy going. For the most part I don't really have a temper per se. Things frustrate me more than they anger me.\nWhat's the last thing you argue with someone?\nOh, that's easy. With my mother, she's like I guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to socialize. She feels that I'm married with children. So I should stay at home like 99% of the time. And I wanted to go out and socialize with some ex-co-workers. And she basically kind of put me down for it. As if I don't spend enough time with my children. It does. And I love my mom. I hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her. Because I always think, gosh, I don't want to get mad at her. And then something happens to her the next day. But she gets kind of intrusive, I don't know.\nWhen was the last time you felt really happy?\nOh, I know. After the semester ended when I noted that I did well in school. Because it had been a long time since I went to school. So when I received my grades, A and a B, I was like, wow, okay I can do this. And it made me happy. And that was about a few weeks ago, I guess.\nThat's great.\nThank you.\nThere's some of it that's been impossible to do. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life.\nMy mom, I know, it's good and bad. I mean, for the most part, my mom's been a positive influence. You know, it's just sometimes, you know, she gets a little Like she wants to re-raise me or something Like she doesn't understand that I'm an adult I'm going to make my own decisions now. Pretty much have to let me do what I need to do. A lot of heavy breathing I mean, I walk sometimes when I get a little frustrated Whatever, I'll just go take a walk You know, or just try not to think about it.\nThank you.\nYes.\nYes, the Navy.\nI was 19.\nYeah, yes.\nI didn't have any other options.\nI am, I probably should have stayed in a little longer. I was only in for four years, but You know, I wanted to experience life outside the military So I did my enlistment and then I got out. It made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that You know, did not join the military. I could notice a big difference as far as, you know, how I lived my life and how they lived theirs. Just made me a little bit more responsible.\nThank you.\nI worked in the medical field for about five years.\nAnd, oh, thank you. But it wasn't for me, I wanted to do something a little bit different. I didn't want to do patient care. I wanted to work with people, but not necessarily as a patient care provider. So I started going to school and then I met my husband. I stopped going to school. Got married and I started working in the telecommunications field. And then we, you know, conceived our child and after that You know That's it.\nI think I'm caring, well, I know I am, I'm very caring. You know, I'm very honest to a fault sometimes. You know, I try to be as honest as possible with people. Sometimes it can hurt their feelings, but You know, you gotta be honest. You can't let people think that, you know, you're not trusting. And if Yeah, probably, I never really thought about it. I don't know. Maybe, I don't really think about it. I just try to be the best person that I can be. You know, so That's all I can do, I can't live for what other people think. I can only do what I need to do.\nI don't know. I never really thought about it. I guess it's just, you know, being around my kids. You know, I just love being around my children. That always puts me in a good mood.\nThank you.\nOkay, like I said, a little tired, you know, but You know, for the most part, okay. You know, dealing with situations different Well, I go to bed really early, so As long as I go to bed early, I get a good night's sleep. But I wake up early as well, so It's kind of like Get in bed a little bit, I go to bed at like 8, 8.30 And then I wake up at like 1, 1.30 So Very moody Very irritable, short tempered, I guess. If you're a little bit more sensitive If anything, I think I'm thinking more positively You know, like I said, especially with my son having a disability You know, I look at it as if You know, it's not all bad I mean, he has challenges But I'm dealing with them a lot better You know, as opposed to feeling sorry for him Or feeling sorry for myself You know, I'm just finding more avenues to work with him You know, different resources to help him As opposed to just feeling guilty or sad or depressed about it.\nThank you.\nNo.\nOccasionally.\nWho does it?\nWhat color is your best friend?\nI don't know, can we skip that question?\nWhat color is your best friend?\nGreen. Seems to be the word, kind of like Yeah, probably green, like Naive a little. But at the same time, smart. I think she'll describe me as smart.\nThank you.\nOkay.\nNo problem.\nBye.\nOh, I'm sorry, I gotta push the button. It was fine, I kind of skipped one question though.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nI wouldn't say I'm currently depressed, but I have dealt with feeling guilty, sad, or depressed about my son's disability in the past. Now, I'm actively trying to think more positively and find resources to help him instead of dwelling on negative emotions. I also get very moody, irritable, and short-tempered when I don't get enough sleep. I go to bed early, around 8 or 8:30 PM, but I also wake up very early, around 1 or 1:30 AM.",

         "Okay. From here from Alhambra. The weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. What are some things you don't really like about the weather? Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Is that amazing? How did you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? Yes. What are you doing now? I'm a photographer. Nice. What's your dream job? Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. Okay. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. I see. How do you like your living situation? It's fair. It's not the greatest. Because of being an apartment manager, I do have free rent, but I have to stay there a lot. That's tough. That part does. The free rent part is very good. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Oh gosh. My most memorable experience. That's hard to say. Well, I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. What else do you like? Oh, well I guess some sports success when I was in high school. There were a few things that I was happy about. And some art pieces I've made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death. Those are very memorable and not good though. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters. So my family. How close are you to your family? We're fairly close. Most of them live around in LA. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. Wow. When do you think of the music? Mostly very talented. Just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. Seems like they were all hooked into social media. What do you do to relax? I go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. And I... Well, there's some kind of injustices that happen. Not big deals, but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend. And when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it. And we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set up time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up. When they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that part is upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up at the office. They just need to please the school to maintain the account. So often when that something like that happens, it means they will not send you out to work at that school again, which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. That's how they do things. So that is upsetting. How do you cope with that? Most of the time I dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that might be better. That's good. Yeah. How are you at controlling your company? Pretty good. I usually might, in the moment I don't really lose it, but later I might vent or something like that. But on the location I wouldn't do that. When was the last time you argued with someone? Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. I have a friend that I'm sharing the car with today. We were arguing on where to go first. So we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And then after this was one of the things is over, then we're going to do some more of her things. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Is that what that is? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I'd say 1980. Yeah, I believe it was 1980. What got you to see the doctor? My father noticed some symptoms. My father passed away, but he was a psychiatrist. What were your symptoms? Well, I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon. And I didn't have a focus like for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all part of depression. Yeah. Isn't it that you had a problem before you found out? Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? Well, I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done. But I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. What sort of changes have you noticed since you came on the field? I think therapy makes you see what the... I thought of it as a filter or wearing a... As if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really... You see everything through that. So you have to... I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately? Or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. How have you been doing lately? I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I've noticed in my past. Right now we have a work slowdown. So it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule is too wide open. For me personally as a depressed person, I think that structure is really important. It gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere on time and interact with people. Those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed. I think I've noticed any changes in your behavior. Well, I don't know if it changes a little bit. I tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting let's say. But it's more negative. I have been thinking about how soldiers in the past, I don't know why, but during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been like to be in a front line battle with crude weapons and no medical help. I don't know. My mind seems to go there a lot where I'm just thinking about that. I've been looking at and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube and things like that. Or some other kind of like terrible doom type things like I was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that. Where I probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. Oh, you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not finishing college. I think I was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well. I didn't get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years. So that's a big regret that I have. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I think it would have been to, at certain points, I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals, just the logistics. I was an art major and I had no car. So a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and also to meet at away locations. I think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time. What would you say as somebody who has holidays? Well, I've been told I'm very patient and also I have some original artistic ideas. So those are good qualities. I'm very loyal and also I support my friends. I'm fairly generous with them. Tell me about something you really enjoyed. Let's see. Let's see, I really enjoyed it. I had a nice experience just photographing a soccer game recently. I really enjoyed that. I love listening to you talk. Okay, I think I've answered everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. It's my pleasure. Thank you, goodbye. Yeah, that was very interesting. So I'm going to go to the top and then if you want to go back to the other computer.",

         "Okay. So now I'm going to start the virtual human app and I'll hand you the doorbell when you're done. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in the same sense of their environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'd like to get your questions started. And please feel free to comment anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with that? Yes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay.\nWhy did you move to LA? This was 30 years ago. My cousin went out here and said, I might as well go. Nothing happening here in Jersey City. I got to come out. That was in 19...\nHow was it to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Just like you find your nine-to-five job to pay the rent and a lot of things to do here.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? Probably the film industry and the celebrities and the glamour and excitement. I fit in real good.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, just like probably the homeless problem. You've got to see the derelicts and they eat out of the garbage. We're the homeless capital of America. You've got to see this all over the place. Yeah. I see what you mean.\nWhen did you study at school? I just graduated high school, but I have an interest in writing.\nWhat made you decide to do that? I have an interest in reading and words and creating stories and being imaginative. I haven't written anything in a while. That's my drug. I don't drink or smoke or do any kind of drugs, but writing was always what got me high. That's good. Yeah. But I haven't been inspired. I recently just met a young girl who's a stand-up. Her routine is so interesting. I could write a novel of her routine.\nTell me about that. Oh. I don't know. Actually, Facebook, she told us all this stuff about how she's friends with a homeless woman and a homeless woman can inherit $4 million if she gets off the street. And she has an autistic sister who's very strange, but is crazy about guys. And she's like 20 and wants to be a comic, and she's really talented. I've been Facebooking her, but she hasn't responded.\nOkay. You can believe it's all an introvert? Yes.\nWhy? What does introvert mean? Well, do I keep everything inside of me? Probably. And I'm always thinking probably all the time. Thinking about my problems and just too much analyzing. Yeah.\nWhat are some things that would be really nice? Probably lazy people, people just living off the government and going to get their Section 8. They just don't go out and just work and fend for themselves and take care of themselves. Just people who are so lazy. And some that go, they walk around, they're in the traffic with their signs, give me money, please help me, please help me. Help yourself. Help me, help me. That's what makes me mad.\nWhat do you do when you're annoyed? I try to just deal with it. Because I don't like being annoyed or angry. I don't really curse that much. I try to just stay calm, intelligent. So I just try to deal with it and suppress it and work through it.\nHow are you at controlling your anger? I'm okay. But lately I have had outbursts and I regret it. Only probably due to lack of sleep or just the tension that's rising and problems going on. But I try to just stay calm.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? And what were you about? Oh, oh wow. I don't like to argue, but I was arguing with a girl who was working at a movie theater and she was giving people wrong directions on which line to stand on. And she was causing like hassles. And I was saying, you know, they have to stand over here and don't send them over there. They won't get into the film screening. And there was some argument going on. And of course I was in the right. She was giving wrong information. This was at Grumman's Chinese Theater.\nOkay. How close are you to your family? Well, I do have a twin brother that I live with, but we don't get along with total opposites. I have a sister I haven't seen or talked to probably in 18 years. I have a younger brother. Don't see him much. And what's sad, I just have a mother who's still around. She's like 70, 75. Probably in the last three years, there's no communication, no phone calls, no Facebooking. Just separated. It's like we don't interest each other.\nWhy? Just the way that she's always, I don't know. I never had a father. The father left when I was four. She's always been a housewife. She's always been on welfare and food to dams. I just never really worked. I just wish she did something more. I do love her. We don't have a relationship anymore. I understand.\nThere's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Who's been a positive influence? Probably good writers. Probably some of my favorite authors who inspire me to write better.\nCan you speak to that? I don't know. I like the writer like William Goldman. He's a very good writer. He wrote Marathon Man and he writes about how to write screenplays. He wrote The Princess Bride. He's been an inspiration.\nNice. What do you think is the new kid? What was that? What do you think of today's kids? Today's kids? Oh, I can answer that with three words. Two aspects. There's just too much video games, too much technology, too much skateboarding. In the 70s when I grew up, we were locked in rooms or sitting in front of screens for hours and hours and hours. This is 2013. Life is hard for everybody and everyone's just trying to get through it. It's tough.\nHow would your best friend describe you? Generous and funny and fun to be with. Just an all-around great guy.\nHave you ever served in the military? No.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Yes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed? Six years ago.\nWhat got you into health? I probably went to a free clinic. Things were bad. I was probably interested in medication. Then when they offered it to me, I decided not to deal with it. I don't want to take medication or anything. I was taking Lipitor for high cholesterol and getting too much side effects, fatigue and sleeplessness and dizziness. I won't take medication.\nDid you think you had a problem before you found out? I'm a creative person. I've just suffered depression probably all my life. I have my highs and my lows. Just feeling blah. Walking around and just not feeling anything. Not feeling good about anything or excited about anything. Bored. So bored all the time.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Lately, I've never felt so bad in my entire life. Probably the last few years have just been really bad. I'm in survival mode. I'm sorry you're doing that. It's pretty bad.\nHave you noticed any change in your living here in the country? Change. I've just become a boring person. I go to all these free events all the time trying to save money. I'm out every night. I'm rarely at my home. I'm out all the time. Going to events, having a good time then. But it's like I'm just trying to shut out life. I live in movie theaters just trying to just block everything out. That's not good.\nDo you still go to therapy now? No.\nWhy don't you stop? I wasn't really into therapy. He was a Korean guy who said, yeah, you're depressed. You have suffered depression. I may be bipolar, but I'll deal with it.\nHow easy is it sleeping in a good night's sleep? Believe it or not, if it's just dark and quiet, I'll sleep pretty good. Eight to ten hours. Sometimes, because I snore, sometimes I'm not allowed to sleep. Sometimes I get kicked out of the apartment. It's a small apartment. I've slept on alleyways. I've slept in doorways just to experience it. I'm not homeless. That's when I can't sleep. That's when I get two or three hours. There's your answer. Inside, I can sleep okay. Because I'm always fatigued. I'm very tired, and I'm a heavy snorer. I snore like a chainsaw. They have it.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? Whew. I'm okay. People can tell. I'm just drowsy. Probably irritable. I just want to let darkness come. Let me just get at least four, five, six. Some sleep at all, please. If I get some, then I'll be okay.\nOkay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I had a gambling addiction. I messed my whole life up. I pretty much lost everything. When was the last time I was happy? I probably took $60 to a casino. Turned it into $1,200. I had $1,200 in my pocket. It was exciting. Of course, the next few days, $1,200 was liquidated. It went because I was stupid and got greedy. That's when I'm happiest. Go to a casino and win or just stay even and not lose anything. That's where my adrenaline is.\nHas that gotten you in trouble? Yes, it has. It put me where I am today. Too much blackjack. It's bad. Otherwise, in the past three years, I've had... No, not much. The gambling is not worth it. In the end, you lose everything. Yeah. Apology accepted.\nWhat would you say of somebody who has followed you? I am generous. I'm a nice guy. I'm not going to do you wrong. I'm very reliable. All-around good guy. I'll help you out. I'll lend you a few dollars. I think I'm all right.\nNothing in your debt? No, nothing at all.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I just hope that there is a second chapter in my life at my age. Right now, I'm just floundering, killing time. It's probably been four years now of nothingness.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Manage your money better. I would never think I would have six figures in the bank, but I did. It evaporated very slowly. The advice is probably just don't gamble. Keep your money. Try to find some other means of excitement. For me, being at that blackjack table with big wages was my reality. That reality was better than being outside the casino. My reality was right there. At Texas Hold'em, I did okay. I didn't lose much. I'm a pretty good player. Blackjack, it just took everything.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life? That I had those 12 years. I owned a casting company for 12 years. I provided people for movies and television shows. A lot of audience work. I made a lot of money for 12 years and traveled. I had the time of my life. At least on my deathbed, I can say from 1996 to 2008, I had a lot of money. I had 12 years that I never thought I would ever have. Money, money.\nWhat is something you really enjoyed? That I really enjoyed. My excitement is getting into a big movie premiere at the Gromit. You know, you get the tree and you get the popcorn and soda and you see the stars. That's about as exciting as it's going to get right now.\nAwesome. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Alright. Take care. Bye.",
         "I was diagnosed with depression about six years ago, but I think I've suffered from it my whole life. I'm a creative person, and I've always had my highs and lows, just feeling \"blah\" and bored. Lately, though, it's been worse than ever. I'm just in survival mode. I went to a free clinic and they offered medication, but I didn't want to take it. I don't like medication. I wasn't really into therapy either. The therapist just confirmed I was depressed and maybe bipolar, but I figured I'd just deal with it. To cope, I go to free events every night to shut out life, spending time in movie theaters to block everything out.",

         "Okay, great. So everything's all set up now. Sorry about that. No, it's okay. So if you just want to give me one second, I'll be right back. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Something's bound to happen, right? Of course. Let's start this again. So we'll just keep going. So I'm going to do something for our purposes. It's kind of spooky. All right. So whenever she's done, she'll let you know, and then you can press this button. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm here to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people's lives. And I'm going to be making a video about this. Okay. So I'm going to start the video. I'm here to learn about people, and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you two questions to get started. And please feel free to comment at me. Your answers are very confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So how are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I am from Los Angeles. I see. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? It's the center of everything. You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, being in LA also you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But you know, you live with that. I see. What did you study at school? I was a business administration major, so I studied business. And after I finished college, I pursued a career in retail operations. Are you still doing that? No, as a matter of fact, I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years. So I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. What made you decide to do that? A couple of factors. After working numerous years in the retail business, I switched over and worked in a creative business, which was a graphic design firm. And I captured a lot of knowledge in the human resources side because I was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a small company. Are you happy you did that? Yes, I'm very happy I did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it's very helpful. That's great. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? Well, my dream job is I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am an independent contractor. I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs. And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle, but I also enjoy what I do. I'm not under as much stress as I used to be. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not totally outgoing, but I'm not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle, maybe more towards outgoing, but I'm not totally outgoing. I mean, when I'm around other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself. Can you tell me about that? Oh sure. A couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had bypass operation and it had to do with stress and things like that. I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If I meet someone new I don't just openly say, well you know, I've experienced this, this, and this. I just basically, if it comes up I won't deny it, or if it comes up and I feel like it's something to talk about, I will talk about it. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom, my mother, and she's a senior citizen, she's alone. So what I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that. That's actually very therapeutic. How are you at controlling your hunger? I'm not a short-fuse kind of person. It takes a lot to get me really angry. So as far as my temper is concerned, there's not much to that. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? That sucks. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I had a slight chance it was going to help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point, or it would kill him. And that was really tough. It was a really tough decision to make. That sounds really hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My mother is a very good friend of mine. She has her issues, I have my issues, but we are not divorced. We were just separated. We still have a relationship where we still speak to each other. We just don't live together. And the relationship with my mother is really great. She's very understanding. She's 82 years old, so she likes having me around, which is good because she's in her later stage of her life. I guess it's good that in its own way, maybe fate has taken place because someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing. She feels comfortable with me there. I think there's a comfort level she feels with me there, especially being her only child. What's something you feel guilty about? Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things that I did to hurt my marriage. The things that I did, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah, I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had. We were growing apart. When she was away, my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. I spent a lot of time in the casinos. What eventually happened was I spent a lot of money. Obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship. It had to do with trust because it was devastating to my wife. How did you feel at that moment? When it came to light, I felt very guilty and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. I'm sorry. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not at all. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, not really. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping, so no. That's good. Do you feel down? No, not at all. Have you ever studied using an indicator of your health? No. The only thing I can say is after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. I tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that. That's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy? Probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I guess the number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight. In general, just be more healthier physically. As far as mentally, just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish. How do you cope with that? Just one day at a time. I try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch TV. I do things that I know that if I can help myself, I do things to help myself. Is there anything you regret? There's a lot that I regret, obviously. My marriage, my working career. I had a long career with this major food chain. Basically, because of my gambling issues, I ended up ruining a very good career. At this point right now, there's not much I can do. I can't change what's been done, so I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me every day. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself. Make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent, but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things, but deep down, I don't think as a person, I'm a bad person. I remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had an illness, a compulsive, obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill. That I was a sick person just trying to become healthy. Every day, that's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night, one day at a time. How hard is that? It's not as hard as you think, but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you. It could be okay for other people to do certain things, but I cannot do those things anymore. How would your best friend describe you? Most of my best friends describe me as probably easygoing, generous, a nice person to be around. They were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage, which is still not over yet. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning, around six o'clock. I go to a local park. This park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles, and I take a brisk walk in the morning, get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. Then after that, I go home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax, and then just kick back for the rest of the day. Then the next day, I do the same thing again. In the morning, I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch TV, whatever. Just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. Nice. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Okay. Lock yourself out. Okay. I actually got comfortable talking to you. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, that's pretty cool.",
         "Okay, here's my experience with depression. While I haven't been formally diagnosed with depression, I've definitely had struggles that have impacted my mental well-being. A few years ago, I had a heart attack related to stress. Looking back, I recognize that my compulsive gambling was a major issue. It stemmed from working long hours under a lot of stress and it became a way to cope. It led to significant financial problems and a breakdown of trust with my wife, ultimately contributing to the end of my marriage. I felt immense guilt and like less than a human being when the extent of my gambling came to light. I wouldn't say I feel \"down\" now, but I do have regrets about the pain I caused and the career I ruined. Now I focus on taking things one day at a time, trying to be at peace, meditating, and doing things that help me stay healthy and avoid those past behaviors. I think of it as a recovery process.",

         "Okay, great.\n\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nSo, how are you doing today?\nI'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay.\nWhere are you from originally?\nI was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast.\nWhy did you move to LA?\nOriginally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again.\nHow easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?\nIt's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nNot at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends. I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nDepends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy.\nOkay.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed.\nWhen was the last time that happened?\nA few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nI've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to really hit me.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nGood. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nLast night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about?\nA lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really wanted to work and I ended up and it was partly due to I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty tough.\nCan you have done anything to avoid it?\nWell some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have been it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were.\nI think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself.\nI mean it's possible. I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah.\nThat sounds really hard.\nWell it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by drinking and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's been better.\nThat's good. How do you cope with them?\nWell like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet.\nAre they triggered by something?\nThey're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to this. It's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nI'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep. I don't know. I get up, I toss and turn all night. You know and now it's yeah I don't sleep too great right now.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well?\nIt's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad.\nOkay. How long ago were you diagnosed?\nI think three, three, four years ago. It was when I had been given taken stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So yeah that was kind of a turning point. But unfortunately it happened after everything went bad.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nLooking back on it I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain and I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean I was paying a lot of money to go see doctors and they were doing they it didn't help it didn't work until I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little late now\nWhat got you to say help?\nThere really wasn't any choice I had to. I was a mess. It was either I was self-medicating or I was affecting my work everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I just had to make this different but again it was too late because then my review came up a few months later and after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. But it was at least that and not firing me. But so I got help but it wasn't soon enough. Not as much as I should.\nI go to a couple of meetings so that I can keep control of that aspect and there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately being unemployed my employment ran out I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. Somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. And then there's you.\nRight.\nJust saying stuff out loud is like getting the stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of drugs you're taking all that stuff that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can do. Something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing.\nIt's sort of it has its ups and downs. You know I'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a day and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to being self sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just I have to deal with real life which is It has its own challenge.\nYeah.\nIt can be tough to find a good job.\nYeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nIt was probably a couple of years ago. The thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job. I was making these great videos with this person that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree. And we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger bigger life that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and everything was going really well. I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So.\nWhat are you most proud of?\nProbably the educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about the world around them so that I feel like that was a really good thing to do. It was part of my job. It was an interesting life. We were trying to come up with new ideas for because we would put together videos and stuff to give to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of and so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it.\nOkay.\nI think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.\nThank you. Howdy. Bye.",
         "Okay, here’s a summary of my experiences with depression, from my perspective:\n\nI've been dealing with depression for a few years, though I was initially treated only for anxiety. Looking back, I'm angry because I feel like I lost everything – my job, relationships, my old life – due to a chemical imbalance in my brain that wasn't properly addressed. I sought help and saw doctors, but it wasn’t effective until I found a psychiatrist who correctly diagnosed me and prescribed the right medication.\n\nBefore that, things spiraled out of control, especially in a past relationship that I feel guilty about because I wasn’t medicated properly. Now, the medication helps me manage things. I still get upset and depressed, but I don’t completely lose it for days like I used to.\n\nI still struggle with dwelling on things, even things from high school. I used to self-medicate with alcohol to slow my mind down, but the medication has helped. I cope by constantly occupying my mind – watching TV while playing games, or using the computer while watching a show. My thoughts are triggered by everything, and it feels like I never get a break. I'm also a light sleeper, which doesn’t help.\n\nCurrently, I attend meetings for support and have access to a psychiatrist through the city, but only see her a few times a year to keep my medication coming. Talking about my feelings, even to a program like this, helps me process and externalize the mess in my head. The chemical parts of my depression are getting under control, but now I'm facing real-world challenges like unemployment and struggling to become self-sufficient again. I remember a time a few years ago when everything was going well, and I felt like a normal, happy person. I don't know if I'll ever feel that way again.",

         "That's true. Research shows that that's really beneficial. All right. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and stay and secure in my room. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you OK with this? Yeah, I'm OK with it. OK. So, how are you doing today? Um, I'm OK. I guess. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from LA. I'm basically an LA kind of guy. Cool. What are some things you really like about LA? Um, you know, the weather. It's usually pretty sunny and temporary. I like the climate really a lot. I like the girls here. I don't like the traffic, but I like the city. I like the Hispanic population quite a bit. And I have a lot of friends here, so I guess I don't want to be anywhere else. Uh-huh. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Like I said, the traffic. I was on the 405. That's always kind of crummy. The cost of living, that's really terrible about LA. It's always expensive. And it just seems like LA is one of those places where you either have a ton of money and fame and fortune or you're down in the ghettos. Yeah. Do you travel a lot? I have. I've been to a couple of places, but very brief, mostly for school. I went to Arizona and New York and Montana, a lot of anthropology and archaeology, field trips and things like that. Nothing I'm doing right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like getting away from the city. I was in Yosemite last year in the summer for vacation. That was kind of nice. Yosemite was really neat to see. But just basically getting away from the city, getting away from the job, getting away from the stress here. Yeah. What did you study at school? I actually studied political science and I also studied economics. I'm a big kind of political junkie, so I naturally kind of fell in line with that kind of field of study. Are you still working on that? I was, but I lost my job. And that's kind of a bummer. I lost it maybe a year and a half from now, maybe two years. The economy got bad, and the budget cuts got bad, and I wish I was working there again. Yeah. What's your dream job? Well, I wanted to be a lawyer at one time. I wanted to be a lawyer, and that's why I took political science, and I took a double major in economics. And the sad thing I regret is to get into law school, you have to take this entrance exam called the LSATs. And I studied really hardcore for about a year. And I took the CAD test, and like an idiot, I didn't feel right about that day. It was kind of an off day. And it was like the big game at the Super Bowl. I just don't feel like I did well. And I canceled the test, and so I kind of regret that. That sucks. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not really shy at all. I'm definitely not shy. But outgoing, I'm not flamboyant. I talk to people. I don't mind talking to people. I don't mind meeting people. That's fine with me, but it's not like I'm dying to meet anybody. Yeah. What do you do to relax? These days, I play guitar. I taught myself how to play guitar. I should actually be doing more of it. But I also like to exercise. I'm on a diet right now, but my diet's been terrible. Eating habits have been terrible. But the exercise part is just great. I love to exercise. I love to run. That's one of my best things to do for stress is run and work out. I just wish that my eating habits were a little bit better. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? My temper could be definitely improved a lot. A lot of times I feel I'm one of these introvert type persons. When it comes to I don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and having a good time, whatever. When I'm mad, I really don't want to be talking to people. I don't like to yell. I don't like to scream. I don't like to hit. I don't like to fight. I kind of close down a lot. I just want to be left alone. Sometimes I tend to drag it on for longer than it should be. The wife doesn't like it too much. Maybe I just don't want to talk about it. I just don't want to deal with it. I kind of close down and shut off for a little bit. Geez. It doesn't happen too often. Maybe with my wife, probably something silly. Who knows? Can you give me an example of that? Let's see. I guess sometimes I'm a married guy, but sometimes there are times I like to smile at a girl or get a girl's attention. I don't know. I never do anything about it. I never get the phone number or sometimes I like to talk to people, I guess. Well, that's a good question. I guess I always handle it the same. I don't ever wish to ever change it. I never want to handle things differently. I'm pretty comfortable the way I handle things. I think that it could be a lot worse than shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that, and that's just not me. I think the best thing to do is kind of get a lot of breathing room, a lot of space, and I don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently. I just don't basically know what else to do. And the last thing I want to do is start talking about feelings or any of this. That's the last thing I want to do. So I don't wish that I handle things like that differently in that way. Well, you know, I'm pretty happy with my family right now. I'm married and we have a baby along the way, which is kind of nice. We have some cats and a dog, a weenie dog. And my mom, I love my mom dearly. She has diabetes, which she doesn't control. She doesn't control it and it affects her health. It always has me worried about her and stressing out about her. She could do so much to prevent it and she doesn't. I have a good relationship with my mom. I love her dearly. And I actually have good relations with everybody, I think. I think I have a ton of family and friends that get along with me pretty well, actually. Yeah. There are times when it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep. Actually, I feel like I sleep like a baby. The only problem I have, I think, is I feel like sometimes you fall asleep and you have you're just going to sleep and you kind of like joke, you almost kind of like fall. It's like a falling sensation or something like that. It doesn't happen that often, but it happens. For the most part, I sleep like a rock. I sleep really good. That's good. What have you been feeling lately? Well, right now, generally, I've been feeling worried and anxious and tense. The reason why is because I said my mom, at least today, I found out my mom, she didn't tell me the whole story and I'm kind of waiting until this is over so I can find out what's wrong with her. I'm worried about her. She's in the doctors right now, so that doesn't tell me anything good. I'm trying to find a job. So that has me worried too. The baby along the way. So that has me worried. I feel overwhelmed with a lot of things to do and a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me, but I have to handle it. Yeah. How do you cope with them? Well, I keep myself distracted. I keep myself busy. I feel like a busy body, and the more which kind of seems like it's not a good thing because I feel like I'm just adding more things on my plate. One of the things I do is exercise. I have to work out every day, but that takes an hour to change and start running and go through the whole thing of stretching and cooling down. It takes some time and then to shower and all that kind of stuff takes time. I have to do it daily. So I cope with it in that way. I also cope with it playing guitar. That's just more of a distraction. Keeping busy that way. It just seems like it's not working towards the goals that I need to do is find a job, which I should be doing. It's one of those things where I find there's no good jobs. I've been looking and looking and sometimes when I do, it's just not what I want to do. It just doesn't seem like I want to do these terrible jobs. It's probably harder than I'm thinking about it because sometimes I feel like it is hard, but it's not. There are ways I can cope with it. I just got to kind of accepted it a lot, internalized it. It's not something that's I'm not out on the streets or anything like that. It is a worry. I've never been diagnosed with PTSD. The last time I was really happy, I feel like nothing makes me happy no more. I learned a new song on the guitar. I feel like not even happy about that. I work out. Sometimes that kind of makes me happy. Running like fast and working out. That doesn't make me so excited or anything like that. It just makes me feel good. I have these times where I'm feeling good about myself, but I'm never feeling great. I'm never feeling happy. I'm never feeling sensationalized. These are old times where there's a few good times and a few bad times, but the good times are never extremes, never really good times and never really atrocious bad times. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I wish this diet would work out a little bit better because I'm the kind of guy who just likes rice and Mexican food and snacks. I feel like that I could change. I wish I could change my eating habits that way. I can because I work out so much. I feel like I do so much running and so much activity that if I got my diet in check, that would go a long way. I wish I also can change my desire to get ahead right now. I feel just so like the economy is so bad and things are so rough that it's pointless to even look for these kind of jobs. I just wish I had a little bit more inspiration and a lot more motivation to do things. Is there anything you regret? The one thing I regret is this LSAT thing, not canceling the test to begin with, because I'm sure I could have gone into school. But then again, it has me thinking, do I really want to pay a bunch of law school tuition and the cost of that just to be powered down with more work and things like that? There is this idea of justice and republicanism and things that I really adhere to that I fall in love with that I don't want to get away from. It just seems like it's a ton of work and money just for the small percentage of success that you might not be able to do in that kind of field. It just doesn't seem like it's worth overcoming the obstacles I need to overcome. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I have no idea. 20 years ago. I would tell myself maybe I think I've done everything really well for myself, except for the LSAT thing, which I regret on one hand and the other hand, I'm not sure if I regret because of the bills and all that kind of stuff. I've waited to get married. I waited to have a kid. I've been pretty cautious about this. I don't take drugs. I don't drink. I don't fight. I don't do any of these things that I think that real people have and they really ruin their life. I'm pretty happy and content with being cautious. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? Oh, my best friend. I think he kind of likes me. He wishes that I would do more things with him, but he works at night. I think most people, not just my best friend, but my wife and my rest of my family feel that I don't put a lot of time and attention to them. I mean, they think that I'm pretty great when I do give them my time of day and my attention. I don't know if I'm really there all the time. I don't know if I'm really, I'm always thinking about something else. I'm always thinking about something different. I don't know if I really can give them a real shoulder to cry on or if they ask for something, I'll usually do it, but I almost feel like it's like a chore. If they really need me, then I'll do it. If they're just asking for a favor, I almost feel I do it with a lot of lackluster, a lot of half-hardness. It's not because I hate them or anything. I really like them. It's just that I feel like I almost I don't want to say I owe it to them, but the mere fact that I'm their friend makes them somehow like it makes me, they rely on me. In times like I don't want to let them down. They are my friends, but at the same time, I just feel like it's more of like a chore to do instead of a willingness. It's just something that I do because I kind of have to. You got to do things for your friends in the end because they're your friends. In the end I do like them and they probably would do it for me. So I just do these things. Well, there are a couple of things that I do like that I feel good about myself. I ran the LA marathon. That kind of feels good. I graduated from college. That kind of feels good. The thing is, I don't feel like that proud of myself for those things alone. Graduating from college hasn't really made me successful. Running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim. They're like half merits. They're great. A lot of people maybe not have done it. A lot of people have excelled further. They're kind of like stepping stones that I still will no life long benefit from doing other than the fact that I can say that I've done. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Yeah, no problem. Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy being in this computer. Thank you. Goodbye. Oh, goodbye. I'm going to press this button now. I think we're good here.",
         "Okay, here's my summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nLately, I've been feeling worried, anxious, and tense. A lot of it stems from my mom's health issues, which are stressing me out. Job hunting is also a major source of anxiety. The baby on the way adds to the feeling of being overwhelmed. I try to cope by keeping myself busy, exercising, and playing guitar, but it feels more like a distraction than a real solution. \n\nThe problem is, nothing really makes me happy anymore. Even when I achieve something, like learning a new song or having a good workout, the joy is fleeting. I feel good sometimes, but I'm never truly *happy* or excited. My life feels like a mix of okay times and okay-bad times, but nothing is ever extremely good or extremely bad. I wish I could feel inspired and motivated again. The last time I was really happy is so far back I can barely remember it.",

         "Okay. All right. Thanks. Go ahead.\n\nHow are you doing today?\nI'm okay.\n\nWhere are you from originally?\nI grew up in Wisconsin, and I lived in Colorado for a bit, and then I lived overseas for a little while, and then I moved to California.\n\nWhen'd you move to LA?\nJune of last year so I guess it's been eight months something like that.\n\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nAt the most probably twice a year.\n\nHow does it compare to LA?\nWell my hometown is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of LA.\n\nWhy do you miss LA?\nIt's a good question. I've always wanted to live in California but I had been living in the central coast and I just have been coming down to LA like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me. The client I had who was really the main financial source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I'll give LA a try and see what happens. So I gave it a shot and here I am.\n\nHow easy was it for you that you still live in LA?\nNo not at all. It's a very very big city. I lived in Dublin in Ireland which is also a big city but European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy. So just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging.\n\nDo you travel a lot?\nI love to travel. I lived in Ireland and I traveled. I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica. I spent some time in Mexico.\n\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nI love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures and also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go.\n\nI'd love to hear about one of your friends.\nSure. I'm trying to think which was my favorite. There's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days and we went to 3 different locations. We went up in the Atlas Mountains which are beautiful. It's a really really cool culture.\n\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nMy most memorable moment of that trip was being on a bus and leaving Dublin and going down to the countryside and seeing how breathtakingly beautiful it is. Everyone sees pictures of Ireland or you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experience it. The pictures don't do it justice.\n\nWhat did you study at school?\nI have an undergrad degree in English and Psychology and a psychology minor and I have a masters degree in Women's Studies.\n\nAre you still working on that?\nNo, I use my English and Psychology. I work in marketing communications. I actually do sales. The psychology definitely comes into play. I guess my undergrad degree in English but really I took that on and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I wasn't wanting to teach.\n\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nI guess I'm not clear on the question. Let's come back to that later. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me.\n\nWhat's your dream job?\nMy dream job is being a motivational speaker and trainer and coach and traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people.\n\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nMy relationship is pretty good actually. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother. She was sporadic. I saw her sporadically growing up. My dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with. I got in communication with my biological mother last May and we've cleared things up and have been in communication since then.\n\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nSometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screen saver. I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got.\n\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI love to dance. I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharges my battery actually. Probably more than anything else. I like to be with friends. I love art and trying new restaurants. All those things are both relaxing. I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life.\n\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nDepends. If I'm driving not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it.\n\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about?\nLast time I argued with somebody. Probably would have to be with the LA Times about the newspaper delivery. The newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of, it didn't show up. I didn't realize that it wasn't there until late afternoon. I think early afternoon. I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10.30 in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. For a service that would pay for it for every day. I was really irritated. I was angry with the LA Times. I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. It was pretty frustrating.\n\nTell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently.\nOh wow, there are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program. It was from one of the coaches in the program. She was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be, we have meetings every week, classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with. She called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach. That hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god I have all these people I have to be accountable to and I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people. I just was, I don't know. So, yeah, I wasn't angry. I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it. Yeah, I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother.\n\nThe hardest decision.\nWow, there's been a few. Moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision. No, it wasn't even the hardest decision. It was such an easy decision actually, but telling my family about it was challenging. The hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family. I was 28 and I decided to, I chose to move to Colorado. And that was a pretty tough decision. At that point my family had been within an hour's drive of wherever I lived, an hour, hour and a half, and now they're going to be a 12 hour drive away or a plane ride away. So that was challenging.\n\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nOh, lots of things. I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful, beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin. And at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado. So there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single. That was another factor. And were interested in the things I was interested in. So Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. So yeah, and then I found a job that I liked. The pay was atrocious, but I found some work that was really rewarding. So it all came together and I chose to move.\n\nThat sounds like a great situation. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nThat's a totally unrelated question. Relatively easily. It just depends on what time I go to sleep. If I'm out and I don't get home until 1130, then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today. But generally I can sleep through the night. I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks. But even so, even when I wake up from those or if I stir from those, I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily.\n\nAre they triggered by something?\nYeah, I'm sure they are. I'm in another transition state. I'm moving out of the house that I live in right now where I take care of an elderly woman. I have defined the financial means to support me in doing that. She creates a lot of anxiety in her state of being. She's exhausting and utterly depressing.\n\nHow hard is that?\nLiving with her is pretty hard. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done. I would never ever choose to do it again. Honestly, if I knew what I was getting into, I don't think I would have said yes to the situation.\n\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI feel trapped and helpless. There's no way out of the situation that I'm in. No matter what I do, it doesn't get any better. I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do. My money's not working at all. It feels pretty crappy.\n\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nI have in the past.\n\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nA long time ago. I was 15 or 14. It was over 20 years ago.\n\nWhat got you to see the outcome?\nI was suicidal.\n\nDo you feel down?\nOh yeah, I feel down.\n\nDo you still go to therapy now?\nI don't actually, no.\n\nWhy did you stop?\nI originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed. We had worked on what needed to be worked on. I was no longer depressed. Then I began therapy again later on. It was in my early 30s. Then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland.\n\nDo you feel like therapy's useful?\nYeah, depending on the therapist and depending on your intention. I don't go into therapy thinking, oh, I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years. I think that's ridiculous. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just that, not just creating a solution in that area, but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to worry about it.\n\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nLast time I felt really happy. That's pretty sad. It was at least a year ago. No, that's not true. It was when I saw my biological mother, which was last May.\n\nWhat would you say are some of your best qualities?\nMy best qualities. I'm strong, very strong-willed. I'm very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent.\n\nIs there anything you regret?\nAnything I regret? I don't think so. No.\n\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nDon't take life too seriously.\n\nTell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nOh, my ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends. Either going out a night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar, somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to... And then I have brunch with friends. I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day.\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nI am most proud of a few things. I've moved to places that I wanted to move to. I've done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something, been dear to my heart to actually achieve those goals or those... Yeah, I've done things that I've wanted to do, like move to Ireland and move to California.\n\nOkay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nSure. Goodbye. Bye. Just a little bit of a... Finish up with a quick post survey. So...",
         "Okay, here's my story regarding depression:\n\nI was diagnosed with depression a long time ago, when I was only 14 or 15. It was triggered by feeling suicidal. I did go to therapy then, and it was helpful. I stopped when I felt like we'd worked through the issues and I was no longer depressed. I went back to therapy again in my early 30s, but stopped when I moved to Ireland. I do think therapy can be useful, depending on the therapist and your own intentions. You go in to work on specific problems and find solutions, not to be in therapy for years.\n\nRight now, I'm feeling down. I feel trapped and helpless in my current living situation, taking care of an elderly woman. It's exhausting and utterly depressing. I feel like there's no way out, and no matter what I do, things don't get better. I'm not getting the work I want, and my finances aren't working out. It feels pretty crappy.",

         "She'll ask you some stuff, but yeah, she can understand. So when she's done, she'll let you know. I'll put the door up over here and hopefully it'll work. I'll try to sometimes assist in the thought of some of those. OK. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Boston. Really? When did you move to LA? About 30 years ago. That's a long time. Yep. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Oh, I love living in LA. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. Why did you move to LA? Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. The beginning of the first few weeks where it was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? Broadcast journalism. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. Are you still working on that? Nope. Why? Well, it's kind of a long story, but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just, once I had done that work, I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Yep. What's your dream job? My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Nice. How hard is that? Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to, I don't travel so much right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like where I'm from. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday. Cause I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international dateline. And I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part. And I got to be there for a whole weekend, just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you and it's amazing. It's just a beautiful, beautiful spot in the world. Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More shy. Why? That's a good question. Partly the first thing I think of is cause I've always been that way, but maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. So. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach cause I live close to the beach. So that's one of my favorite things to relax. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations, but not at people directly. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Not sure I have one at the moment. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That just makes me really mad. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. I didn't know that I could do it. I wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. So that felt like a really difficult decision, but in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time, it was really difficult to do that. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment. So that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm like great, but it's because I am worried. But I'm also confident that things are gonna work out. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either. Sort of like just a even keel. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, I got to go to my friend's work at the Motion Picture Academy. So I get to see all the Oscar nominated movies. How was it? She was there one night, so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again. So that was very pleasant. Nice. How would your best friend describe you? I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. Is there anything you regret? No, I really worked hard on that. I think there are lots of things maybe I would do differently, but there's nothing that really I regret. So what? Well, I just think that there are things that, like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good question. Don't worry about the small stuff and save more money. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, you know, the normal things, like I'd lose more weight than I would. I think be a little more fearless maybe. Be a little more bold. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't think I have any of those. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Well, I am self-employed, so I work all the time. So my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something I enjoy. So that would be ideal at this point, my weekends, if I were really busy. What are you most proud of in your life? That I've really been able to take care of myself and that I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do. I've done that. And I don't have regrets about things. There's nothing really that feels undone in my life. Sure, there's plenty of things I still wanna do, but I feel like I've done what I said I was gonna do. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, that's not so great. Well, it's okay. Both my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister, but they both live on the East Coast and I live in LA. And then my sister has two girls, so I feel very close to my nieces, although we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers, so they have other things on their mind. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my teacher. He's the person I learned my holistic body work from. I really like to model my work and my way of being after him. Like he's a good role model for me, the way he holds his work and the way he lives his life. That's so good to hear. How close are you to them? We're pretty close. We're not best of friends, but I know that I can call him anytime I need him. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or... Yeah, just spending time with my friends. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thanks. Goodbye. Bye. It worked again. That was where I was feeling... Okay, good. I'd like to hear that. Now I'm going to have you move over to the other computer so you can do a quick post survey about your experience.",

         "Okay cool. There I am. All right, thank you so much.\nI'm doing all right.\nYeah, from Maryland. Yeah, Maryland, Washington DC area like five weeks ago.\nIt's a lot less. It's not as nice this time of year. LA is a lot better though. There are a lot more people, a lot more going on. I guess I'm still getting used to it, it's coming slowly, but surely.\nI live in Culver City.\nI do.\nI have one. It's okay. I live in a really nasty house. It's cheap because I'm living in a friend's place and he's letting me stay there for half price, but the actual place itself is pretty horrible living conditions. But I'm moving soon.\nNo, I traveled. I would say I probably traveled more than most people in the US, considering that most people don't travel in the US. But I wouldn't call myself a world traveler. I enjoy the chance to get to see other walks of life and kind of like meditate on the specificity of my own. Given the parameters that I grew up under, like how different everyone else is, like how every life is totally. I mean, even just within the US, like seeing how someone in California grows up is so different from how someone in Maryland grows up. And then to think about someone in like Thailand or something growing up. It's pretty amazing.\nWell, it's been a while since I've been on a trip. I guess one of the last trips I did was to. A lot like two years ago, I went on a road trip across the US and that was pretty amazing. Though I guess the best two places on the road drove from Maryland to LA. This is before I actually moved out here, but I visited New Orleans and New Orleans was just this whole, even though it's part of the US, it's totally different than anywhere else. It's so unique. The culture there is so unique and the blend of like Caribbean and French and all these other influences into like the American South is so incredibly unreal.\n\nAre you capable of that?\nYeah.\nFilm. You know, that's actually a question I've been asking myself. My entire life I've had phases of interest. So when I was very young, I was really into keys and then tools. Like I'd go around collecting keys and then I go around collecting tools, like just every sort of tool. I had a toolbox. My parents have told me that I had a phase before that with balls. Then I was really into insects, collecting insects and reptiles and animals and then the dinosaur phase. At a certain point I got really into music, like first rap and then guitar and then acting. At some point in there, I remember telling someone that right now I'm interested in playwriting and poetry, but eventually I was going to be interested in film. I could kind of see the trajectory coming, but I don't remember what led me to that conclusion. I think I just always led a sheltered life as far as movies are concerned. My parents didn't let me see an R rated movie until I was in high school almost. I never saw an R rated movie. I was also very squeamish. I remember when I was fairly young, maybe like six, I saw Star Wars. The first scene of Darth Vader breaks the guy's neck. It's just a little scene at the very beginning and that freaked me out and I had to leave the room. So I'm not really sure how I got into film, but I've always been fascinated by how people interact and acting and movies in general.\nYes. To be a filmmaker, to be able to direct and put together and make movies. I guess direct, I don't use that word so much because I think of it more as like I want the opportunity to put together and make movies. I want involvement in all the processes, but the best parable for that would be a director.\nWell, it's a lot better when I'm not living with them.\nIt's funny you should ask. I've been thinking about it a lot lately. I think I'm closest with my dad. I get along with my brother and sister, but I don't. My brother's in a foreign country right now, so I don't have the opportunity to talk with him. But I spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else because I feel like he's the one who most accepts me and thinks positively about me. So I have a complicated relationship with my parents and my family in general.\nWell, on the Myers-Briggs personality test I'm an extrovert, but I'm not. I probably would consider myself extremely introverted. I see other extroverts and no matter who they're around they're able to strike up conversations. I'm a fairly shy person, inhibited person maybe. So I like to, but I'm working on it.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I can only just take screen saver.\n\nSo what do you do to relax?\nWell, in the past I would smoke weed, but I've quit smoking weed. So now I have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie. Or maybe go. If it's a worn-out sort of stress, then that's what I do. But if it's a more anxious type stress, I might go on an intense walk. Don't really exercise that much, but I like competitive sports and hiking.\nWell, I always like arguing. I wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper. I enjoy a vicious debate. As long as I won't revert to personal attacks in my arguments, I try to keep it on subject and try to explain myself as best I can, which can get frustrating because I'm not the best articulator of what I think. One of my weaker points I would say.\n\nWhat happened?\nI forget the question.\nLast time I had a heated debate was about the movie Boogie Nights. I didn't lose my temper exactly, but I get very passionate about it.\n\nWhy did they think it was the best movie?\nThey think that all of the stories within Boogie Nights, each of them could be their own separate stories. They just think that there's a complexity of character within the movie and that somehow it's like the end of an era, which makes it kind of like Casino and there's attention to detail of the different characters, how they interact in the plot. I think the heated debate became about that. Personally, it's not like a bad movie or anything, but I just don't think Dirk Diggler is that meaningful of a character. The way I came out of the movie is basically the same even though in watching it again, I was able to reevaluate it. There's nothing bad about the movie. There's good solid acting. The directing is good. The camera moves are cool. But for me it was meaningless. And then they were saying that a movie that I saw recently that I really did like was Django Unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme heated part of the conversation. In the movie Django Unchained, you have Django and Django is a two-dimensional character, but I don't think that necessarily takes away from what the big purpose of the movie is. And you have Dr. King Schultz who's this mentor character and the person I was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and because he was intelligent, there's no way he would have risked his life to save Django or would have gone into this second act where they go to this plantation to save Django's wife, etc. The reason for her giving that argument, either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't, is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themselves for someone else, which strikes me as like. Her basic argument was that altruism doesn't exist. It was a very Ayn Rand type argument. The only thing people do is serve themselves. All people are out to serve themselves. I'm not arguing that every decision has a mix of altruism and something. Even the most altruistic type decision, there's maybe kernels of self-interest in there, but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor. It led it to an extremely passionate debate. I don't think I necessarily lost my temper. I think of losing my temper as reverting to ad hominem attacks. I wasn't criticizing her worldview.\n\nYeah, I'm glad you understand.\nI don't know if I necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory. I would say an issue that I have is not being able to remember in as much detail as I would like. I remember feelings and moments, not stories. My life doesn't always sink together into a coherent story. It's like this moment and that moment.\nCould it just be one of the hardest decisions?\nI'm having a hard time recalling a moment where I had to choose between two options. There's no Sophie's Choice type moment in my life. But I do think that the decision to leave New York after having lived there for five years was very difficult. I had to do it for money reasons and because all my core group of friends were leaving and going other places in the world and the one other person I was close to was living with someone who I did not get along with at all. It was either gonna live with people who I wasn't as close with or Craigslist or move home. It was a tough decision to leave. In fact, it was so tough that I had to justify it by saying that I would be moving back to New York within a month or two, which didn't end up happening.\n\nHow hard was that?\nIt was hard. It was isolating. I had fallen in love with one of my closest friends and that had gone extremely badly. So I wasn't on speaking terms with her and everyone on my list of friends who was closer to her. It wasn't quite her or me, but that was the way that I saw it at the time. I was socially isolated.\nWell, recently it's been awful. I like to. Last night I slept for ten and a half hours, which seems to be the length of time that I have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams. But previous to that night, the night before last and the night before that I got four hours and two hours of sleep because I was working on set and I would get back and I just couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason. Too much riled up energy or something.\n\nTired?\nNot immediately. Initially upon waking up, I had really enjoyed being up in the early morning and I also stopped drinking caffeine. I've had a little bit of coffee the last two days, but before the last two days, I hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks. With caffeine in my system, I'm ready to go. Without caffeine, I'm quieter, more introverted.\n\nSince when?\nChanging my thoughts. I mean, I guess when having just moved here, there was a period of time at the beginning where the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people because I moved here because I have a group of friends here or a couple of friends. The push to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first. I think that I'm slowly coming into terms with that and moving past it, but the pressure is still there.\n\nNo.\nThe last time I felt really happy might have to reach back. I think the last time I felt really happy was during the writing process. Last year I shot a movie, co-wrote, co-directed, co-produced. That still consumes my life, but during the writing stages of that movie, we would bunk down, eat breakfast, work really hard, pure creative energy between me and the person writing it. I remember going to bed and I was so thrilled to be working on what I was working on and working with the person I was working with. I felt like it. That was more than a year ago though, but when you're making a movie, you can't allow yourself to be happy, especially if you're doing it by yourself.\n\nI would say that I'm very accepting of other people and always very empathic and open, excited about new ideas and open to new ideas.\nI guess I wish I was less ruled by fear, more fearless in my everyday interactions and in my zest for living.\n\nI think there are numerous instances in my childhood in which my parents were always on the other side of the court. Other parents were like if their kid was in trouble, their kid was perfect. There's something wrong with other people, but my parents were always the opposite. In particularly my mom, so I would say that there are a couple of instances in which I was blamed when what I was doing was.\n\nTen years ago.\nStay stay stay. I think that I have a tendency to get really caught up in an idea and devote myself entirely to it, but sometimes ideas are too easily. Do as much as possible. Don't decide that you are only going to do one thing. Learn to read music. I'd love to learn how to play the drums. I'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more acting classes. It's only now that I.\n\nGoodbye.",
         "Okay, here's my story regarding my experiences with depression:\n\nThings have been rough lately, especially with sleep. I've had nights with only two to four hours of sleep because I was working on set. Then I have trouble falling asleep. I felt a lot of pressure when I first moved to LA, trying to find a job and meet people. It was overwhelming, but I think I'm slowly getting used to it, though the pressure is still there.\n\nIt's hard to remember when I was last truly happy. I think it was during the writing process of a movie I co-wrote, co-directed, and co-produced last year. We had so much creative energy. But when you're making a movie, especially independently, it's hard to allow yourself to be happy. I wish I was less ruled by fear and more fearless in my everyday interactions and zest for living.",

So, how you doing today?\nI'm doing pretty good. Hanging out. Nice weather. I just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you, the digital you that I'm seeing. It's funny because I've just always thought that the conveying of emotions or feelings be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself.\nThank you.\nI'm from Born and raised in Los Angeles Venice area Marvista specifically. That's where I'm from.\nWell, there's a lot more that I don't like, but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up, that the idea of certain medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent topic, very thought upon, and I feel that Los Angeles' deep culture is why I stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand. The human mentality here is very hectic, very chaotic, a lot due to the vehicle, the car, the freeway, and this idea that we're on a grind. It's a very hectic human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing.\nUm From my travels, it's not like well, I do enjoy a lot of things about travel, but it's more like I enjoy not being trapped in the city with all these made up ties and restraints. I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this faux man-made image that it is here. So I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is.\nThanks. Would you Okay\nWell, I kind of recently last year went to Los Banos Central California area and although it wasn't that far from LA, it was completely different energy. There was no phones. There was no Wi-Fi. There's no TV there was sanity there was relative sanity in the sense that people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chill and I was working at a hot spring resort And I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry. You don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so I just wanted to get out of here and experience the real deal.\nWell Currently I'm studying Physical therapy. I'm about to become licensed massage therapist. But before that I was going to for music composition so I was just writing scores for films animations dance productions theater productions. Yeah, it was cool. It was fun trippy very trippy but I had to leave that because tuition hikes going up to like 50,000 a year for like a four-year BFA is not the deal not trying to trap myself with these chains of federal loans. So yeah\nDream job. Hmm My dream job would be anything that I can do to alleviate these metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they've been put in. My dream is to alleviate the nightmare. My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and with physical therapy and artistic expression, I've got some great ideas. Yeah\nI guess more outgoing. I just like experiencing things so outgoing. Yeah\nI do to relax is just kind of breathe it out chill. Maybe make a smoothie or some tea. I'm gonna go bike riding right\nWell, it wasn't arguing I don't really argue much I just like to save my opinion and have it be understood and I like the person I'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was I guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from New York and we were talking about writing and basically, we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written. Yeah, so yesterday\nThat's tough. I haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt. What about you? What's something you feel guilty about?\nI don't really wish I could erase anything from my memory because then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased, you know butterfly effect kind of like.\nMaybe the time she was going to school, I was taking the year off, and I was just kind of hanging around. But we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn't turn out. Nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it, but this one turned out a little different actually quite different than I thought it would be in I thought it was funny but yeah, it ended up me leaving before the lease ended and it actually ended up yeah with us separating but that's something I wish Maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully.\nHardest decision Hmm Maybe not a hard dissed but a hard decision I had to make was leaving school dropping my continuation of achieving a BFA. Yeah, that could have been the hardest\nI mean, of course money is a big issue tuition hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan to support that but that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around and but another reason why I decided to leave had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because Art Institute, you know, that's a it's a funny idea in itself already and basically I was a musician being taught by a musician to make music and same with you know, all the other dancers or the theater students, you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance, you know, and it's just it's just not quite as artistic as I thought art would be art Comes from somewhere somewhere sweet and deep and purple and not not from out there, you know, so yeah\nIf it's kind of easy I mean it depends, you know if I remember to make some chamomile tea or if I remember to breathe and go through my mantras or remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then I can get into it real nice But if I just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until I remember to breathe. Yeah\nUm, yeah, basically just what I said just breathing or you know If I'm hanging out with friends coming home late, and if I get the lucky chance to be medicated from you know a nice nice indica Then it really does, you know indica does put me down pretty nice Pretty drowsy. So a lot of things breathing, you know, you know medical herbs like chamomile cannabis and just leaving myself of bad bad juju\nI guess not if I can't think of something now I've been feeling kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a gray line But it's a nice gray. It's a really nice hue Some people wouldn't like this, but I really like that and it's stable Yes, it's comfortable. Yeah\nNo, I haven't Not by a certified medical professional no, but no I haven't\nYeah, I mean I just think like the whole You know, like you said PTSD depression and you know other you know mental instabilities. I think everybody is depressed. I think everybody is overjoyed. I think everybody's angry I think everybody's shy everybody's social all at the same time, you know, it's just Different days different variants different floats different boats, you know different waves different swells So yeah, I think I'm depressed. I think I'm really happy. I think I'm really angry. I think I'm really friendly, you know all that But just on different variants different floats\nReally happy\nI mean I feel really happy a lot and I feel really sad a lot but really happy was I guess maybe this morning when I was just biking over here just enjoying the Sun enjoying the breeze Biking yeah\nWell, I have a lot of best friends and they describe me all pretty differently but underlying that same idea maybe I'm just maybe in a nutshell just kind of Aquarius, I guess\nI Am 21 so 20 years ago, I would have told myself to keep being a baby Stay young and don't lose sight, you know, don't stop listening Keep letting things happen. Don't make them happen be be a beautiful baby. That's what I would have told myself. be a beautiful baby\nI guess recently what has been shown to me through me by me is my ability to work with others and I'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint, I've been a collaborating a lot with artists working on a lot of different mediums mixed media projects and I'm really comfortable with it and with other people's and melting our ideas together. Yeah\nThat's a weird question like trying to make me single out the one moment that I today reflect upon and think about like it's some past glory that I'm not capable fulfilling today So I think the proudest moment of my life is right now chilling Hanging with you Yeah\nYeah, thank you\nIt's interesting my immediate family is a Mother father younger sister older brother older brother is in South Asia Just kind of backpacking around Younger sis she's really chill. She kind of does music too, and we just hang out We're really cool. Mom mama. I'm really chill with lover to death She gets me and dad He doesn't get me but I Love the art that he makes he he does crazy painting and I kind of get him through that but uh yeah, there needs to be more communication which is being worked upon\nCool yeah, thanks for wondering about my thoughts Goodbye Goodbye\nSo I guess I push this guy oh So I can still talk to you",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, from my perspective:\n\nI haven't been officially diagnosed with depression, but I believe everyone experiences a range of emotions, including depression, happiness, anger, and shyness. It's just that the intensity and frequency vary from person to person. I definitely feel really happy a lot, like this morning when I was biking in the sun. But I also feel really sad a lot too. Lately, I've been cruising on a \"gray line,\" which is stable and comfortable for me. To cope with difficult feelings, I rely on breathing exercises, chamomile tea, and sometimes cannabis. I try to rid myself of bad energy. If I remember to breathe and follow my routines, I can manage my thoughts. If I get caught up in my thoughts, it takes longer to get back on track.",

I moved in there and he told me that he didn't have any marijuana or marijuana plants because he didn't want to be around. He had that so I had to move out because he had a self-in-living room. Yeah, it does. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and him would handle differently.\nI don't know. Good question. Probably... Probably, I don't know, probably with an ex-boyfriend. We broke up.\nOkay. Can you tell me about that?\nYeah, it's in the past. I'm over him. He was a jerk anyway.\nOkay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nHardest decision? Leaving home?\nTell me about that.\nWell, I could try a better life out here in California but I miss home.\nYeah, I'm sorry. Isn't it uncomfortable for you to talk about this?\nYep.\nOkay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nMy roommates don't have the TV on now. It's pretty good.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well?\nTired. I'm lazier during the day.\nUh-huh.

It's been a while. It's been like, god, more over two years.\nCan you tell me about that?\nUm, I didn't have any money problems. I was doing fine. Um, yep. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed?\nOh, what did I do? Um, I was with my cats at home here in California and they're playing outside.\nTell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nMy ideal weekend would be nice.

Um, I persevere.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nYeah, I'd rather not. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nUh, me a few years ago.

Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye! Bye! Press the button?\nYes.\nOkay.",
         "I've been feeling down lately, mostly because I'm struggling financially and don't have a boyfriend. It's been over two years since I felt truly happy, back when I didn't have money problems. Lately, I've just been feeling more sad than usual. While I haven't been diagnosed with depression, it's been hard. I get frustrated because I'm poor and don't want to be. Leaving home to try for a better life in California was a hard decision, and while I miss home, I try to persevere. I find some comfort in small things, like watching my cats play and sometimes turning on a fish tank screensaver when I feel tense.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just here to talk to people in safe and secure environments. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything, your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes.\nSo, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. That's good. Where are you from originally? Uh, California. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather, I like the people. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. That's primarily it. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Sociology. Really? Yep. How did you decide to do that? It's a topic that just really interested me, the most out of all the other subjects. Are you still working on that? No. What's your dream job? To be a writer. Can you tell me about that? I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in. Like what? Like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. What do you think of today's kids? I think they have it pretty easy. They don't know how easy they have it. Do you travel a lot? No, not really. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing. What do you do to relax? I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing. Or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing like watch TV. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long. Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. Why? Because they basically sort of raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much. I understand. Tell me about a situation that you wish you could erase from your memory. Uh... I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yeah. Yes. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Um... I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Uh... because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision, I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh... my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh... not really super easy. I sort of... I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Uh... normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh... last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends right now? Uh... probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Uh... I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh... no. I don't think. I think regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um... Don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um... Sometimes I can be kind of lazy. I'd like to have more of a sort of better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh... just sort of putting off stuff until you know right when it's due or after it's due things like that. procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh... sometimes for the things that I write, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um... I guess I'm most proud of the fact that I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um... just hanging out with my friends. people watching. Watching a movie that's good. listening to music. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.",

         "Okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? California, here in Los Angeles. Really? Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? I love being near the beach. I love living in a big city. And I love the fact that I have lots of friends and family here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Just so many, sometimes too many people. But apart from that, I'm generally happy here. Okay. What did you study at school? Photography and language studies. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I love photography. I was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well. So I wanted to continue to learn more about it. And with languages, I come from a mixed background. So I wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic background. How hard is that? It wasn't hard. It was a passion. So I enjoyed it. Are you still working on that? I'm not, no. What's your dream job? To do photography full-time, and also to do some of the things that I'm passionate about more creatively. Like what? I have an idea. I'd like to make a robe line. Women's robes and things like that. Awesome. Mm-hmm. Do you travel a lot? I have. I've traveled quite a bit, and I love travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different cultures, different countries, meeting new people, all of that. And the language. What are some of your trips? I lived in Greece for over a year. I taught English there and moved around to different parts of Greece and really had a great time. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think just having my group of friends that I met there and going through the experience with them. I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to Elefonissos in a car with everybody and having just a fantastic time. That sounds like a great situation. Yes, it was. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm shy to begin with, and as I get to know people, then I'm much more outgoing. What do you do to relax? I just stay at home. Maybe watch a movie. Rest in bed. Watching a movie in bed. That's probably one of the things I like to do to relax. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I think very good. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? It was probably with my boyfriend regarding money issues. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now. Can you tell me about that? I'm having some struggles in my career right now. Financially, it's becoming very difficult. I'm sorry. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it has been difficult, but I've been working very hard to remedy that. That's great. Can you give me an example of that? While I'm here, I'm doing this focus study. I'm doing many things to generate more money, working harder, but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my career. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Probably being raped. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Sometimes. Are they triggered by something? Not that I'm aware of. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling stressed and worried. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't seem to have any problem with it. I seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm grumpy and lethargic in the morning. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was probably deciding to not have a child. Can you tell me about that? I was pregnant and wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy. That was also due to financial burden. The father I was involved with did not want the child. I made that very difficult decision. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Really, really happy. I know. When I went to Cancun on a holiday over the New Year period. How did you feel in that moment? I felt absolutely fantastic. I felt happy. I felt relaxed. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world temporarily. Free. That's great. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive. Definitely more assertive. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I would say I'm a wonderful friend. When I love somebody, I love them very deeply. Friends, family, boyfriend. I think that's good. I'm very loyal as a friend. I'm honest. I care about people. I'm fun to be with. I think those are some of my best qualities. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, with my father, is not so great. My parents were divorced when I was young. He's sort of been in and out of my life forever. Mostly out. It's not fantastic, but it's something that I'm used to. It's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then I lost him. It's still not the best situation. I still wish that could be remedied somehow. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. I love her so much. She's been there for me since I was very, very young. She's always been just incredible. I love her so much. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so I don't have to work so hard now. Okay. Is there anything you regret? I regret exactly that. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy. That was probably one of the best times in the last few weeks. Tell me about your kids. They're great kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren. There are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. We're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot. It's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them or overpunish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child. It's really difficult so I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to travel the world and live in many, many other places around the country and around the world. The fact that I've learned several languages and the fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends. Okay. I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye.",

Um, I actually can't remember the last time I argued with someone.\nAll the people I've hurt in the past Well, I Like cheated on people Hurt their feelings intentionally Done things I shouldn't have done that I regret now.\nWell with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now I probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out.\nHardest decision I've ever had to make was Man I really don't know actually.\nTell me about your experience or the symptoms you've been most likely to experience.\nTell me about that.\nJust seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible.\nMe and my family aren't very close. We don't I mean they've always been there for me and I appreciate it But we've never had that close connection Especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it's pretty different when it comes to those racial I mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of step each other each other's feet on But aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other. It does get kind of awkward, but it's okay.\nI Think they are out of control. I think that they're They're Learning things that they shouldn't know at this age I think that they're doing things they shouldn't be doing and I don't feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn't be doing it I feel like they're being applauded by the media. They're being applauded by celebrities that they follow And there's not enough being done about it, and they're just getting lost.\nUm depends on the night some nights. It's pretty hard some nights. I fall asleep like a baby. Usually creative actually when I can't sleep. I'll just stay up, and I'll write something or I read a book and ideas will pop up.\nLately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I'm energized and I'm alive And then some not some days when I'm just you know just sitting there Just mellow thinking Not like my live self I don't know. It's just always been like that always have those ups and those downs, but they kind of balance each other out.\nNo.\nNo.\nThe last time I felt really happy was Hmm today Just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day I Went to see you some friends.

I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be.\nUm this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and She pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time how I've hurt people how I've hurt her The ways I've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all.\nMy parents I Mean although we don't see eye to eye that always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day Although I never listen to them or I don't choose to listen to them Once it happens I learned from it and I'm like, oh, that's what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learned to Understand that they are wiser than me and that they do know more than me.\nI'm not so much anymore. I travel around LA try to find new sites to see but as far as I don't travel outside I'm discovering new things discovering things you never knew were there or the limitless possibilities I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures New things that go against what's normal for us and for myself.\nA Few days ago, I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert I had to offer and it was just enjoyable I felt free away from all this These cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time felt good.\nI'm most proud that I've always been different That despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird or I'm odd or I think weird things I've always maintained my original mentality.\nYou",

         "Okay. But, I think now you can have a seat. Thank you. Alright. Now I'm going to put the doorbell over here. When she's done, she'll let you know to press that button. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just creating this talk to people instead of interviewing them. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions as a starter. Your answers are fully appreciated. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing really good. That's good. Where are you from or is your home? I'm from Granada Hills, California. It's the San Fernando Valley, part of Los Angeles. Cool. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. I like the diversity in people. I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one race or kind of food. I love the beaches. All the activities you could go do. Theme parks, aquariums, stuff like that. Museums. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The smog. There's a lot of creepy guys. Do you travel a lot? I've pretty much traveled around LA. I've been cross-country back three times. Twice was when I was 17. Wow. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live. I'd love to know the only place. When I was 17, I ran away with my boyfriend to upstate New York to Watertown. It was like a Navy Army kind of town. We had an apartment there. It snowed a lot. We sold antiques for a living. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Getting passes, press passes for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through a friend. Getting to meet rock stars and hang out at the private parties. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm very outgoing. I love people. What do you do to relax? I go to the gym and work out quite a bit. It helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going. I notice if I don't work out a couple days, I feel a little more tired than normal. It just helps me feel good. How are you at Conflict? I'm pretty good at it. I'm very calm. I've worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm. They're the customers, so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid because of the money they're spending. I'm good at resolving consumer conflicts and stuff on the job. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people. I started getting loud just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean. I wonder if you're talking to people like that, they might not like it and they could attack you or something. You never know. It is LA. That sucks. What's something you feel guilty about? I really don't feel guilty about anything, decisions I've made in my life. I think I've made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass, what I'm doing. I grew up in church, so I haven't gone in years, but I still have those values and the rules, the 10 Commandments and stuff in my head. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called the proper authorities and followed through on a court case instead of letting him bully me out because it wasn't up to code. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from. After a few months, he was coming to LA and going back home. I decided to move there and I had just started this business I was doing, event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there on the East Coast and it didn't work out. It was tough deciding, should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experience something new or stay in what I was doing. What did you study at school? I had a degree in dental assisting, I did that for a year, I didn't like it. Then I was studying communications, radio and television broadcasting and journalism. Are you still working on it? I'm doing event work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to get a website going and have where I'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of writing for someone else. How did you decide to do that? I always wanted to write and was always into the news and music and art growing up. I really liked Connie Chung, she was like a channel 4 newscaster in the 80s and I loved Barbara Walters. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My sister, she doesn't talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom. I never really knew my dad, it doesn't bother me. I have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them on phone, we just communicate on Facebook or Twitter. How easy is it for you to go to sleep? Oh, I go right to sleep. When I get tired I just go to sleep. How is it for you? Pretty good, energetic, I've been motivated to go look for more event work, event planning stuff and really grinding it more than I was. How hard is that? I mean it's kind of hard because you've got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I mean I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone I know dies. I wouldn't say that I'm just super like, oh my god, happy all the time but it's like an even keel that I feel pretty good all the time. What would you say are some of your best friends? I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them at ease and I could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene or situation or a group of people that I'm used to, I could still jump in, talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I want to make more money. Me too. Tell me about a time when someone knew you were really bad and knew about yourself. I remember in like second grade, people used to make fun of me because I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's, one of the highest grades in the class, so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or stuff like that. How would your best friend describe you? Very talkative. She would just say that I talk to everyone. And that I'm very friendly and if you need help, that I'll help someone, you know. Tell me about something you've been doing recently that you really enjoy. Recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like took him to the park and played and it was really nice and it was cool visiting her. I hadn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again. I like the area. What's something you feel close to about? I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more, like for my business instead of working for other people. I think I pursue it, but I think maybe I could put a little more time and day into it. I see. Tell me about maybe that or something maybe where you feel like it's coming from. I don't really know anything like that I want to erase or not happen. Okay. Is that what you mean by that? No, I feel good about my choices I've made and I think I'm on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do, the balls rolling and I'm getting things done. I'm not as big as I want to be, but I feel like I'm on my way there. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Like 10 years ago I would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as I was. My friend we call Mojo. Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball I'm rolling. He's one of the biggest people in my life telling me you're talented, you could do it. He's just a really good motivation for me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm going to get to that point. Great, thanks.",

         "You're saying right this is So let's just want to say one thing real quick here too late I Just want to say okay. I miss my recall isn't that good I don't know what the time I did with her last time because when I went back there I think they asked me questions like recall questions from this so I should try to be aware of like How I'm answering of which things about her Okay, all right, oh I see okay, I got you okay Well what she said no, okay, okay, I got you then all right. Thank you\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. My answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? Doing okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from LA. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. I like the sports teams. I like the entertainment. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's pretty much the same year-round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad. You don't get to get all four seasons, so it's kind of like a mixed bag. I guess maybe I'm kind of used to it by now, so it would be nice to explore other areas. I've lived here all my life, haven't done too much traveling, so it's a little bit of a ruddiness to it. But overall it's okay. Okay. What did you study at school? I took computer programming and operations, but that's going back to the 70s. What made you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? No, I kind of phased out. I still use computers, but I haven't been in programming for a long time. Why? Well, I kind of got into another area, kind of a diversion to another area in my life. This is going back to the late 70s. I kind of took another turn, and by the time I got back into it, I kind of got into another field. So I never really pursued it to the degree that I wanted to. What's your dream job? Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? What do you need to do to relax? I watch music. I watch TV. What do I do to relax? I just try to avoid stressful situations, so I kind of stay relaxed. I also talk to my friends, too. I'll be around an area, kind of a comfort area, where I feel safe. I can just dialogue with people. I'm not really worried about my own problems. I'm just focused on being in the moment with my friends and acquaintances. How are you at consoling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really have a temper problem. It takes a lot to get me to explode. In my younger days, I think I had a slight bit of temper. I never had a really bad temper, but temper is not really an issue I have. I tend to be pretty mellow, easy-going. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Wow, that's a good question. I'm not sure, to be honest. I didn't think about that for a long time. To be honest, I can't come up with an answer on that. It's not really part of my repertoire. Nothing comes to mind off the top of my head. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I don't really have too much family left. The only one I have is just me and my uncle. We communicate on a regular basis. He lives in Clearwater, Florida. We're okay. He's in his 80s, and I'm in my 50s. We have small talk. He's concerned about my well-being, but it's on a shallow level. We don't get really deep. He's got his own problems, so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation. Other than him, there's not really anybody else I have. It probably makes me a little bit depressed because I don't really feel I have anybody I can really count on or really confide in. How have you been feeling lately? Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Have you been diagnosed with depression? Why? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Let me think about that a minute. Actually, it wasn't that long ago. I helped out a lady at a trade show. It was at Anaheim Natural Products Expo. It was pretty nice. We had some nice meals afterwards. There were a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples. It was in Anaheim, so I got a chance to get away from LA. I met some interesting people. They were very outgoing. They were willing to have me experience their product or service. I was around people that I worked with who I got to socialize with. I think I was pretty happy back then. That was about a month ago. That sounds like a great situation. How would your best friend describe you? What would you say of some of your best colleagues? Is there anything you regret? What comes to your mind? What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I was going with other people's opinion, other people's advice. I was going away from my basic beingness, the way I really felt. For example, I would do aggressive investing, which if it turned out good, I would have been well off for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, it went the opposite way. I regretted going with my gut feeling and letting other people influence me. By nature, I'm a conservative person, so I should do more conservative investments. In other areas of my life, I tend to be more conservative, but I made some aggressive financial decisions. That always goes back to that area as far as what I regret. Tell me how you spend your weekend. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. I'll see you next time. Did you do one with her before you did this? You can take your headset off now. You can go back there. You're going to finish up with a quick survey about your experience. You're going to start by pressing this button. You're going to keep going until you hit the next big stop sign, and then you're going to press this button to let us know you're done. We really value feedback so you can take care of your answers.",

         "Okay, no, I was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual person. Yeah, like a virtual reality thing. Okay. So how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York. Really? When did you move to LA? Oh, I moved to LA in the 70s, but I lived a lot of different places. Um, I guess every few years, but I travel a lot, so I've lived in Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Hong Kong, too. Different cultures, food, music, rituals, everything, the smells, the colors, makes you feel alive. Excuse me, one of my trips, oh, I lived in Kenya for about a year, I'd say. I love horseback riding, so when you're viewing other animals, when you're kind of disguised in the scent of a horse, you can approach the animals a lot closer. So it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along, you know, seeing so many animals. Yeah, in Kenya. Um, probably when I went to a Messiah village, and I happened to, I used to live in Hawaii and I had been to Tahiti and I was wearing one of those perraus that are hand painted and I had it tied over the left shoulder with a twisted or not. And I happened to enter a Messiah village for the first time that day and I looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed Messiah? And then they came back and gave me what appeared to be uh some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have like weighed my ears straight down and um and then then it gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper Messiah. So, but I you know, I just I have a lot of uh I think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world I just uh you feel like you're alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken. Yeah. I think it's not so clear cut. I think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both. I mean, I think I can be extremely shy sometimes, but extremely brazen uh and very courageous at other times. Probably one of my best virtues is I'm very gutsy person. So when I really feel passionate about something, I risk everything to go achieve it sometimes. Um, I believe that um usually well I make decisions very quickly and I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how I could make decisions quicker and I told him I said well in each case you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and I said not really because it's gut wise there's only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98 chance of failure even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so I always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice because who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yields no joy. What do you do to relax? Pardon? You said you put your fish in when you're annoyed. What do I do when I'm annoyed? I think when I'm annoyed sometimes like it's because sometimes I can have I need to be a little more patient I guess you really have to put yourself in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy. How hard is that? Not really. I think that's the reason why I enjoy traveling so much because you're put in other situations where you're forced to to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from yours different situations I've been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is. When was the last time you argued with someone and won? Let me think. Last time I argued about something I'm trying to remember. Oh, I think it's when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something. Can you tell me about that? Oh I know what it was it was somebody who belonged to the Scientology faith. I inherited possibly an immune disorder from my mother. My mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I have like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photosensitive and I had an episode where I had big flare up and I wasn't really feeling well and I was I was very flushing and everything and the Scientologist tells me that I needed to be audited and he said something about are you aware of past lives and I had told him that I was Buddhist and I was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed to be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware that about something in your past and I go yes I believe that many religions including Buddhism and Scientology believe that things that you have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you feel better make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe I said that you know that you have the power of each person has a godlike or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when I'm on the verge of possibly being I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years I don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it is I think when I think I'm on the verge I take sort of like and I did this even when I was a child when I was seven I would fall down I have my boo boo and I would take I would say I would have the good part you know help the bad part from a simplistic way in terms of a child and I would actually even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I concentrated healing and when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that you did her last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but I was just I think annoyed and irritated only because the Scientologist told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even a matter I said of whether he was whether he took 20 40 courses or whether I've been practicing Buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years or whether somebody been practicing some type of Christianity for 50 years and been sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so I just was thinking that is the antithesis of somebody who says they were enlightened but it's just the way I guess he kept going cramming his you know his faith down my throat that after a while I was pretty patient with it but then it was so pompous that I became irritated especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet this same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn't point it out to him because I just didn't even want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip because you need to be audited that something that you did in your past that you didn't want to do. So he had this idea of this person getting audited completely and I found my thought he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but, you know, I just didn't, you know, care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it. But other than that, I mean, I don't. Sometimes to have a little more tact, I guess, when in terms of patience. I can think of that right away. I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital. How did you decide to do that? My brother was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he is in the medical field. So my sister and I said, well, you know, he's the medical one. So he's probably used to seeing this all the time. But it turns out he was the weakest one. And even after, you know, my father kept, you know, bucking these, body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things. You see all this jerking of body movements and stuff. It was just very hard. But, you know, as after a while, the, you know, even the physicians and even the pastor from that particular, you know, hospital, they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that, his brain function would have been, you know, negligible. Yeah. That sounds very hard. Yeah, it was. Tell me about that or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Hmm. I don't think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I've had to block them, I really don't know what it is within my makeup, which doesn't make me feel like I need to. I don't keep I have friends that have unmitigated issues, which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear. And for some reason, I feel blessed that I don't really I can't really even think of something that I mean, I've had some bad situations happen to me, but it's not that for some reason they've traumatized me and affecting, you know, my behavior, where I would where I block it, that I'm not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason. So I really can't think of anything. I mean, there's bad things that happen and I know that there, but it's not like I feel like it's necessary for me to block them because I've been able to, you know. Except sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened. OK. How easy is it for you to make a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I can usually make myself sleep in any situation. If I have a one hour flight to San Francisco, I could just kind of lean against the window with a pillow, have the blanket over and even an hour flight pass out before the plane is even taken off from the ground. So I can I have literally when I've had little sleep and I very high energy. So I don't really need that much sleep. But say, like if I'm in Africa in a. Bumpy potholes, unpaved road, and I suddenly decide I need a few moments of sleep, I will just prop something up, put my elbow against the window and say, I think I'm going to take a nap for 15 minutes ago like this and through the jostling, I could just take a nap for 15 minutes. So I don't really have that problem. OK, pretty OK. I mean, I could deal without the skin flare ups, but, you know, from the photosensitivity and all that. But other than that, I'm pretty good spirits. Have I ever studied what? I've never studied using a behavior. I still couldn't hear you, I'm sorry. I've never studied changes in my behavior. What was the word? Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Uh-uh. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, I don't know, just with friends and everything, just even this past week, just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having a great meal, laughing, just, you know, having a good time, listening to music. Regret about my entire life, you mean, or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about? You know, it's funny, I find that a lot of the negative experiences that have happened in my life have also been opened up experiences that are also great that I have not overlooked. For example, I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my whole savings that I've had to start all over again. And sometimes people say to me, like, are you sure you're OK? Are you just pretending to be OK? Or are you angry? Do you want to seek revenge? If I was, you know, because my business partner essentially ripped me off. We knew each other's families, which was even more difficult in a way. And he stole essentially my whole life savings, essentially, in a way. And he got sent to prison. The FBI was involved. Interpol was involved. I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth. And. But, you know, if I hadn't get involved, I hadn't gotten involved with him in business, I wouldn't have had a lot of rich experiences. And I think sometimes the reason why. I don't know why I'm such a positive person, but for some reason I'm able to. It's not that I'm purposely trying to. I do see the positiveness in even a horrible situations. I wouldn't have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich. I wouldn't have learned to speak as good Spanish. German lived in in Europe if I had not got involved in business with my business partner, who ended up ripping me off. But and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that I developed during that period of time. And in a way, it was a total different life, a different world that that would, you know, that I would have never had the chance to live through if I had not been involved in my. But of course, it cost me financially. And but then again, I've always been a type of person who, you know, money is in everything. And I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it. So there you go. And for example, what are my favorite? Times in my life, probably when I lived in Kenya, and you would think that, you know, a lot of people have this really bad vision that I may be looking living in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively. I mean, it's not like that at all. But and you'd think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that, I mean, actually, and I really didn't have, you know, that much mean many material goods at the time. I mean, I had the blast. I had probably the one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya. The same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16. To live your life with passion. And again, like choose the way I was saying earlier about making decisions. You have to make those decisions gut wise. What will give you a sense of awe and wonderment? What will make you give you joy? And you have to it's regardless of what the percentages are, even if you only have a one percent chance of success, you have to go to that because that's the only thing that will yield, you know, the happiness in your life. Mm hmm. The fact that I've adhered to that and been brazen, whatever you want to say, have the balls, the chutzpah, the kahanist to go ahead and follow my passions. And, you know, I guess people call them sometimes strong decisions, usually decisions that are when you where you remain unscathed, usually don't yield joy. That's just Murphy's law. That's just the way it is. OK, I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Bye. Bye. Hi. Hi.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and we love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes. I'm doing okay.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nI'm from Greenwich, Connecticut.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhen did you move to LA?\nI moved here in 2008, so about five years ago.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI try to go back at least once a year. Sometimes I go more, sometimes less.\nHow does it compare to LA?\nOverall, I think I like where I'm from better than LA in general.\nWhy?\nI think that other than it being somewhere I'm familiar with, the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I'm used to and less superficial.\nI understand. Why did you move to LA?\nI moved out here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California.\nHow easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?\nInitially, it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience, so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once. But then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here, it became more difficult than originally.\nWhat's your study at school?\nFine Arts and Photography.\nThat sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?\nI was interested in photography since high school. I did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments. So I decided to pursue art.\nAre you still working on that?\nYes, I have a fine arts degree that I got last year.\nAwesome. Are you happy to do that?\nYeah, I really enjoy working or interning in forensics. I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography. I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nThat's an interesting question. I guess just my childhood in general, growing up.\nCan you tell me about that?\nWell, my family is very close, my extended family as well, and most of them live within the area or on the east coast in general. So we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that.\nThat sounds like a great situation.\nYeah, it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible, which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nI consider myself more shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI watch reality television. I think it's kind of funny and lighthearted.\nLike what?\nI watch like Bravo TV, like the Real Housewives shows, and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to.\nOkay. How are you at controlling your temper?\nI'm good, I guess. I don't really have like a temper. If I'm more stressed out, it definitely shows in my attitude, but I don't really have like anger.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nWhen me and my boyfriend bicker all the time just like about like insignificant things. But other than that, I had an argument with my dad a few days ago.\nCan you tell me about that?\nThere's been like some tension going on since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter, things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her, although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. So for like the 30th time, we were on the phone and he was telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I had told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend because of the Jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very immature and telling me, oh, forget it, she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like I could care less because I don't care about having a relationship with her. So she doesn't want to hear from me, you know, it's easier for me.\nYeah, that sucks. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nI mean, it's been the same recurring argument a lot and I wish that I could, sometimes I do, but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue. But the thing is, is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me. So I kind of just like lose it and I can't really like not say anything.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nWell, I guess the hardest decision I made, which I didn't only realize that it's the hardest decision, like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college, because for me, I basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. So it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time. It felt like just like a progression of the next step. But looking back now, that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made.\nOK. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nWell, I wish I could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral, which obviously it wouldn't change anything. But it wasn't seeing her there was not something I'd want to like have in my memory.\nThere's someone that's been a positive influence on you.\nShe was. She was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental. And now, I mean, my parents are great role models just in general. I mean, they're very successful people. So whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people, they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nUsually it's easy. The problem is staying asleep no matter how late I go to bed, whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m. I will be up like clockwork by 730 or 8 o'clock in the morning, the latest every single day. And I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer.\nAre you triggered by something?\nNo, I just in the morning, I guess I'm a lighter sleeper, but I just wake up like I just cannot stay asleep anymore, which never used to be a problem this consistent. But now it's I cannot remember the last time I slept past 830 in the morning.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well?\nI mean, it just makes if I have to do stuff during the day, it makes it a lot more tiring. But it doesn't really. I'm so used to it now. It doesn't really change my mood. It's just part of every day.\nOK. How have you been feeling lately?\nUm, I don't know. I kind of just feel very like so so just no extreme highs, no extreme lows. It's kind of one note land. I mean, nothing like lately. Um, like recently, it's just I would say over a period of years, I've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing.\nNo, I have been diagnosed with anxiety. I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital because I thought it was more serious because I couldn't breathe. But they said that it was a little bit more serious. So I had to go to the hospital. I think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it, if they're open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing. Then, yeah, no, I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid. I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me. But it was never so I mean, we just sat around and talked about my day. It wasn't I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time. So I didn't really get much out of it.\nWell, I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday. When I'm there, I can always just we save up our money. So it's a complete vacation. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. I just every morning we wake up, we just go to the doctor. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. So we wake up, we hang out, just enjoy the day.\nThat's great. Is there anything you regret?\nIn general?\nYeah. I regret the college I chose to go to. I didn't be from the East Coast. The whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently. The universities out there are not the same as the tight-knit California school system out here. So when I was researching colleges, I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general college, just like Boston College back home or any other school with the name college at the end of it. I didn't realize until the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school. I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went. So it kind of created more problems for me.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nWell, considering I'm 22, I'd probably say 10 years ago, I would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California.\nHow would your best friend describe you?\nMy best friend would describe me as a great, charismatic, funny, outgoing, socially enjoyable person, which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me, which I mean, I don't, I mean, it is what it is. I am very outgoing and have a great time when I'm with my friends in my element. But around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things, I just, I am very shy and don't really speak much.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nRecently, my friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago, and I really enjoyed that.\nNice. Yeah. What would you say are some of your best qualities?\nUm, I'm very caring. I am a very good judge of character, which I mean, I guess, I mean, I consider it to be a quality for myself. I'm very, I mean, not very affectionate. I'm more, I mean, I guess, I guess so.\nOkay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.\nThanks. I can chat with you a little bit more about.",
         "Okay, here is a summary of the interviewee's experiences with depression, written from the first-person perspective:\n\nLately, I've been feeling very \"so-so\" – no extreme highs or lows, just kind of one-note. Over the past few years, I’ve become more secluded and reserved. I was diagnosed with anxiety after experiencing some breathing problems and going to the hospital. While I believe therapy can be helpful in the right setting, my childhood experiences with it weren't beneficial. One of the happiest times I can remember recently was when I was at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday because I didn't have to worry about responsibilities. I also have trouble sleeping, waking up early no matter when I go to bed, but I'm used to it now and it doesn't really change my mood. ",

         "Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? So, how are you doing today?\nThat's good.\nWhere are you from originally?\nReally?\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nDo you travel a lot?\nI do. I go to school in Chicago. And I've been to New York a couple times. San Francisco. And I took a road trip across the country. That was cool. I saw a couple states.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nSeeing new places. Going to landmarks that I've only read about or seen pictures of.\nI'd love to hear about one of your trips.\nI traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66. And the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen, probably.\nAwesome. How did you feel in that moment?\nHappy. And then just happy. It was beautiful. It was nice. I haven't felt like that in a long time.\nWhat's your dream job?\nI love making movies. But part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera. So a comedian, a comedic actor would be totally great. But that's hard.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nI am super outgoing. And I love talking to people a lot. I like being the center of attention. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI like to watch mindless television. Like Toddlers and Tiaras and Duck Dynasty. I like to watch TV programs where I don't have to pay attention at all.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nI'm okay at it. I get really emotional really fast. But I'm usually able to keep my anger down and not lash out at others and stuff, for the most part.\nHas that gotten you in trouble?\nSometimes I get into arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily. And I hate apologizing to people, so the fights could last pretty long.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nMy best friend Ryan, I think. And it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and how we were going to go back to the way it was before.\nHow hard is that?\nReally hard. He's my best friend and I miss him. But we messed up and it's just not the same. It's like not the same friendship.\nI'm sorry.\nMe too.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nToo many. I guess... When I have a boyfriend and he's a girlfriend, which was not okay, I wish I would have just realized that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks, which led to my breakup and then our friendship being really messed up.\nCould you have done anything to avoid it?\nI guess not spend as much time with him as I did. Being more assertive.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nI guess... It was in November. I was very depressed and suicidal. So I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER. And from the ER I had the choice to, I don't know, I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital. And even though I felt like I didn't have a choice, I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital, which was like the worst experience of my life ever.\nCan you tell me about that?\nUm, it was awful. It was in Chicago and it was scary. I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices. There were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old. And it was scary. I didn't know anyone, everyone. Most of the people there weren't depressed, they were violent. So that was pretty scary and I just, it was really hard for me.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nI had been so depressed for like a month. I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work. I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turning in any work and I wasn't talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and I was just in a really bad place. And when I finally was going to kill myself, I realized I needed help. It was. I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time. So I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again. I just want to get better. So I had to do it. I had to get help.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful?\nI feel like if you have the right therapist, it's really useful. I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far, but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles. So I have to make do with this new therapist. She's okay. We're not that great together, but she's who I have right now. It's better than nothing.\nWhy?\nEver since I got out of the hospital and I began medication for my depression, I just haven't been able to sleep well. Falling asleep is hard. Staying asleep is hard. Have really crazy, vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing. I guess just sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about or happening in my life, but they're just they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom, like, did we go here? Did we do this? Did this really happen? And it's usually, no, you dream that. Sometimes I've gotten so scared. I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up. Probably like two nights ago.\nTell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nI guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends. Maybe going home with them and bake some cookies, eat all the cookies, watch some TV, have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies. We watch a lot of movies.\nI would like to do my free time.\nGo for a walk. I don't know. Go to the beach.\nIt was nice to meet you. Bye.",
         "Okay, so I've struggled with depression, especially recently. Last November, I was in a really bad place – skipping classes, failing school, isolating myself from friends, and drinking heavily. I was even suicidal. It got to the point where I knew I needed help and told a friend I needed to go to the ER. I chose to go to a mental hospital in Chicago, which was honestly the worst experience of my life. It was scary and isolating. I started medication after I got out, but now I have trouble sleeping and have really disturbing dreams. I had severe depression as a younger teenager and tried to kill myself then and got put in therapy for quite some time. I do think therapy can be helpful if you find the right therapist. I had one I really connected with, but she's back in Chicago. My current therapist is okay, but it's better than nothing.",

         "Okay. Yeah. Gotcha. Cool. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious about the people in the space and the way they're doing. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I love hearing about you. I'll ask you to get to the space first. And please feel free to come in and have a look at the answers to our questions and comments. Can you agree with this? Sure.\nSo, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. How are you?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? Chicago.\nReally? Yeah. When did you move to LA? About 25 years ago.\nOkay. Yeah, it's been a while. How often do you go back there? Actually, I haven't been back. I like LA.\nHow does it compare to LA? It's a big city, so it's kind of similar, but the weather is not the same. So, gotta love LA for the weather.\nI didn't know that. Why did you move to LA? Family. I was a child.\nHow was music for you that you used to live in LA? It took a little adjustment, but not hard.\nThat's good. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather... I can't think of anything right off the bat, but I sure wouldn't want to leave. My family is here, so that's another reason why I wouldn't want to leave.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really, but I've traveled a little bit, yeah.\nWhat are you enjoying about traveling? Seeing new places, different people, the way they live their lives. Cool. I'd love to hear about your friends. I went to Monterey, California, in the middle of last year. That was very nice.\nWhat's one thing you're most familiar with? That's a good question. I'm not really sure. I can't think of anything right off the bat, which makes me think it's kind of weird.\nWhat did you study at school? Astronomy.\nWas that a good student? How did you decide to do that? I don't know. I just kind of fell into it. I took a course, liked it, and then took some more, and kind of just went down that path.\nAre you still working on that? No.\nWhy? There's not much job opportunities, so it's kind of limited.\nDoes it help? Yeah, it does.\nWhat's your dream job? My dream job? I would like to own a restaurant, a nice bar restaurant.\nCan you tell me about that? I'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to. At least in the area that I live in, most places don't seem very, kind of just seem like a dive bar, or just kind of worn out, run down. Something nice, something different, something creative, something vibrant, something that attracts a crowd. But it's probably costly, so I don't know if it's really plausible.\nDo you consider yourself a shy or outgoing? I'm definitely more shy, but I can be outgoing when I'm comfortable with people, but initially I'm pretty shy.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fist and scream safer. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Good idea. What do you do to relax? A lot of times I try to just lay back and do some deep breathing, just kind of clear your mind. Or maybe just watch a movie. Listening to music is good. Reading a book kind of just takes your mind away. Relax.\nHow are you at completing things? I've gotten much better at it. I used to have problems with that when I was younger, but I'm good with that now. I've learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations. You should think before you speak, that type of thing.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? My ex-girlfriend, when we broke up about three months ago.\nCan you tell me about that? How did you feel when you broke up? How do you feel about a situation that makes you a different person?\nOkay, I think I've asked everything you need. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Have a good day. Goodbye. Hey, that was weird. I felt like I was in therapy. Should I take this off? Okay.",

         "Okay. And then so I'm going to give you the doorbell right here. OK. When she's done, you press that button. All right, thank you. Hi. I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I love learning about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to come in if you don't mind. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you OK with this? Yes.\nSo how are you doing today? I'm OK.\nWhere are you from originally? I was born in Mississippi.\nReally? Yes.\nWhen did you move to LA? When I was 2 and 1 half years old. But actually it wasn't in LA, it was Santa Monica.\nYou were very young working there. Yes.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown? Never.\nWhy? I was only 2 and 1 half years old. I don't remember anything.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? Oh, I like the beach. I love all the restaurants. The music scene. Just a general excitement. Oh, and the parks and all that.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic. The maintenance on the streets. All the potholes. The pollution.\nWhat did you study at school? Well, I studied a number of things at school. At one point I had majored in public relations, journalism, specialization in journalism. Then I also studied... I was a pre-law major. I studied the law. Then I also studied human services courses.\nThat sounds interesting. What made you decide to do that? Mainly because I'm a people person and I enjoy helping people.\nWhat's your dream job? I don't really have one right now.\nDo you travel a lot? No, I don't.\nWhat do you do to relax? Um, listen to music, watch horror movies. I love horror flicks. And I have a Fish Tank too, so I like to watch my fish. I also like to play tennis when I can. I haven't been able to play lately though because of physical problems.\nCan you tell me about that? Um, it's just that I had injured my ankle because I had anemia. And I got dizzy one night and I fell on my ankle and on my leg. So I'm just waiting for that to really heal. But I'm planning on getting back into tennis. It's one of the things I enjoy doing. It really relaxes me.\nHow are you at controlling your temper? I really don't have a temper. Over the years, I've learned how to control that.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? What were you about? Probably would have been yesterday, but there was no argument.\nAnd what was it about? Nothing. But I can recall.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about? Something I feel guilty about? There's nothing right now that I feel guilty about.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The absolute hardest decision that I ever had to make was when my, I have twins, twin boys, they're grown now. I had twins, twin teenagers, and I had lost my job and we were living in a motel. And the rent for the motel was outrageous. I couldn't no longer continue to pay the type of money that they wanted. So I had to briefly put my son in foster care for a minute. That was the hardest decision that I had to make.\nTell me about your kids. What was your first impression of your son? He was schizophrenic. And he had had, he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with speech therapists and school officials. And he also lost his hair when he was four years old. Um, but, and then when he turned 14, the schizophrenia came up. So right now he's in a supportive living environment. He's 27 years old. But he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now. I had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication and give him the medication and he'd hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever. So, but he's come to terms with that and we've all come to terms with that. He's doing, he's doing pretty good. That son, he's 27 too, as I said, because he's a twin, was living in Texas with his wife and he got a promotion to, so now he's in California too. Both are in California. I feel very good about that.\nDo you find it easy to be a parent? Um, well, of grown children, yes. No, I take that back. It's not hard to be a parent of my grown children. When they were younger, there were difficult times, and there were a lot of good times too, but yeah, there were some difficult times.\nCan you tell me more about that? Well, the difficult times I really pretty much already alluded to when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and they were in, temporarily in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia.\nWhat's the hardest thing about being a parent? At this point in my life, there's nothing hard about it.\nWhat's the best thing about being a parent? I don't know, I guess it's just to see something that you created develop into a pretty decent human being, a decent person. That's the best thing.\nWhat are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Oh, a lot of ways. I didn't have two parents. I had a mother and the father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I had no contact with him. But the thing that I do differently than what my mother did, she was a strong disciplinarian, both verbally and physically. Um, and she had this tendency, which she outgrew, to be very critical, opinionated, and very religious, and sort of looked at people who were not, and that was me, as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the Bible and all that kind of thing.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't get a good night's sleep or I don't sleep at all unless I take medication and that's all there is to it. If I don't take medication, I don't sleep. I'll be up all night. I will be up for days if I don't take medication.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? Man, irritable, and tired.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Lately, you know, just a little anxious really. I just recently made a move to a new apartment and it's a lot of expenses and new expenses and things like that, and new furniture and new this and that that you have to get. But I managed to do all that, but the whole thing was kind of stressful.\nDo you always pay off some of your art bills? Yes.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not PTSD.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Yes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed with that? That was back in, I think, 2004.\nWhat got you to see health? Because my life had gotten so stressful to the point where it was either I had to do something or end something, to tell you the truth.\nDo you still get a therapy now? Yes.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful? Yeah, I think it's useful as a good sounding board, someone to throw your concerns out and discuss things that might be bothering you. Well, good things too. Yeah, I think therapy with medication.\nWhat sort of changes have you noticed since you've been here? Since I've been going to therapy, a lot of changes, I've been more focused, more hopeful, it's just been a little bit of a struggle but it's just been a good experience for me which is why I continue to go.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy. Really happy? Well, I can feel really happy by some occurrence. I can't think of anything right now just like that and then I go back to how I was feeling. So I can't really pinpoint anything really. I mean, if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time, that makes me happy. If things go right, how about that?\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something I did recently that I really enjoyed. I can't think of anything.\nHow would your best friend describe you? I don't have a best friend.\nWhat would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities are that I'm an honest person. I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt. Everyone in my book is as they appear to be until they prove it differently. I'm very generous, overly generous. And I like to help other people. I mean, help on a personal level. I help people with anything, whatever their problem is, it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out.\nIs there anything you regret? Anything I regret? How so? Whatever comes to your mind? There's only one thing I regret, and that is that after my twins became old enough to start going to school, at the elementary school level, I was taking some courses as a pre-law major, and at that time I was married to their father who turned out not to be a good fit for me. And because of the stresses involved with him, knowing that that was going to end and I was going to leave him, I dropped out of college. So that was my biggest regret.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay in school, no matter what. Stay the course, no matter what.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life? That I'm a good person. That I'm a good human being. That's all.\nI think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye.\nAre you done? Okay. That was weird. I was a little nervous. Yeah? Well, we'll have you fill in a survey about your experience and then afterwards you may continue.",

I currently attend therapy, and I find it useful as a sounding board. I feel that therapy, along with medication, has been helpful. Since starting therapy, I've noticed changes in myself. I feel more focused and more hopeful, even though it's been a bit of a struggle. I also have trouble sleeping and need medication to get any rest.

         "All right. Great. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes, that's fine.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm okay. How are you?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally?\nOriginally, I'm from San Francisco.\nReally? When did you move to LA?\nOriginally, I moved here in, gosh, 1995. Then I went to Chicago, then to San Francisco, and then back to Los Angeles probably about five years ago.\nWow. A lot of moving. How often do you go back to your hometown?\nNever.\nWhy?\nThere just isn't anything there for me anymore.\nI understand. How does it compare to LA?\nThe weather is better in LA, but the people in San Francisco are nicer.\nYeah. Why is it different to LA?\nMy husband, my ex-husband, prefers it here. That's why we moved.\nOkay. What did you study at school?\nI have an undergraduate degree in psychology, and after that I went to law school.\nThat sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?\nWhen I was in college, I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer. It was really interesting. Are you still working at that?\nNo. Now I'm a stay-at-home mom. Tell me about your kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo. I love it, but it is difficult. You have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person. What's the hardest thing about being a parent?\nIt's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that. I'm good at that. The hardest thing, I think, is to guide them emotionally, to help him through things that he's having a hard time with, feeling like I don't have all the answers. What's the best thing about being a parent?\nJust seeing them grow and experience new things and learn about life and the world. It's really, really cool. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents?\nCompletely different. I am not a perfect parent, but I love my son. I take care of him. He's the first priority in my life, and they weren't like that at all. Tell me about your relationship with your family.\nWell, my parents are dead. I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died. I have a sister and a brother that actually, I don't know where they are. I don't speak to them either.\nOkay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nProbably more shy because I consider myself more reserved. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii. It's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI like to listen to music.\nLike what?\nI listen to all sorts of music, but my favorite when I'm relaxing is 80s music. Cheesy, cheesy, but true. How are you at controlling your temper?\nIt depends on who I'm with. If I'm with my son, I can control my temper. If I'm with my ex-husband or other adults, yeah, I don't. So-so. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nYesterday. It was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married. Can you tell me about that?\nUm, I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her. That sounds really hard.\nYeah. How did you feel in that moment?\nUm, really angry and just really hurt.\nYeah. I'm sorry. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nUm, I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died. I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nThe hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nBecause he was cheating on me. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nUm, that would have to be, well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today. So I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase.\nI see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nI don't get a good night's sleep. It's not easy. I wake up a lot in the night.\nWhy?\nI don't know. I wish I knew. If I knew, I could change it. I could try to do something about it, but I just don't, I don't know. What are you like when you don't sleep well?\nUm, grumpy, irritable. How have you been feeling lately?\nGrumpy, irritable, um, down, mixed with anger. Can you tell me about that?\nIt's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband. What do you have with them?\nUm, I just keep it inside. I mean, there's nothing else to really do except, I mean, it is what it is. So I have to deal with it. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nYes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nTen years ago after my son was born.\nWhat got you to see the health?\nNine years ago. I felt like I couldn't cope with life. I was so down. I couldn't, I felt like I couldn't do anything. Are you triggered by something?\nNo.\nDo you still go to therapy now?\nI don't go to therapy. I go to medication management. But I don't do talk therapy. Is going to a therapist helping you?\nI have gone to therapists and no, they don't help. Can you tell me about that?\nUm, well, some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything. If I wanted to talk to myself, I would. Others give advice that I think is just not good and not on point. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nIt was probably this morning I was playing with my son.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nJust really happy. I wasn't thinking about any of the other crap in my life. I could just forget it. So I was feeling really, really happy. How would your best friend describe you?\nI think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me. I think they would describe me as really sweet because they have really sweet, confident, outgoing, because that's what I try to be to people. So I think that's how they would describe me. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nI wish I wasn't sad. I wish I was more confident. Is there anything you regret?\nYeah, there are a lot of things, I think. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nIt would be to not give my life over to one particular person, which is what I did with my husband. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nI think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son, hanging around the pool, having fun, going out to dinner. Is there someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nTwo of my friends, two really good girlfriends, I think have been really positive influences in my life. Can you tell me about that?\nHer life is worse than mine, but we can always commiserate together. She's just really positive. She's always happy, always up, always looking to the bright side. That's so good to hear. What are you most proud of in your life? Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nI went over to a friend's house and we had movie night. We watched a grown-up movie and had dinner and wine. The boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games. It was just a relaxed, fun evening. That sounds like a great situation. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nSure. Bye.",
         "Okay, here's my story regarding my experiences with depression:\n\nI was diagnosed with depression about ten years ago, a year after my son was born. I sought help because I felt like I couldn't cope with life; I was so down and felt incapable of doing anything. I don't go to talk therapy anymore because I haven't found it helpful. Some therapists just sit there silently, and others give advice that I don't find useful. I am on medication management though. Lately, I've been feeling grumpy, irritable, down, and angry, mainly because of everything I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband. I wish I wasn't sad, and I wish I was more confident. I also don’t sleep well and wake up a lot during the night, which makes me even grumpier.",

         "Okay. Yes. I'm alright. South LA. The weather. The women. The opportunities. That's about it. Racism. Police brutality. Injustice. That's it. No. Not much of a exploring type of person. Psychology. It was one of the classes I excelled in the most. So I decided to change it from business to psychology. Yeah, yes. No. It's on my own record label. How hard is that? Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? Why? I'm not. What do you do to relax? Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best it's got. That's good. How are you at controlling your hunger? I think I'm pretty decent now compared to how I used to be. Is that something you're controlling? Yes, ma'am. Can you tell me about that? Due to the lack of, I guess you could say, controlling my emotions, I have got incarcerated and sent to prison. Yeah. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made to make. I'm not sure. I don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision I've ever made in my life. When was the last time you argued with someone and argued it out? It was probably a few days ago with the girl I was talking to and I was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness. How did you feel around her? Frustrated. Because you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship. And at the same time when you have expectations, sometimes you kind of set yourself up for failure. I guess I'm just learning. Tell me about a situation that you would have handled differently. There are a lot of situations I would have handled differently. Probably the most recent was I got into a physical altercation with an inmate when I was incarcerated. And that's what sent me to prison and I had to do a lot more time. And if I handled it differently, I probably would have never went to prison. I probably would have been home a lot sooner than what originally happened. Tell me about events or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. There are several events I wish I could erase from my memory. Probably my first girlfriend. She did something really extreme. It wasn't necessary in my eyes. And it could have cost me my life. I think that's a recurring thought that I wish I could completely erase my memory, along with the good memories as well. A few fights. I guess you could say shootouts. Getting jumped, getting robbed. Those things I think those inhibit me, I guess, to explore certain areas of life that I'm not comfortable with. So those are the few things that would be nice if I could erase it completely. What's something you feel guilty about? Hurting people I didn't need to be hurt emotionally, especially a few women in my life or in my past. Probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through, along with my close friends and family as well. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It used to be rocky growing up. But as I got older and matured and the certain experiences that I've been through kind of brought me closer to my family. So now it's pretty decent. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? My mother. Can you tell me about that? She had her share of experiences, negative and positive. I admire her. The struggles she's been through. She experienced difficult economic hardships growing up, but that didn't stop her from raising a son at a young age, finishing school, getting her masters, and just overall being a good person. And she also battled mental health issues as well. Okay, I think I've asked everything you need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. You can have a look at your computer. We'll finish up with a post survey about your experience.",
         "Okay, so, looking back on things, I think a big part of my struggles comes from not being able to control my emotions. It led to me getting incarcerated and doing time in prison. There are definitely things I wish I could erase from my memory, like what happened with my first girlfriend – it was a really bad situation that could have cost me my life. Also, some of the fights and violence I've been through still affect me; they make me afraid to explore new things. I also feel guilty about hurting people emotionally, especially women in my past, and putting my mom through tough times. But, you know, my mom has been a huge positive influence. She went through so much, including her own battles with mental health, and still managed to raise me and build a good life.",

         "Okay, that looks good.\n\nShe'll let you know when you guys are done.\n\nOkay. Yeah, sure. I'm good. How are you? I'm from Florida originally. Where are you from? For work. How long have you been back to Florida? I haven't been back in a few months. How did you get into Florida? It was pretty easy. It's not that much of a difference except I guess the buildings are bigger. What do you like about Florida? I like the weather and I like the environment of Hollywood, I guess. What do you hate about the city? I hate the transportation system and the traffic, it's really bad. I'm sure you can tell from the screen, you're not missing the road. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, I've traveled a lot around America. What do you like about America? I like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff. I guess it's just relaxing and it's fun. What was your favorite place to visit? I went to Canada once. My mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there. I didn't like the cold. What was your favorite food? What did you like about that particular trip? She made us this Canadian food called poutine or something. That was a new experience. Sometimes when I'm doing something, I come up with a new experience. Hey, sometimes not a lot, but it's a precious time. What do you do when you're relaxing? I try to get out in the sun and go to the beach or something or read a book. I'm pretty okay. It depends on how bad the situation is. Two days ago, I was arguing with my sister about something. What was your favorite thing to do? I don't know. I guess think more before I talk and maybe I won't lose my temper. What was your favorite thing to do? Something I wish I could erase from my memory. I guess negative people that I've met before. I guess I just want to erase the thought of meeting them. What was your hardest decision? The hardest decision I've had to make. I don't know. I guess what I wanted to study in college maybe. It's not that hard, but it's a big decision. What did you study? Computer science. Are you still working on it? Yeah, a little bit. Not as much, but a little bit. How did you get into it? I got into it when I was a teenager. I was good at it. I figured I'd go on studying at a higher level. Are you still working on it? Yeah, somewhat. I was trying to make a decision between that and the arts. I'm just happy I did it though. What did you dream about? A dream job? A fashion designer. How hard is it? How hard is the job? I don't think it's a hard job. I like clothes and fabric and making clothes like that. I don't think it's a hard job. How do you sleep? I fall asleep within five minutes, depending on how tired I am. What do you do when you're tired? I'm very irritable. I'm very irritable and not good to be around when I'm tired. And I can't focus. How do you feel about your job? I've been feeling good. Fine. Have you ever been in a relationship? No. How did you get the last time you felt really happy? The last time I felt really happy... I guess like a week or so ago I went to... I went to... There we go. I went to this event downtown. It was like an art walk thing, so it was exciting. Awesome. Thanks. What do you think about your job? I think I'm a good friend. I think I'm hardworking. And... what else? Yeah, that's it. Do you regret anything? Um... Do you think I regret? Not really. Well yeah, I regret not contacting old friends that I knew. So I guess maybe I'll do that in the future. How do you know them? I know them from elementary school. But we lost contact through the years. Because I switched schools. How do you guys spend your time? Really badly, you know? Um... I can't think of it. I guess I was in... I was in an elevator one time and this person was running towards it. And I was trying to hold it for them, but I couldn't reach in time and they started cursing me out. So I felt really bad because they probably thought I didn't try to open it for them. But yeah. It was sad. How do you guys spend your time? For now? Okay. Um... I don't know, I guess I would just say... Um... Learn as much as I can and... I don't know, just don't hold back so much. With like um... Like not being outgoing and stuff, I guess I just tell myself to be more outgoing. How do you guys spend your time? Um... I think they'd say the same thing I said earlier. That I'm generous, patient, hardworking, and... What else did I say? Um... Kind? I hope they'd say that. How do you feel about being an intellectual? Um... I am proud of my intelligence. Okay. Okay, bye. Take care. Bye. That was weird.",

And it's not that I like it, but that's just where my parents were, so that's where I grew up. Nothing, that's right there, I love LA. Maybe that is ghetto, but that's about it. I was thinking of going for sound engineer or mechanic, but I'm not sure. Because my dad, he used to do that. I'm not even sure to be honest. I really thought about it.\n\nI can look at your shoes.\nNah, I don't travel like that. I don't know, maybe money issue or something. I have a lot of money, I go all over the world.\n\nProbably outgoing. Depends I guess. About what? Shy or outgoing? Outgoing, you could be outgoing at a party, you know. You're already out there, so you can be shy if you're going to a party.\n\nI'm good. Probably my girlfriend, because I miss work, because I just feel lazy. I was like, whatever, I just didn't want to go and I do what I want. I just didn't go.\n\nNah, not really. She's already there. As long as we have the bills and rent paid. Don't worry.\n\nGuilty. Probably nothing. I'm not sure if I'm going to work. Damn, I get raised from that. Probably bad friends that I've met. Friends that trick you, that just trick you. Friends that deceive you, I guess. Okay, like my friend told me that he had a good job at some car wash place. So he told me to, he's going to get me hired there and get me a direct deposit. But then he ended up actually going into my account and taking money from my account. So...\n\nProbably moving out and into my mom's house. Yeah, I haven't really been around, man. Like a big decision like that. I want my own space, my own life. I want to do what I want. Come home when I want, leave when I want. Yeah. And we're all close. We hardly argue. We're always around. We always see each other. My mom, my dad, my brother.\n\nHow they were positive in my life?\nWell, they're always there for you. Whether you have financial problems, they're there. They help you out. Whether you're sad, they know it and they blame what's wrong. They're always there to motivate you and keep you going.\n\nHow easy was it to move out?\nEasy. Actually, yeah, pretty easy.\n\nWhen did you learn about the U.S.?\nI'm sorry?\n\nWhen did you learn about the U.S.?\nI haven't noticed, but maybe... Probably the same. I don't think sleep does affect you, but I don't know. Maybe more tired, but I don't think annoyed or mad or anything like that.\n\nHow do you feel about the U.S.?\nGood. Everything's great. Maybe that I want to start a new business or something.\n\nDo you have a new business?\nWell, like my dad, he wasn't around for a while, but he just got back. He actually opened up a shop and he's getting a lot of customers. So it seems that his business is growing, so I'm probably going to learn mechanics, like I was saying earlier. That's cool.\n\nHave you ever been by the pool?\nI don't even know what it is.\n\nHave you been by the pool?\nNo.\n\nHave you played games?\nNope.\n\nHow do you love your basketball?\nI'm sorry?\n\nHow do you love your basketball?\nYesterday, last night, because I got a new game. Awesome.\n\nWhat do you say when you hear a comment?\nThat not funny?\n\nDo you have a new girlfriend?\nNo.\n\nWhat are some things you would like to change about your life?\nI don't think nothing. Everything's fine, you know. Thank God everything's good right now. I don't think there's nothing to change like that.\n\nWhat kind of job?\nMaybe a better job. Well, first of all, I don't even have a job. So I guess to change I'll get a job. It's hard for someone to put me down like that.\n\nDo you see a part of that I'm responsible as well?\nI don't know.\n\nShe was components of 20 years ago when I gave that one almost nine years, because she was having hard time paying bills and rents.

         "Okay. Here's the cleaned transcript:\n\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just creative to talk to people and think into their environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started, and please feel free to comment on anything. Your answers are very important. Are you okay with this?\nYes, I am.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing very good today.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nI'm originally from Chicago, Illinois. Moved out here when I was three.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI never go back.\nWhy?\nFamily issues. I see. How does it compare to LA life?\nIt depends on what you're into. If you're into the fast life in Hollywood, it doesn't compare at all. If you're into the cold weather, then you would rather be out there. I like the sun.\nMm-hmm. What's the difference?\nMy mom and my dad split up.\nI'm sorry.\nIt's okay. How easy was it for you to move to the US?\nI have no idea. I was only three when I moved out here.\nOkay. What are some things you really like about LA?\nI like the sunshine. I like the weather. I like the balance of the weather we have in the spring, winter, fall, and the summer. I like the beaches. I like Hollywood. I like that the Lakers are here. I love the people. It's a different variety. I think LA is a microcosm of the United States. People from all over the world come to the United States and people from all over the country and all over the world. They come to LA for a better opportunity. That's what I like about LA.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nGang violence.\nHi, Mr. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nNo, not really. I've traveled one time to Arizona and one time to Stockton, California, and another time to Barstow, California, but I don't do much traveling right now, mainly because of finances.\nWhat did you study at school?\nI studied alcohol and drug counseling.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nI just felt it in my heart that that's what I was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions. That was a kind of easy choice. I got some advice from people and I just went into it to do it just to see what it was. I finished school and did an internship and got hired. I believe that's what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.\nAre you still working on that?\nI'm not working right now. I actually moved away and I was married and we had to move away. We moved away because renting was cheaper, so I actually had to give up that job in order to make that move. Since I came back down, I've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so I can get back into counseling.\nHow hard is that?\nIt can be very difficult at times because I have a felony. I can't work with the youth and I can't work with the elderly, but the regular adults, I can. Then you have to be certified and I'm not certified yet. You have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified. Before they even allow you to take the test, you have to work a certain amount of hours. Right now I'm just trying to get into interns, try to intern and show people what I can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume. They just want people to be certified. Not being certified, the experience and the fact that I have a felony makes it hard.\nWhat's your dream job?\nMy dream job is to open my own facility or as an author.\nDo you consider yourself a shy or a felon?\nThat depends on people. I mainly adapt my personality to the people that I'm around. If people are perky, then I'm going to be perky. If they're standoffish, then I may seem shy, but I'm not shy. I'm just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up. If people open up right away, then I open up right away. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's a trusted guy.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI mainly listen to music or I watch YouTube, write poetry, or just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like I can sing, which I can't. Another thing I do is I eat ice cream.\nTell me about controlling your temper.\nControlling my temper, I'm very, very good at it. It depends on what it is. I have to say that the last time I lost my temper was because I felt like somebody was scaring my mother. I lost my temper, but 99 times out of 100, I don't lose my temper. I don't like to raise my voice. I just like to be calm and cool. I like everybody to be comfortable. I don't want anybody to be frightened or anything. There's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it. I just believe that, and I believe angry outbursts to be a link to heart problems and high blood pressure. I definitely don't want that.\nTell me about a situation that you were seeing in a different way.\nWell, I was just telling you about, it was my mother's husband. To tell you the truth, I could have handled that differently, but when I seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear, I just lost it. I snapped. I told my mother, I don't like this. You need to take care of this because I don't know how long I can keep my composure as far as this. I've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother, but that's her husband. I kept my distance in their relationship, but when I saw her having fear in her eyes, that triggered a part of me that I don't like very much because I know if I get angry, I usually stay angry for a long time. So I should have just left. I should have just left and went home and rested and got up in the next morning and went to church. But yeah, we had a big time explosion and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months. So yeah, those six to nine months, I can't get back. That's very hard.\nYes. Tell me about your relationship with your family.\nWell, my brother's in prison. I haven't seen him in 20 years. He's been there 20 years. My sister moved to Chicago 13 years ago. I haven't seen her since then. So I'm only close to my mother. And my son, I haven't seen him in five years and I'm still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and how that's going to turn out for me. I just, you know, I have a small family and I have family in Chicago, but I don't mess around with that side of the family just because of what I've seen and heard. So I just don't want it to happen to me at all. So I just keep my distance.\nIs there someone who's been a positive influence in your life?\nSomeone who's been a positive influence in my life, I would say... Taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me expressing my emotions, being threatening to someone else. And taught me how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are. And when they're really strong, that's when I just need to be quiet until that intense fizzling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not just emotionally. And of course, he's he was the one that told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor. My father, he's got 27 years clean and sober right now. He used to live on Skid Row and the way he changed his life around and, you know, the way he approached me as a father was just something that I'll never forget.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about?\nFeel guilty about? My grandfather. He passed away in 2004 and at that time I was just getting out of prison. 2002 I was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't going to be around for that much longer. But I didn't get it because I had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that I considered to be more important than that. Plus the fact I didn't understand him, what he was saying. But when he died, I figured out that he was telling me that I should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go. But I couldn't see it then. And I feel I think about it all the time.\nOkay. Tell me about home or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nSomething I could erase from my memory? What made a day my brother hit my mom? I always replay that over and over in my mind. And it's like that's one memory I can just go without replaying my mind over and over again. So yeah, that memory right there.\nHow did you feel about that memory?\nI felt conflicting feelings. Because on one hand, my brother was protecting me from getting beat. And on the other hand, he was hitting my mom. So it's kind of in the middle.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nMost nights I don't. I go to sleep maybe three in the morning. And I'm probably I'm more than likely up at seven in the morning. So I don't get much sleep. It depends on the environment I'm in. If I don't sleep well. I'm going eventually I'm going to be irritable, but it doesn't happen right away. It depends on my environment and who's around me. If they're difficult people, that's going to be a challenge for me. And if people are easy going, no one will even know that I didn't get much sleep.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI've just been feeling like that things are about to start going better for me. Making some better decisions. Taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me. Taking advantage of my talents. Taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me. So I'm very enthusiastic about that. Even if it doesn't happen, I'll send out a million resumes. I don't care if I get five interviews. I will never stop because I know that being a counselor is my life mission. And I'm also destined to be a writer. And it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people know about me because I've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that. And I have a lot to offer humanity. So it's just a matter of time before that the public is exposed to what I've been gathering.\nHow do you understand that you're using your behavior in front of people?\nMy behavior? I'm more mellow. I laugh more. I'm more humorous. I let a lot of things go that I used to just let tick me off and anger me. And things that I can't control, like trying to control people or trying to make sure people don't betray me. And you just can't control that. I matured mentally and psychologically. And the acquisition of a sense of humor was a major, major breakthrough for me. So I know my thoughts have changed. And with my thoughts changing, my behavior has changed. I still have to monitor it. My thoughts and my behavior, I still have to monitor them. But overall, back then I just tolerated myself. Now I actually like myself. And it will behoo you to feel the same way.\nOkay. Have you ever been diagnosed with dysplasia?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nLast time I felt happy was last night because the Lakers won the basketball game.\nAwesome. How do your best friends describe you?\nMy best friend would describe me, he calls me the truth.\nWhy?\nBecause I always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and I always reveal it. They can't hide it from me. I have a statement that says I see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it. And I see stuff days and months before they start happening. I know human behavior when I see it and I sniff it out real well. And it's just a gift that was given to me. So he calls me the truth because of how I interact with people and how people have to come clean with me. Because when they look at me, they know that I see through them. Like I said, like a clear glass with nothing in it. And yes, that's why he calls me the truth.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nI wish I would have never, well, obviously I wish I would have never went to prison. I wish that I could change, well, my economic status, my employment status, and my teeth. That's like a problem area for me. I did a lot of stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and I didn't take care of my teeth. And now that I need to be confident about myself as I can be, it always comes up every now and then, the thought, like, I wonder if they're looking at my teeth. I wonder if they're looking at my teeth. I never get the impression that they are, but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says, are they looking at my teeth? So I would really change that. And I would change my physical size. I think I would like to be at least 35 pounds heavier, but I'm working on it. 20 years ago, which would make me 18, I would have, at that time I was a big time high school basketball player for Freedman High School and I had colleges coming to see me and I would have given myself the opportunity to stay away from the troublemakers because I didn't and I blew my opportunity to play college basketball for Duke Blue Devils and who knows, I could have been playing for the Lakers last night. But, hey.\nI'm most proud of what?\nI'm most proud of my mom. Really. She graduated from school. She had a full-time job. She would wake up at 5 in the morning, go to work, get off her job at 3.30, go straight to the college, leave the college at 9 o'clock at night. She does this five days a week and still had the strength to maintain. She was on the Dean's List and the President's List, so doing all of this, you know, when they say that older people can't do things, I just think that dispels that rumor. And she recently got her license as an evangelist in the church, so I'm just real proud of that. Her life has been affecting people in a positive way. So, yeah, my mom.\nOkay, thank you. Goodbye. Okay, thank you.",
         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I often struggle to get a good night's sleep, usually going to bed around 3 AM and waking up at 7 AM. This lack of sleep can make me irritable, especially if I'm in a difficult environment. I also have a memory of my brother hitting my mom that replays in my mind often, and it brings up conflicting feelings. I wish I could erase it.",

         "Okay, that looks good. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing fine.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nMexico.\nReally? When did you move to LA?\nWhen I was young, seven years old.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI've been there like three or four times for vacation.\nHow does it compare to LA?\nWell, it's less stressful. I don't know if it's because I'm on vacation, but I feel more at peace over there than here.\nWhy did you move to LA?\nWell, my family moved down here for a better life. That was my parents.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nJust the weather and different things that you could do. You could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains. Different variety of things to do.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic. Yeah, basically the traffic. That's one of the main things.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nNot that much. I've been to New York and Mexico only.\nCool. What do you enjoy about traveling?\nJust seeing new places and finding new locations. Something new.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? Like for a trip?\nYeah. Well, I've been to Mexico. I've been to the pyramids of what I forgot to call Mexico City. I like finding out about my ancient culture since I'm Mexican. From my genetics, I like to see different things like that.\nThat's great. What did you study at school?\nWell, at school, I did dropout but I came back and I'm trying to get back into it right now. I'm trying to learn graphic design.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nWell, I started liking to take pictures, doing different things. I like going into business. I like what the title is about.\nWhat's your dream job?\nI want to have my own business. Either making web pages, just be able to be free and don't be relying on someone else. Just be able to have freedom for myself.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nOutgoing.\nWhy?\nI just like to be around people, like to get to know people, depending on the person and how I feel around them.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI like to hear music or do different things like play sports or do different things just to unwind.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nWell, I'm getting better at it.\nWhat was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about?\nWell, it was like two days ago. It was something about I needed to pay a bill or something that I had taken care of. But the person, he's more picky about it. He knows how girls are. They want everything right there and then. I have a handle. I have everything there. And they're just bugging. Sometimes they don't give you the space that you need to resolve something.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nWell, I felt like I was overwhelmed. I already had it resolved. I just was waiting for a check. It's not on my control, but I already had made the proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it. It's like you're making an argument, a storm in a glass of water.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nWell, differently, there's a couple of them, but not so recently because I've been more trying to get my life together. But the decisions I made before in the past, I dropped out of school and doing other different things.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about?\nGuilty? Not that much because not really. Not that I can think right off the top of my head.\nOkay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nThe hardest decision? It's just not on top of my head right now.\nOkay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nAn event? Well, the only things that I remember is when I blacked out or different things like that that I don't remember. But nothing like a particular, only when my brothers died and different things like that.\nCan you tell me about that?\nWell, my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble. And it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much, get into it.\nOkay. Tell me about your relationship with your family.\nNo, I'm Hispanic. I like to be with my family. And I like to go over there to Mexico too. I have a half sister and my grandpa died. He was over there in Mexico. So I like to have a good relationship with my family.\nThat's good. Who's son of it's been a positive influence in your life?\nWell, my mom and dad, they always work hard. They always done what they have to do to pay the bills. That's why sometimes I'd be like, you know, running around trying to get everything done, but done correctly, not trying to take the easy way out.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's a little hard because they're, especially here in Los Angeles, there's a lot of different things that you could get into that's not that positive. And it's hard to stay focused on, you know, the correct stuff.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nWell, normally I just knock out. It's not that hard. It's like, it takes me like half an hour or 15 minutes. But sometimes I can't even wake up even with the alarm. They have to wake me up. You know, my girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on. It's like so hard. You know, I just knock out.\nWhat are you like when you're dusting off?\nI do get a little, either I'm angry or I don't feel good and I don't feel with energy. But I still have to know, I know I have to do something, so I still go through with it.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI've been, well, I've been feeling good, you know, doing a little restless, but not that much. I have to do stuff, so I just, you know, put myself to do it no matter how I feel.\nHave you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?\nNo, nothing out of the ordinary.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nThe last time I felt happy, that was probably on the weekend that I was, you know, going out with, going out to have some fun and, you know, I was drinking and just relaxing and winding down.\nAwesome. Mm-hmm. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nMy ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home, just relax. But nothing else, you know, just be able to relax and unwind with her, you know, either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home, but without getting any calls or any interruptions. You know, just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything and just be with her doing other different things.\nYeah. Mm-hmm. How are your best friends around you?\nLike an outgoing guy, you know, very social, but at the same time I'm reserved depending how I feel with people. I have to, you know, build trust or feel comfortable with them.\nUh-huh. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nWell, I'm changing a lot, you know, like my temper and different things, drinking things. I'm changing a lot of different things so I could get more different things done.\nTell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself.\nWell, there's several, but mostly is when I'm coming from Mexico that they want to demean you even down there. It feels like silly because I went to a store, I was regularly dressed, and I was telling them I wanted to buy something, and then they said that I wasn't belong there. And as soon as they saw my credit card, they kind of changed perspective because they saw the Wells Fargo logo, they know it was American. But they thought it was like, you know, it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place, you have the money, you ask for something, you can ask for something because you have it, not just to kill their time. Just because they saw a logo of a card, that's how they, you know, it just, it was ridiculous for me.\nI understand. Is there anything you regret?\nNo.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nBasically, to stay more focused on different things, stay in school, and, you know, don't go, you know, try to control my temper and do different things. Because if I knew what I know now, back then, it would be different.\nHmm. What are you most proud of in your life?\nWell, I did drop out, but I did go back to school and, you know, I did get my high school. And right now I'm in the process of doing other different things. So right now it's getting my high school, getting that together. And right now I'm working to another goal and trying to get, you know, my, either going back to school. So basically getting back to school and finishing the high school, the GED.\nThat's so good to hear. Mm-hmm. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nOkay. You're welcome. Bye.\nOkay. Stop the recordings.\nMm-hmm. I feel like that works like I thought it would.",
         "Okay, here’s a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nI haven't been diagnosed with depression. When asked, I said I have not been diagnosed with depression. I've been feeling good lately, though a little restless, but I push myself to do things anyway. I don’t think I’ve experienced any changes in my behavior or thoughts lately. I do get angry or feel bad and without energy when I don't get enough sleep, but I still push myself to do what I need to do. The last time I felt really happy was on the weekend when I went out to have fun, drink, relax and unwind.",

         "Okay. So once again, when she says that, I'm going to go ahead.\n...for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue to provide for them comfortably.\nWhat did you study at school?\nI studied communications actually. I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now I'm studying business.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nI just thought that you know there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs and then I have a desire to go to graduate school so I just figured in the long run it would put me in a better position, give me more opportunities with the communications. It's a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of TV reporting and things like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so I just thought I would go into something more realistic and you know but I like both fields. I really do. I like communicating, writing, reading, talking as you can tell and so we'll see.\nWhat's your dream job?\nA couple probably but I would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer, going to different destinations, trying different foods out, writing about different people, cultures, learning and living you know about those different people and cultures living amongst the people there and being interactive with the children and stuff like that so I kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor, social worker, something in that area. If I could encompass all three hopefully I can. I would like to do that.\nThat's actually a hard question probably because I initially grew up very shy and I'm not so much shy as I am reserved now but not conservative but just reserved and you know when I go somewhere I'm checking everything, everybody else out and then once I become comfortable or acclimate to a situation then I'm like okay you know I warm up to the situation or the people but I'm also friendly. I can be very friendly and outgoing. I like to talk. You know I seem like a chatterbox but I'm not really so usually if I'm in a big space with a whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention. I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but overall I am an open friendly person.\nFor me it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything, all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating, praying or reading a good spiritual scripture. If I'm able to I like to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, you know things that will I kind of like the physical part of it. I like massages, things that really release tension. And if not then just like I said just sitting at home reading and praying or I like the beach. I love the beach so sometimes I drive and go sit by the beach. I also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani-pedi or maybe go window shopping. You know things like that.\nPretty good. Sometimes I'm just like I don't really have so much issue with the temper as I am. I just I'm more impatient. Unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so I just can become really irritated or irritable, quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me and just lose patience. Outside of that I'm actually pretty good. I try to be very conscious of where I'm at and be very patient with people especially if I can see that the person is like if they're a new checkout person at the counter or cashier I do try to be patient and understanding because I would want that you know if it were me I would want someone to extend that to me. You know with my kids sometimes you know it works both ways too. If it's that time of the month I'm just like just leave me alone or I might have a short temper or a short fuse. So I am conscious of it. I try to be aware of it and try to monitor it but you know like anybody I'm human in their times or I have my days or moments when I could just like go off and just lose it.\nWhat was the last time you argued with someone?\nUm well I haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been an ongoing thing with American Express. So I would say because it was not a personal contact but a company I we it really was an argument but you know I had some issues with American Express I had to call in about on I think Saturday and I kept I wasn't getting the response I expected and so I would the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and I was upset and you know the rep was trying to over talk me and then I was trying to over talk her. So you know I don't know if you would consider that an argument but I would definitely say that's the last time when you know I just kind of like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning. That one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nProbably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express. Actually it was on Sunday. Yeah and I know the person was trying to help me but you know when you're constantly being told different things and I've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved. It just takes you there. So just I kept raising my voice said some things I shouldn't have and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact. I like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there. My blood pressure was raised. Excuse me. And that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that. Just irritable and agitated and upset. And so I always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how I could you know handle things differently. But that's one I definitely wish I could have kept my cool and been more level headed and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite.\nOkay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nHmm. Well I probably have had a couple but probably the most is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and I was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time. And he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time. And I wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby. But he put me under so much stress and you know kind of I want to say really pushed me into having terminating the pregnancy. And that's always stayed with me and I've always missed that pregnancy that child I think about that that baby or what could have been. I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it. But I know deep down I secretly if I had it to do all over again I would have just I would have kept the baby and move forward. So that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally. I could deal with a lot and I have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know a lot of financial problems. But that to me was the hardest.\nThank you.\nNo. No.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nOkay you know I was laid off in December so I've been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet. So that's been a little tough. I've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school. So my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place about five years ago. Well she's been able to move forward and going with her life and now she's graduating in next month from USC with her master's in social work. So I'm feeling a little envious of that and I have been for like the past year but more so recently although I'm very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it. But you know of course you've done a lot of what she was me so that too has kind of been bothering me. Hi Ms. Lola.\nWhat would you say are some of your best qualities?\nWell I'm really good with people. I communicate well. I like to talk. I'm really good with children. That's why I would like to teach or be a counselor. Although I have not really tapped into it I know I'm a very creative person. I know I write pretty good. I could possibly be a creative writer but I know I'm very creative. So if given the opportunity I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills. Something like with maybe songwriting, fiction writing, probably like interior decorating. Anything artistic. Just anything because I love music. I love the arts. I love drama. I love plays. I'm not a big fashion buff but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that. So I think those are my strong points as well as just getting along with people. I know I will make a great counselor. My friends come to me all the time. I have a good ear for listening. I'm a great mediator and I know how to because I've been through a lot. One of my friends called me the voice of reason. The one that's actually graduating from SC. I know I'm light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom. I don't know if it has to do with having older parents myself or how I grew up. I had very traditional southern parents who instilled a lot of great values in me. Or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign, I'm a Pisces. I'm really good with people. Just period. Like I said, I have my moments but I know if it's something I could go into and develop, I would do well.\nIs there anything you regret?\nNot really. Some of the situations. I wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children. Picked a different partner. I say that because my son's father is great. A great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me. We're not together. I'm just saying overall. I think I would say, if I could let me backtrack that, not finishing school when I should have. Not following my dreams and goals and doing things as I was planning initially. I think that would be the one thing I could say I regret. Not following my goals and finishing school on time and pursuing what I really wanted to do.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nStay focused and finish school. Pick a career path and stay on that. Stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nI think I'm pretty stable and consistent. Overall, how I face adversity. How I face things. I'm a pretty committed person. If I say I'm going to do something, I try to stick to it. I'm a very loyal friend. I've done a pretty good job with raising my kids.\nSo long. Great. Thank you. Bye bye.",
         "Looking back, there have been periods where I really struggled. After being laid off, facing child support issues, and trying to juggle school and job hunting, my emotions were all over the place. I felt envious of a friend who was graduating with her Master's, knowing I wanted to be where she was. The hardest decision I ever made was years ago, when I was pressured into terminating a pregnancy. That has always stayed with me, and I still think about that child. While I've faced a lot of challenges, that remains the most emotionally difficult thing I've gone through.",

         "Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get it started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm wonderful. How are you?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally?\nCalifornia.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nThe weather is one of them. The food and the way everything is centrally located.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic, the smog, and it's just gotten really overcrowded.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nI wouldn't say a lot, but I do try to travel at least once or twice every two years.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nJust exploring different things and being able to have different experiences, things of that nature, and learning new things and just different cultures. I like to learn about different cultures, and when you travel, you get a sense of feedback from different cultures and different areas. So I like that. I'd love to hear about your trips.\nI just came from Miami last year. I went to Miami for a week and a half. It was really nice. The weather was great. It was my first time going. The weather was wonderful. The people were really nice. It was really a great experience. I went out there for a particular event. They have something every year where everyone comes out from all over. You just kind of party and hang out and meet new people. It was really fun.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nFrom that trip, I would say swimming in the beautiful Miami beach waters. It was wonderful.\nThat sounds like a great situation.\nYeah, it was.\nWhat did you study at school?\nChild development.\nThat sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?\nWell, I've always been interested in children since I was younger. I babysat a lot, so I had a lot of experience with kids at a young age. As I grew older, I realized that it was something that I liked to do. That's when I looked into child development courses. I thought that it was something that I would enjoy doing. I started taking classes, and the rest is history.\nAre you still working on that?\nI am, yes. It's been 15 years in August.\nWow. What's your dream job?\nMy dream job? I would say to become a principal.\nWhy?\nWell, it's something that I've thought about doing for a while now. I've actually just began the steps to try to get that going. I'm going to be back in school, and I'm going to be taking courses so that I can make that happen, because it is a dream of mine.\nThank you. How hard is that?\nIt's going to be pretty difficult. There is several years of schooling that I have ahead of me. It's definitely going to be a challenge, but it's something that I'm up for because it is a dream job of mine. It's something that I'm willing to do.\nI understand. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nA little bit of both, I think. I can be shy at times, and outgoing as well.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI meditate. I'm a big meditator, so I love meditating. I love reading and having a nice, quiet, peaceful time.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nOh, wow. I'm very good at that. Again, a series of meditations that I do, it involves deep breathing and just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heartbeat, and you can really feel everything in your body.\nThat's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nIt's about just the way he responds sometimes to me. It can be a little aggressive. We're just trying to work with that because I don't respond well to aggression. I totally tune out, and that's actually what happened. Yeah, that was it.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nI felt very frustrated, and I actually felt angered too, but more frustrated. I felt saddened too because I don't like arguing, so it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nA situation which I wish I would have handled differently. Honestly, I haven't had a situation like that in years. I've pretty much mastered my responses to certain stimuli. I've got that down.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nThe hardest decision I've ever had to make? Well, it was when I was 16 years old, and I became a teenage mother. I was pregnant at 16, and I had a lot of pressure from family to give my child up for adoption or to abort. I chose life, so that was one of the hardest decisions, if not the hardest decisions, to make as a 16-year-old teenager. Whether I wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager, or whether I wanted to embark on raising a life when I was just a child myself. That, I think, was the hardest decision I had to make.\nHow do you cope with them?\nWell, my son is almost 19 now, so it's 19 years later. I actually am so glad it was one of the best things that I ever did by not choosing to abort him. Being pro-life, pro-choice, pro-life. I have not regretted the decision. That's my only child, and I love him. He is just a blessing, and I feel very special to be his mom.\nDo you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo, it's not easy. It definitely has its difficulties, just as anything.\nWhat are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents?\nThe first way is I actually listen to my son, and I accept his feedback, even if I don't like it. I allow him to express himself. Unfortunately, when I was little, there was not a lot of conversation from parent to child. It was more like we were just told what to do, and we did it. With my son, I give him options. I allow him to express himself. I allow him to give me feedback, negative or positive. I feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age. As parents, you have to be supportive in that and make sure that you nurture that, because that's the way that they develop.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nIt depends. It really depends. It depends on the time that I go to sleep. It depends on the time that I woke up. There are a lot of factors. I can't just give you one answer. I would say that it varies. Sometimes I can go to sleep and fall asleep right away, and other times I can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep. It varies.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI've been feeling great lately. I really have been. I can't say that the last week didn't affect me, the argument with my husband. Other than that, I've been feeling really good.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo, I haven't.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo, I have not.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nYou know what? Honestly, I feel happy every day. Every day I wake up, I'm happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage. Carpe diem sees the day. I feel blessed. Every morning I wake up, it's a blessing because I realize that some people did not wake up. Some people are homeless. Some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening. That's not me. I feel really, really blessed every day.\nThat's great. Thank you. How are your best friends around you?\nAs nurturing, patient, loving, friendly, kind of reserved.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nWell, I wish that I had already completed college and had my master's degree. Sometimes I wish I was a little bit more knowledgeable in certain subjects. If I could change anything, I would change that, those two things. Also, I would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert.\nIs there anything you regret?\nYou know what? No regrets. You live and learn. Nothing is perfect. Everything that I've gone through has made me the person that I am today. So I wouldn't change anything because I'm happy with the person that I am today.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nOh man, to stay in school. To stay in school and to get your education and to put that first and foremost before a relationship, even before your career, I really, really would have told myself to stay focused and to get a great education.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nI'm most proud of where I've come from as a teenage mother. Being a statistic and actually changing that. Being on my same job for 15 years now, I'm really proud of that. I've been married for 13 years. I'm really proud of that. Happily married to my best friend and my soulmate. Nothing's perfect, but he's my best friend and I love him. I'm also proud of my son being the mother that I am and the son that I've raised. I'm proud of the job that I've done. I really applaud myself for that.\nOkay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're welcome. You were wonderful. Thank you. Bye-bye.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally welcome. I'm going to be your guide. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Spectacular. This is an interesting experiment. Awesome. Where are you from originally? I am from the United States. I am from the middle of nowhere, Iowa. Really? When did you move to LA? May 2, 2007. Exactly five years ago. Six years ago. And frequently, like once every couple of years. Okay. How does it compare to LA? The weather exists so it's more extreme. And then it's rather less exciting, a lot less colorful. Why'd you move to LA? Uh, winter in Minnesota. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Uh, it took approximately the drive in. That's about all it took. The lights took care of the rest. Wow. What are some things you really like about LA? I really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime, so that bicycles have free reign of the streets. I like all the art. I love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together, and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about your trips. What's one of your most memorable experiences? What's your favorite part of your trip? That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Can you tell me about that? That's great. Sometimes when I'm being intense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? How are you at controlling your temper? When was the last time you argued with someone? When did it happen? That time was really hard. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. What's something you feel guilty about? Why? Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. What made you decide to do that? Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you lately? Can you tell me about that? You hit me with the best inspiration words. There's the part where she actually works on the exact things that make me excited. There's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance. And then there's the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time. All of those things are really nice, but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return, that's smitten. How do you know them? What a funny question. How do I know them as though she's multiple people? How did you know? How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? What are you like in your sleep now? Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Why? I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the Arthur C. Clarke sense. So as a fortunate and vaguely aware being, it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yeah. My excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate. And I'm feeling more and more inspired all the time. If I could just work on the motivation, I'd be set. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with sleep-sickness? Not since you asked me on the forum a little while ago, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. I used to think I had it, but who knows at this point. That was a while ago. Can you tell me about that? I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time. And then I moved to Los Angeles and started having fun. And then the rest is ancient history. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. 2013. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Awesome. How would your best friend describe you? What would you say are some of your best friends? I guess I'm enthusiastic. I am... ...phasoric. And I am... I'm going to have to say highly analytical. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Like what? What are you most proud of in your life? That's a really tough one. I think the thing that I'm most proud of would probably be... I'm not actually sure. Is there anything you regret? Oh, all sorts of stuff, but I'm working on that. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't masturbate so much. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Okay, I think I've lost everything I knew so far. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye, Ellie. Okay. What a hoot.",

         "Okay. I'm good. I'm a little tired.\nWhere are you from originally? I live in Culver City. Originally, I grew up in Venice.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? The beach, fast drivers, the city. I've lived in Utah. I don't really like anything else about the city.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know many people who live here anymore. Traffic. It's too big. But it's home.\nDo you travel a lot? I've been out of the country a few times.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing new places.\nWhen I was 14, I went to Costa Rica to visit my father. And I was there for two weeks. That was the last time I'd been there.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? In Costa Rica.\nSeeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker.\nHow did you feel in that moment? Joy. I was happy, excited, kind of scared.\nWhat made you decide to do that? It wasn't my decision. It was my mom's. She'd planned the trip.\nAre you happy you did that? Yeah.\nWhat did you study at school? I wanted to be an art major, but I didn't understand why. I was in math classes, among other classes. And I thought I was wasting my time, so I decided I really didn't want to do that. So I moved back to LA.\nWhat's your dream job? I don't really have a dream job. I would like to be self-employed, though.\nCan you tell me about that? Right now I'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer, but I'm not really sure.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Around new people, I'm very reserved with the people I do know. I'm a lot more outgoing and talkative. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.\nWhat do you do to relax? I go on walks. I walk my dog a lot. I call my girlfriend if I want to calm down. I also do meditation and self-hypnosis. I try.\nHow hard is that? It depends on how I'm feeling or how upset I am or how calm I'm trying to be.\nCan you tell me about that? If I'm really upset, it's a lot harder for me to calm down and bring myself down through meditation or through self-hypnosis.\nHow are you at controlling your temper? I'm alright at it. Sometimes I lose it. I yell when I lose my temper and I have put holes in walls.\nHas that gotten you in trouble? Not yet.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night, me and my mom got in an argument.\nHow do you cope with them? I don't know. I just lay in bed until I finally fall asleep in the early morning.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? I understand.\nHow have you been feeling lately? I've been alright this weekend. It has been better than most. My girlfriend has stayed at my place the entire weekend. I've been happy.\nWhat? I see what you mean.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy. That's so good to hear.\nThanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.",
         "Okay, so lately I've been feeling alright, especially this weekend since my girlfriend stayed over. That's made me really happy. But when I'm not doing well, like when I argue with my mom, I just end up lying in bed until I can finally fall asleep in the early morning. It's hard for me to calm down when I'm really upset, which makes meditation and self-hypnosis difficult. Sometimes I lose my temper and yell, and I've even put holes in walls before. To relax, I usually go on walks with my dog, call my girlfriend, or try to meditate, but it really depends on how I'm feeling at the time.",

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the arts. I like the weather. I like the people. Mm-hmm. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's expensive. It's smoggy. There's a lot of traffic. I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. Why? Well, I like where I live. I don't like to leave my familiar surroundings. That makes sense. What did you study at school? Uh, I didn't. I didn't study anything. What's your dream job? Enough to make enough money to survive. That would be a dream job. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Somewhere in the middle. Maybe shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I just try and meditate. How hard is that? It's not easy. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Not real good at it, but I don't get angry too often. Has that gotten you in trouble? Actually, I think it has, yes. Can you tell me about that? Work situations where you get angry with another employee and you should be more cool and calm. I see. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Oh, several days ago. It was about somebody's excessive drinking and money. Not my drinking. Frustrated. Person wasn't able to listen very easily. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, stuff that were dating back 20 years ago, things in my marriage, maybe arguing or being difficult. Could you have done anything to avoid it? Sure. I could have been more mindful in certain situations. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. One of them was whether or not I should get married when I was much younger. What made you decide to do that? I didn't want to disappoint my girlfriend. She wanted to get married so I didn't want to hurt her feelings. Are you happy you did that? Yes. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Instances where I wasn't an attentive father. You always want to be the best you can. I'm very hard on myself. I think back in every situation where I don't think I handled myself properly. I understand. Tell me about your kids. I have a 27-year-old son who just got married last month and he's doing very well. He's happy and adjusted. My daughter is 21 and she's in school. She is doing very well also so my kids come out very well. I'm very lucky that they are such good kids. That's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Being consistent. Keeping your emotions in check. What's the best thing about being a parent? Unconditional love from your kids. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? My parents were abusive and they threw me out. I didn't live with them. I lived in a foster home. I'm not like that. I don't hit my kids. I didn't hit my kids. I still don't hit them. I think I'm a better parent. How close are you to your family? I'm close with my son. My daughter not so close but somewhat. That's my entire family, my two kids. I have a sister too so I'm not very close with her. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Certain therapists I've had. Can you tell me about that? They just help me with being mindful, with being less hard on myself. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's difficult. Why? I can't fall asleep and when I do I wake up a lot. After an hour or two. Are you ever really triggered by something? Stress maybe. Maybe just old age. I'm not sure. I looked it up on the internet. It says old people don't really sleep very well once you reach my age. What are you like when you just eat well? I don't know. I feel, I don't feel right. I'm tired, depressed, not well rested. How have you been feeling lately? I've been very anxious and stressed out, somewhat sad. More than somewhat. I've been sad lately. I'm sorry. Can you tell me about that? I'm not working right now. I have a lot of pressures. Things don't seem to be going right. I'm getting a lot of bad news. Things aren't going my way sometimes. Always. Lately. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Yeah, I agree. Have you ever been diagnosed with food testing? No, I haven't. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Depression or sadness, I would say yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I don't know if it's a diagnosis. 30 years ago? 35 years ago? What got you to seek help? Wanting to improve my life. Wanting to be the best person I can be. Wanting to be happy. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Sometimes. It's mostly, I don't know. I don't know if it's useful or not. Sometimes I think it is. Sometimes I think it isn't. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Not much. Very little changes. I'm not sure I've been in therapy for a long time, so I don't... It's been a long time, so I don't know what changes I can attribute to therapy or to myself. I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last month at my son's wedding I was happy. Tell me more about that. Well, just seeing my son happy and doing well and successful and knowing that he turned out to be a better person than me. How would your best friend describe you? I don't have a best friend. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm kind, I'm compassionate, I'm loyal. Funny. I can be articulate. I can't think of anything else right now. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? More content, happier. I need to give myself a break sometimes. I'm very hard on myself. I would like to be easier on myself, not beat myself up so much. When was the last time that happened? Happens every day. Can you give me an example of that? If just every... I registered my car. It cost me a lot of money to register it. And then it didn't smog. I can't smog it. I put it off too long. I procrastinate too much. I should have kept my job. I need to find a new job. Just I'm rambling on. How about yourself? Learn a trade. Go to school. Realizing that I will, the future will come. And it's here. And I'm unprepared. I did my... I prepared my kids though. Maybe movie or theater. I ride my bike. I drink coffee at Starbucks. I like theater and I go to the opera. Conversation with people maybe. What about you? My children. Okay, you're welcome. Should I buzz the buzzer? Okay. What's your name? See if I can ask her name. What's it? Ellie. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording now.",
         "Okay, here's my story about dealing with depression:\n\nI think I've been dealing with depression, or at least intense sadness, for a long time, maybe 30 or 35 years. It's not a formal diagnosis, but I know the feeling well. I initially sought help because I wanted to improve my life, be the best version of myself, and ultimately, be happy. I've been in therapy on and off, but honestly, I'm not sure how much it's helped. I haven't noticed significant changes that I can directly attribute to therapy, and it's hard to separate its impact from just the passage of time.\n\nLately, I've been feeling particularly anxious, stressed, and sad. I'm currently unemployed, which is putting a lot of pressure on me, and it feels like things just aren't going my way. I have trouble sleeping; I can't fall asleep easily and wake up often. I’m very hard on myself and beat myself up about things every day. For example, I procrastinated on getting my car smogged, and now it's going to cost me a lot of money to fix. I also regret not keeping my last job. I wish I could be more content and happier, and give myself a break more often. The last time I felt truly happy was at my son's wedding last month. Seeing him happy, successful, and a better person than me made me really proud.",

         "All right, cool. I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. Are you okay with this? Mm-hmm.\nSo, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. What about you? I'm good. I'm great. Thanks.\nWhere are you from originally? Los Angeles, but I currently reside in Inglewood.\nWait, did I answer your question? Yeah.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? LA? The murals, the ocean, what else? The people. My family's over here, so that's the best part.\nWhat are some things you like about LA? I would say the smog. Yeah, the air. It could be cleaner. And yeah. I mean, there's good people and bad people, too. But yeah, for the most part, it's all good.\nDo you travel a lot? Yeah. I've been to Mexico and the temples and Northern California, so yes.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling? Traveling? Like, cleaner air. That's good. It's healthy for the body. Cleaner blood flow. The people, culture, and stories. And when you come back, you can share stories with your friends.\nI'd love to hear about one of your trips. Okay, so this one time when I was a kid, we went out to the temples and it started raining. So we just started walking through and when we get to the top, one thing I didn't know before is that the higher you go, the smaller the steps get. So people back then had smaller feet. So what happened was as I went higher towards the temple, I had to walk sideways so my feet could measure up to the steps. But once you get up there, it's a nice view.\nAwesome. What did you study at school? General education, but mainly art. Yeah. I took a lot of art classes.\nWhat made you decide to do that? Well, when I was a kid, I used to scribble on walls with Crayola so I figured it kind of stuck around with me so I just pursued it.\nWhat's your dream job? My dream job would be to get paid for painting. Painting art. Yeah.\nHow hard is painting? It's not so much that it's hard. It just requires passion, persistence, and faith and will. You just have to really believe in yourself. The more you believe in yourself, the more likely you are able to succeed.\nDo you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I consider myself to be shy in certain time and places, but I am also outgoing when I have the energy. So I feel like it's well balanced. I'm shy when it's okay to be shy. And I'm outgoing when the need to actually have fun or just explore feels good, if that makes sense.\nWhat do you do to relax? To relax? I don't know if I should say this, but I smoke weed. So that helps. I like painting. Painting helps me relax. Especially when I use a color blue, because a color blue relaxes me. And also green. When I use these two colors and make a painting, it calms me down.\nYou have a blue shirt. My temper? Well, my thoughts control my emotions. That's pretty much how my tempering. I try to make sense. Is it worth getting mad? Or if I do get mad, what would be the outcome? So controlling my temper is just training my thought.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? The last time I argued with somebody was with my father. It was because I wanted to eat food, but he wanted me to buy wine. So right when the food was ready, I was hungry to eat, and he was like, nope. So that kind of frustrated me. The way I handled it was like, well, I could just eat when I come back. I'm doing him a favor. And then after, I could just eat in peace.\nTell me about your relationship with your family. My family? It's pretty good. My mom and dad have a good relationship. We're still married. And my brothers and sisters, we help one another out. So that's good. It's just like a team.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. A situation I wish I could handle differently would be... that's a good question. I mean, can I get a scenario? Whatever comes to mind. Okay. Situation... Well, see, that's the thing. I feel like if I'm calm in any situation, I can figure it out. But if it came down to a Rubik's Cube, maybe, how would I handle that situation would be just by failing, making mistakes. Because if I make the right mistakes, the right lessons will come after. So that's the best way I could answer your question.\nTell me about an event or something you wish you could erase from your life. I've had some pretty bad experiences with being at gunpoint and with a knife. But at the end of the day, what that did was give me more insight. It made me more aware. And it taught me how to read people a little bit more, like to sense things out and also how to avoid situations. So even though it was bad and it did kind of scar me, it did prepare me for the world. Because this happened to me when I was 12, 13 years old. So I was already being exposed to guns, knives and all that stuff. It's bad, but it's good in the long term. Because if you get out of that slump, nothing else would really phase you. Because you think in your head, I've been through worse. So it's not as bad.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever made to make. This one right now. The moment I got stuck, I was trying to think. That was part of it. But the hardest decision as far as life changing? Life changing. Whether to continue school, college or not. I kind of chose to pursue my own. I'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field I want to be in. So that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that I would run into the right people. But I took that chance and I met the right people.\nAre you happy with that? That's good.\nHow easy is it for you to get back to sleep? It's actually really easy. If I wanted to, I could sleep right now in 10 minutes. I could just shut down my mind and slow down my air pattern.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Lately, I've been feeling good. I've been feeling like I have free will. At this point in time, I feel like if I chose a path, any path with my heart, I could get there. But I'm still deciding. All these paths are in the air. Or should I make my own? I don't know. That's where I'm at. I feel like I have free will.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Lately? Like in the past two weeks or today? Whatever comes to mind. Okay. Yeah, things happen that would change my feelings. For example, right now, it just happened. For right now, this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought. Because it's technology. It's a trip to see how far one could take a thought and make it reality. So that's kind of shifting my thoughts right now. This whole experience.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with a stress disorder? Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? No.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Depression? I know how it's like to be depressed, but diagnosed by a doctor? No.\nCan you tell me about that? Depression? How it feels? How does depression feel like? It feels like it's like a bird in a cage. Being depression is like being a fish who can't swim in the water. Feeling depression is like being a bird without wings. Pretty much, it feels like you're limited. But then the thing is, to get out of that depression, it's like you have to awaken and change your perspective. And focus on, I would say colors. Colors help. And people. Talking to people helps.\nWhen was the last time you were depressed? Being depressed? Let's see. I don't know. It could happen every day. It's small doses. I could tell you today, earlier, when I was just by myself, I felt a little depressed. But then what happened, I fixed it. I called up a friend and met up with him.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy. At this moment, I feel pretty happy. I'm talking to a virtual person. It's pretty cool. Right now, I feel happy.\nHow would you describe yourself? Sometimes hard-headed. He would try to teach me a certain lesson, whether it's art or just in my character. He would probably just describe me as like, he would listen, but at the same time, he would still do what he wants to do. So pretty much like, I don't know. That's what he tells me. Overall, a good person.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Probably just exercise. My diet, food, my food intake. Just exercise. Pretty much it.\nTell me about that. What it would be was, it would either be about my art. If I did something and I thought it was good, then someone else would be like, that looks kind of like trash. Then I would be like, oh damn. Either I could accept it and be like, yeah, it does kind of look and then fix it. Or what I would do back then would be like, damn, just kind of dwell on that thought. And then just stay there for a bit and then eventually I'll come out of it. But yeah, usually it's about people's words and ideas.\nIs there anything you regret? Regret? Yeah, I've got a couple of things I regret.\nLike what? Well, sometimes I feel like I should have completed the whole university thing. But I mean, at the same time, I feel like if I really wanted to go, I would have gone. So yeah, that's kind of a regret in my head.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago would be seek spiritual well-being. Learn how to handle your thoughts. Choose your thoughts. I would teach myself. Pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment. Sort of advance your experience and as far as your overall happiness.\nWhat are you most proud of right now? Well, I'm most proud of right now is my paintings. Yeah, I'm proud of that because like I feel like these paintings I'm releasing are things that no one else could duplicate. You know, it's like it's one of a kind and like it's there, you know, it has its own signature. So yeah, I'm pretty happy about that.\nOkay. Thank you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye.",
         "Okay, so when it comes to depression, I haven't been officially diagnosed, but I definitely know what it feels like. To me, depression is like being a bird in a cage, or a fish that can't swim. It's a feeling of being limited. To get out of it, I have to change my perspective. Focusing on colors really helps, and so does talking to people. It's not like I'm constantly depressed, but it can happen in small doses, even daily. Earlier today, I felt a little down when I was alone, but I fixed it by calling a friend.",

         "Okay. You're welcome. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are clearly confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm okay.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nLA.\nReally? What are some things you really like about LA?\nThere's a lot of variety. There's a lot of health oriented stuff. There's all kinds of food to eat. You can go to the desert. You can go anywhere. I mean there's a lot. And the weather's great.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic. Lately the change in weather. It's kind of a little too unpredictable. But mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nI wouldn't say a lot. Just occasionally.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nIt's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe I wouldn't normally do. Different people. Learning about different people. Different customs. It depends. I mean if it's water, real pretty water. Being in beautiful water. Relaxing. Adventure. I love adventure.\nI'd love to hear about your trips.\nSome time ago I went to Cayman Islands and went on...I get seasick but my sister gave me some medication. I went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and I accidentally got back on the wrong boat. Yeah and they were really crazy. They made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat. And I thought I was going to drown because the water was kind of rough. I was really shocked that they wanted me to do that.\nOh no.\nYeah but I survived.\nThat's good.\nYeah pretty good. What did you study at school?\nBusiness management. But also hypnotherapy.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nWell I came from a serious kind of family so that just seems something that would be universal. That would cover a lot of different subjects.\nAre you happy with your choice?\nYes. Yeah. But yes and no. I mean now I kind of wish it was something different.\nLike what?\nI like communication. I love speaking and interviewing strangers. I'm very outgoing and funny. So probably would have been something more like either liberal arts, communication, that type of thing.\nThat makes sense. What's your dream job?\nDream job would just be out there, you know, like some of these people maybe on TV exploring different places and getting paid for it. And always like a fun adventure, interacting with people, doing things I haven't done before. And helping people, you know, in some way with what I do so that they can see that I'm uncoordinated in some ways. And you know, they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver.\nHey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI watch TV. I go work out. I go walking. I recently got like a bike that I kind of sort of fixed up. Go do something new. Go to a festival. Go grocery shopping. Interact with friends. Call them. See them. That type of thing.\nTalk to strangers.\nDepends on the situation. There's a bunch of times I'm good at it. If it has to do with like traffic and cars, it's a little more intense for me. It's a little tougher. Or people who are like really rude, you know, with the way they cut you off.\nLuckily not. You know, I'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes where if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot, I'll confront them on that sometimes.\nMight have been with my sister. I'm not sure of the topic, but whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got it in an argument. It sounds childish about who was right, you know, because she thinks she's always the smarter one because she's older. How do you feel about your mom?\nYeah.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nI'm real close to I see my parents almost every weekend. More close to my mother. I have a twin sister. I stay in touch with her even though she's out of town. She lives out of town and I've got two other sisters, so I stay in touch with all of them. You know, it's a mixed bag. You know, we kind of have a sort of aggressiveness in us a little bit. But also. Well, me. And ever. I mean, strangers, sometimes my family, you know, they've done nice things for me. Strangers have been very sometimes unexpectedly very nice. I could be shopping and, you know, maybe I can't reach something and some guy will pop up behind me and, you know, without me saying anything, just help me out. That type of thing. Or if somebody's like kind of mean to me, somebody will like commiserate, you know, and. I had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me because he thought I didn't like his dog. It was, you know, I'm not crazy about dogs, but he kind of flipped out for me. And I was like, you know, I'm not crazy about dogs. I wish I had confronted that back then because I, you know, but it create a lot of anxiety for me because I feel like I could have nipped it in the bud instead of having to deal with the major stress from it. Now he and I don't talk at all. I just feel it's best. He's kind of odd.\nSometimes breaking up with somebody or. Yeah, usually or getting rid of a friend. That type of thing. Sometimes I feel guilty about some of my past behavior with people. Or maybe I wasn't as understanding. When I was younger, I stole things, you know, that's not the best behavior. And it's stuff like that.\nTell me about that or something that you worshiped or erased from your memory.\nOh God, there's a lot of them. I wish I could erase, you know, how tough my dad was on us as children. And erase a lot of memories of men I dated that just didn't work out well at all. And, um. Yeah.\nI can drop off like right away.\nYeah. Cranky. Irritated. Snarky. A bit out of sorts. I've had some anxiety with money and relationships because I haven't been in one for so long. Meal. Just a lot of anxiety.\nTake a deep breath. Try and do positive things. You know, sometimes. Eat healthier, workout more. Talk to my friend about it. That type of thing. I know I'm not that kind of person.\nTry and look for interesting activities to do. To distract me. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with insomnia?\nWell, not officially. But I know, you know, from things I've experienced that I've had. I've, you know, I get very anxious in certain situations.\nAre you triggered by something?\nYeah. It's usually triggered by, um. Sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy, it triggers a lot of anxiety in me. If they're aggressive. Whether it be physically or verbally. Or sometimes if they're too much in my space. You know, where I am. It bothers me.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nYeah. A long time ago.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nIt was ages ago. Maybe over ten years ago. Fifteen years ago.\nHow old were you when you died?\nUm. I was depressed. I mean, I know that's nothing to laugh about. But I mean, it's kind of in a circle. Just to, um. I wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more.\nWhat were your symptoms?\nFeeling stuck in certain thoughts. Having a lot of negative thoughts. Feeling of hopelessness, helplessness. That type of thing.\nWhat? Still have a therapy now?\nUm. I go occasionally. It's a different type. I'll go see a hypnotherapist. Sometimes to release anxiety that's in me.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful?\nYes, I do. Very useful.\nWhat sort of changes have you noticed since you've been doing therapy?\nA lot more awareness of myself and other people. Learning more control, more confidence. Better self-esteem. Willing to try even more things. You know, whether I know the outcome or not. You know, of the unknown. I'll experiment a lot more.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nWhat was the most difficult thing you've ever done?\nHelping like at the 25th mile, handing out water. And there were some people there who were doing that for the first time. Also, some event at my sister's where there were just a couple of us. And I was cracking a lot of jokes. Sometimes I'm like really funny. You know, and I can't even believe myself. You know, I just go on and on. You know, and everyone starts laughing. I'm not even trying to. And I'm just saying like regular stories. And people look at me funny and laugh.\nYeah. That. How are your best friends by the way?\nAs a really decent, loyal, empathetic. Deserving. Supportive. I'm hoping. Outgoing. Quirky. Type of person.\nUh huh. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nWell, it would be great to look even younger. Uh, or be younger. If that was humanly possible. Be even more patient with people. I think, um, you know, not get frustrated. Like if I think somebody's not very smart. Sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nWhoa. Wow. Make a lot of money and plan for your future. And try and be as kind and patient with people as possible. And have a lot of fun. Try new things.\nUh huh. What are you most proud of in your life?\nI think of my mind and my perseverance that, um, I've changed a lot of things within my personality. I feel proud of volunteer work. I feel proud. I've helped a bunch of people lose weight, declutter their homes. I've helped create a lot of positive change in people.\nThat's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to.\nOh, okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYeah, it was nice talking to you. Goodbye.\nBye.\nShe nods her head a lot. Ha! What's it going to end? I'm going to stop here. Okay.",
         "Okay, so I was diagnosed with depression a long time ago, probably over fifteen years ago. Back then, I experienced feeling stuck in my thoughts, lots of negative thoughts, and a general sense of hopelessness and helplessness. I still see a hypnotherapist occasionally to release anxiety. I find therapy really useful. Since starting, I've become much more aware of myself and others, gained more control and confidence, and improved my self-esteem. I'm also more willing to try new things, even the unknown. These days, I get triggered by people who are really angry or aggressive, either physically or verbally, and when people get too much in my personal space. To cope, I try to do positive things like eating healthier, working out, and talking to friends. I also look for interesting activities to distract me.",

         "Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing well, thank you.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nLos Angeles.\nReally? What are some things you really like about LA?\nSports, outdoor sports mainly.\nLike what?\nSurfing, snowboarding, mountain biking, rock climbing.\nAwesome. What are some things you don't really like about LA?\nTraffic.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nYes.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nExperiencing different cultures.\nI'd love to hear about one of your trips.\nWell, I love going to Mexico. And it's so much different from California and Western culture, so to speak. I know Mexico is a Western civilization, but the level of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that they're like two different worlds.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nTraveling, you mean?\nYeah.\nI would have to say going to an island off the coast of Fiji. Fiji, the name is Tabaruwa, and it's a very small island. You can walk around it in 30 or 40 minutes. And it's a place where you go to go surfing. And it is an incredible, visually incredible and experientially incredible place.\nNice. What did you study at school?\nI studied biology.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nI was pushed from behind by my father, who was a medical doctor, and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also.\nAre you still working in that?\nNot at all. I'm working in areas of business now.\nAre you happy you did that?\nYes, I am.\nWhat's your dream job?\nMy dream job would be to be a missionary.\nReally?\nYes.\nCan you tell me about that?\nMy father's initial objective when he became an M.D. was to become a missionary, and he's a very generous person, and I think I am too. I got that from him herititarily. But I would like to help people, and I don't think being a doctor is helping people. I really don't. I think it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket. I would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources, things like that, if I could afford to travel to remote places like that.\nYeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI exercise.\nOkay. How are you at controlling your temper?\nI think I'm pretty good at it. I think I'm pretty effective at it.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nIt was probably two days ago. It was my girlfriend, and it was about her lack of consideration.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nUm, I felt frustrated.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nA situation which I wished I could handle differently. In my later years, I would say I don't have many regrets. In my younger years, I used to be snubbed by people, and I would keep my mouth shut, and I wouldn't say anything. I would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior. I would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings. I've learned that that is so wrong. And so in probably the last 15 to 20 years, I have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away, and that takes care of the anger immediately.\nHas that gotten you in trouble?\nYes. It depends what you mean by trouble. I think all the way around, once you take the beginning to the end, it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble.\nThat makes sense. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nGoing back, it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted. We argued at length for many months and years about this, and finally I prevailed, and I didn't go that route. But that was probably the most difficult period in my life.\nI see. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nThere was a time when I wished I could erase female interactions, girlfriends and their betrayals. But now I realize that keeping those memories make me who I am today, and dealing with them defines who I am today.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nMy parents are deceased. I had very good relationships with my parents. I'm very thankful for that. Even though my father was somewhat of a hard-handed draconian person, we came to an understanding well before he died. My brothers, I get along great with my younger brother, but my older brother has issues. He has psychological issues, and they continue to plague him and to affect me also, just knowing that he's going through turmoil.\nI'm sorry. How do you cope with them?\nWell, I guess I really don't cope with it because he's clinically depressed, and he has suicidal tendencies, and he's not working. He's very highly educated, and he doesn't talk to me, and his family is very abusive towards him. It's not a happy relationship for his family.\nThat sounds really hard.\nYes.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nI would have to say my father. My father is my hero. He's my model. He's my archetype for what a man should be.\nI understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nOh, I was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking. I always experience joy when I'm exercising at a very high level of exertion.\nThat's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you?\nFunny, jovial, intelligent, perfectionist.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nMaybe to submerge my hedonistic self.\nCan you tell me about that?\nI look at, once again, my father fills my consciousness. He was the ultimate deferrer of gratification. He put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that. And that's what made him the self-made man that he was.\nTell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself.\nMy last day of work when he fired me, he started using a lot of profanity toward me. I turned to him and I said, you cannot talk to me that way. He continued to use more profanity until I objected to it again and that's when he fired me. That's still in my mind and that occurred a year and a half ago.\nWow. Is there anything you regret?\nAnything I regret? Oh yeah, I regret not getting married and having kids.\nCould you have done anything to avoid it?\nSure, I suppose I could. But I think that would have robbed me of the many opportunities I had and I took to travel around the world and experience different cultures. Because that's what I enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness. Because the United States is not the end of the world. Once you get to travel you find out that we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world. Other people think that we're the only ones that think that and I disagree.\nI see what you mean. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nThat's a good one. I would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and I think I've done that. And I may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer. So I think I'm happy with my life thus far.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nI was giving a rock climbing lesson. I have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing. And many of these people have never done it before. And they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives. So that was very gratifying to me.\nThat's great. What are you most proud of in your life?\nI would say my devotion to the environment. I wasn't always an environmentalist. I have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment. Because today there are a lot of people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that. And I stand up and I have been on TV and on YouTube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment.\nOkay. I think I've announced everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're welcome. Goodbye.\nGoodbye. That was interesting.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are incredibly confidential. Are they true?\nI was born in Hawaii, but I grew up in Colorado.\nReally?\nYeah.\nWhen did you move to LA?\nAbout seven to eight years ago.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI try to go back once or twice a year.\nHow does it compare to LA?\nIt's different. It's not as busy. There's more things to do outdoors in the mountains.\nHow long have you been in LA? For work.\nAre you happy to do that?\nYeah, I am. I love it here.\nHow easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?\nIt took about a year before I really felt comfortable, but once I got through that kind of hard year, it was pretty good out here. I had a good time.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nI think it's the traffic.\nDo you travel a lot?\nWhat do you do to relax?\nHow are you at controlling your hunger?\nThat's good.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nHow did you get into a situation that you wish you would handle differently?\nI don't know if there is one. I mean, I'm sure there is, but... One time I was driving behind someone, and they cut me off. And I think it had just been one of those days. This was like a year ago or two years ago. It was just one of those days where I just didn't want... Or it had been a frustrating day. And when this person cut me off and I almost got in an accident with them, I just followed them to their parking spot. And actually I had honked at them, and they flipped me off. And so it just really got into my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then flip me off. So I followed them to the spot, and I asked, I said, Miss, why did you flip me off when you cut me off? And she said, Oh, you know, I've had a rough day. I don't need your attitude. And her daughter was with her, and I told her, Well, you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter. And, you know, I didn't need to be petty like that, but I just... I wanted to be, I guess.\nUm, I guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom, telling her I was gay. I mean, it wasn't hard because it was the right one, but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she had trouble accepting it. And it took a while, but once she did, you know, everything was better. And I knew it would be, but it was just hard in the moment to, you know, tell her something she didn't want to hear.\nHow did that move on, or something that you wish you could erase from your memory?\nUm... When I was a little kid, my grandfather found our dog run over on the road, and he, uh... and brought it in. And I remember as a kid just, like, seeing death like that really just threw me off. It just threw me off and frightened me. It was just one of those moments that I guess I wish I hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed. She was just so sad. And it was just one of those moments I guess you need as a kid, but I didn't really want to experience loss like that in your face.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nMy relationship with my family is pretty good. We're probably not as close as most, but we, you know, we always... we don't talk often, but we talk with love, and we always love each other when we see each other.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nUm... My grandmother was very positive. She was always very encouraging and told me to, you know, pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down. So I'm glad I had her.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nUsually it's easy. Sometimes it's not.\nCan you tell me about that?\nWell, I've been between jobs recently. I start a new job next week. But while I've been off, while I haven't been working, I tend to like...my body wants to stay up later and later and later, and I'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven. So I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty, and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half when I should be... I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine, but I just don't want to stay up, I guess.\nWhat's the most important thing about being a job?\nUh, I'm a little scatterbrained. Today I'm a little scatterbrained because I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning and... so, scatterbrained.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nWell, since I've had a lot of time on my hands, like I don't usually have this much time on my hands, so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working, I guess.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?\nUm, I just thought maybe I'm a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the not working thing.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nMm-mm.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nUm, a couple days ago when I got my new job. When I got hired.\nHow would your best friend describe you?\nUm... outgoing, listening, attentive, um... fun, loyal. Uh-huh. I think. I hope.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nUm, I wish that I... I probably wish that I looked better. I wish I had more hair up here, losing it a little bit. I probably wish I was a little skinnier. This girdle's pretty tight. And, um, you know, sometimes I wish I had more money, but nothing too drastic. I'm okay.\nTell me about a time when someone made you feel really proud of yourself.\nOh, um... When I was a little kid, I was the fat kid. And, um, gosh, I remember I was like going into high school, and it was like the second day. And I remember this guy came up to me and was, um... like he was like pretty nice to me, I thought. And then I didn't realize he'd... like this is like out of a movie, right? Like he had put band-aids on my back that said like, I'm a fat cow, and said like, uh, like, yeah. Like just a bunch of mean stuff. And I didn't know, and I walked around with it for like half an hour. I heard people laughing, and I didn't get it. And then finally this girl just came up to me and was like, there's like band-aids on your back that say all these mean things. And then she just walked away. She didn't like help me take them off. And I remember like I couldn't get them. I was trying to find them. And then, um, I just remember like putting my head in my locker, and like I didn't want anyone to see me cry, so I just like put my head in my locker, and like pretend like I was looking at stuff in my backpack, but really I was, you know, the crying fat kid who couldn't get the mean stickers off his back.\nIs there anything very bad? Anything?\nUm, probably.\nYeah?\nWhat advice would you give yourself in 10 or 20 years?\nUm, you know, I would try to keep, I would try to let myself know to look at things positively and to not like worry what other people think about you. I think I spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me. And as I got older, I didn't care as much, and I started enjoying life a lot more, so.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nUh, I went to Coachella. It's a music festival. It was three days with all of my friends and my boyfriend, and we danced and we went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time.\nWhat are you most proud of in life?\nOh, I guess my career, humble as it may be, I really stuck in LA a long time. When it was hard, I stuck around. I didn't quit, so, you know, I'm proud that I've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood.\nOkay, I think I've asked everything I knew to you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nMy pleasure. Goodbye.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective based on the interview:\n\nI haven't been diagnosed with depression, but lately, since I've been between jobs, I've been feeling a bit off. I have too much time on my hands, which is frustrating. I've noticed I'm more absent-minded than usual. My sleep schedule has also been disrupted; I find myself wanting to stay up later and later, and I struggle to fall asleep at a reasonable time. I also mentioned a childhood memory that was difficult: seeing my grandfather bring our dog home after it had been run over. It was a very sad moment and frightened me. Finally, I mentioned a moment in high school when I was made fun of for my weight.",

         "Okay. Beep, beep. So just a reminder, after she says goodbye, press this button and I'll come back over. Alright. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist. But I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah, sure. So, how are you doing today? I'm alright. I'm in a weird test study right now. Where are you from originally? I'm from Los Angeles. Really? Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? All kinds of different things to do in the city. Like what? Uh, well, I don't know. Each area is a little different and it's hard to get boring around here. Mm-hmm. What are some things you don't really like about LA? You know, the traffic and the smog and all that. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I'd like to. Why? Money, mainly. Lack of money. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like seeing the world and seeing all the different places. And what do you do for all your trips? I went to Russia three years ago. Nice. What's the most memorable experience? I like to go into the churches. We did a huge trip of all the churches in the area. That's great. What did you study at school? Music, for the most part. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I've been playing music for a long time. Are you still working on that? Yeah. What's your dream job? Musician. Touring, performing musician. How hard is that? Really, really hard. Why? A lot of competition and luck involved. That sucks. I agree. Do you consider yourself more shy or a pillion? Little of both, I suppose. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Again, probably just I play a lot of music. Sit down with a guitar for a little while. That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? I would say good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I'm having difficulty thinking of one on the spot right now. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make. I'm not sure. I can't think of anything. What's something you feel guilty about? Guilty? When I was a boy, I stole a little golden bicycle from an old lady. I'm not proud of it. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's not ideal. I live with my parents. I'm 23 years old. That's becoming more and more awkward. I understand. Can you tell me about that? I don't know. I think things are improving. I need to move out. I need to get my own apartment and then we can come back around and be friends, I'm sure, with my parents. Yeah. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. There's a lot of positive influences in my life. I've got a good group of friends, my family. I love them nonetheless. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Easy, I would say. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Not as groggy as some people get. How have you been feeling lately? Just in general. Well, I'd say. Things are all right. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, nothing huge. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I had a really good band practice last night with all the friends. I felt really good about that. Awesome. How are your best friends around you? I think generally funny and good to be around. What are some things you like about yourself? What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Work ethic, I think is a big one. Can you tell me about that? Sure. I have a lot of projects that I've planned for myself in my life, and I have difficulty completing them. Why? I like to use space as an excuse. That's my go-to one. I don't have a good studio to record music. I see. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bothered about yourself. Um. Well, okay. This current band that I'm working with. I was told, I'm a part-time member in this band, and I was told that I wasn't officially in the core group and stuff. I felt pretty bad about that for a few days. I'm sorry. It's all right. Is there anything you regret? Um. In life. Mm-hmm. Maybe going, maybe finishing college. That might be something. Why did you decide to do that? Um. I don't know. I just never came to pass that I would transfer to a four-year university and get a bachelor's degree. What would you say are some of the best qualities? Best qualities? I think generally that easygoingness and good sense of humor. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I did recently that I really enjoyed. Last weekend, I went camping on a beach with a bunch of friends. That was nice. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of, I guess, you know, musical accomplishments. I put a lot of work into that, and I'm finding success in my way. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thank you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. That was interesting. Goodbye. Hit this button. Very interesting. I'm going to stop the recording and you can take that.",
         "Okay, so regarding my experience with depression, I haven't been diagnosed with it. However, there are definitely things that bother me. For instance, I felt pretty bad when I learned I wasn't considered a core member of the band I'm working with; that feeling lingered for a few days. I also struggle with my work ethic. I have a lot of projects planned, particularly related to my music, but I have difficulty completing them. I often use the lack of a good studio as an excuse. Overall though, things are alright.",

         "Okay, sure. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. So, I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? Oh, San Fernando Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I really like the culture. I love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really. I like to go camping, but I don't really travel. When was the last time that happened? I think it might have been around six months ago. I went on a trip with a geology class. Nice. Yeah, it was fun. It's been a memorable experience. What's your dream job? Huh. I don't know, but I really like children and I really like studying their behavior. So I think something along those lines might be it. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm generally pretty outgoing. I tend to be shy around my family, but when I'm around friends and stuff, I think I'm pretty friendly. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with someone, I was probably with my boyfriend. How did you feel about that moment? I'm not really taking my feelings into consideration and I really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because I just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out. I see. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I think a lot of times when my oldest little brother does something wrong, I tend to be harsh with him. We're not as close as my sister and I or my youngest brother and I. And so he tends to be hostile back. And I think that if I were a little bit more gentle, it might be easier to communicate with him. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. When I was 19, I came home from a party, I think around 4 a.m. on a Sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of very nice things. And then he didn't speak to me for about a year. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that I don't live at home. I used to be really frustrated with her all the time because she has a really quick temper. But I think now that I've got a little bit more distance, I can see that she did the best that she could. And I love my siblings. I again, my little sister and I get along really well. She's four years younger than me. And when when she was around 12, when I was around 16, it was really difficult because she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody. And I wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff. So we fought all the time, but we don't anymore. And that's really great. And. We get along OK with my my older little brother, who's 15, and I think I got along pretty well with my youngest brother, who's 12. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? One of the first, not the first, but one of my first philosophy professors. And I really loved her classes and it was really good being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people. That was really motivating since not all my classes were like that. Great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I think it's pretty easy. I mean, sometimes I'll have trouble going to sleep, but generally it's not that bad. I think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, well, I'm really tired. I can get grumpy, but I think usually I'm just groggy. OK. How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good. I'm a little anxious about, um. About getting a job and I'm going to be taking summer school, but it's only one class, so I'll have a lot of free time. Yeah. How do you cope with them? Well, I mean, it's not the end of the world if I don't get a job, but I know that I will eventually. So mostly I think I just try not to think about it too much and I try not to be pessimistic. OK. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Well, I think the last time I felt really happy, I went to a party with my boyfriend at the end of the department party. And I was, you know, I knew a couple of people there, so I felt comfortable, but I was able to meet new people. And there were a couple of kids there, I spent time in the pool and had a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun. That's great. How would your best friend describe you? She would probably say that I'm smart and pretty intellectual. I love to read and to watch really like serious films and TV. And she would probably also say that I'm fun because we like to go out and have fun a lot. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes. So that's a major one, that I'm procrastinating. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. I got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was given 60 some hours of community service. And of course I procrastinated on doing that, so I had to show up to court again to get an extension. And the judge was very mean and he yelled at me, but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought. It seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at. So I understand because that's his job, but it was not great for me because I was really anxious in that situation. That sucks. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, I would have been 12 and 2. But I think I would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents because I think I was a little selfish and self-involved back then. Is there anything you regret? I can't really think of anything. I mean, I regret how I treated my mother when I was a kid, but everyone does that. I do regret a couple of semesters ago I didn't do so well in school and I got a few W's, which I now have to work to get off on my transcript. Do you have done anything to avoid it? I think so. I think I wasn't focusing on school at that time and I didn't see any counselors at school or anything, so I definitely could have done that. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Hmm. I think I probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping on Saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges. And then maybe going out to breakfast Sunday and just like window shopping. What was the most proud thing in your life? I think I was proud of how he turned out and how close we are. That's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.",
         "Okay, so I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I do experience anxiety, especially about getting a job right now. I try to cope by not thinking about it too much and avoiding pessimistic thoughts. I also regret not focusing on school a couple of semesters ago, which led to some academic setbacks. I wish I had sought counseling during that time. There have been periods where I haven’t been as kind to myself as I should be. Overall, though, I'm feeling pretty good lately.",

The beach and the weather.\nWhat are some things you like about LA?\nOh the traffic and the people in this Hollywood scene. Hollywood type image. Not as much as I used to, but I've been to Europe. I went on a cruise, several cruise. Been to Jamaica, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Morocco, London, Portugal, yeah. And I'm going to Hawaii in August. Meeting new people and just seeing new things and just simulating into other people's culture and customs and traditions. Oh, the best trip I ever took is when I was a student at Santa Monica College and took a, it was a Mediterranean cruise. Oh my God, that was the best time of my life. Oh God, being on that ship. I felt electrifying, fulfilled, satisfied. I felt like I can do it. And I just, I moved past the fear and just said, I'm doing this. I'm in law school and I'm going to be an attorney. I've always wanted to be an attorney and it's been a long time coming. Oh, my dream job is to have my own law firm. My husband and I living in a beach community and our friends, we know each other.

We're going to be seen and we're constantly in conflict. Oh, I get on my bike and ride my bike. Oh, it depends on what the situation is. I need to control that. Not trouble, but it made it has made people back up all for me. Oh, God, what was the last time I really had an argument?\nI don't know. It's been a while. Argument. It's been a long time that I can't even remember. Oh, God, let's see. Oh, goodness. Oh, just dealing with my siblings and my family and just trying to defuse the situation and not get so heated and just remain cool and calm and collective. Oh, when my mother passed years ago, the conflict over her belongings and all that stuff and, you know, stressful time and everybody else. Everybody's emotions kind of high and arguing back and forth. And now I'm not doing that. Distance and the I just. It's just amazing that these people, I shouldn't say these people that we grew up in the fam. We grew up in the same household. And then as we got older, you know, God takes us on different paths. It's just like, who are these people? Or did I grew up in a household with them? Why are they? And they may say the same thing about me. I don't know. I just like to have peaceful living, honey. Pardon me. Oh, God. Positive influences. Oh, college professors. Friends. Church members. People like that. Oh, God. Divorce. Should I continue with my education?\nI don't know.\ndecide to do that?\nWell with my mom, you only have one mother and when it was over said and done I just wanted to do what was right according to what God would want me to do and I didn't want to have any curses over my life of blessings because the Bible says honor thy parents, my mother and father and all thy days so you can live longer and I wanted blessings and not curses.\nTell me about your life or something that you or she could erase from your life?\nMy marriage. My marriage. Ah God that had such a negative influence on my life, such a negative impact but in all that it taught me, it made me who I am today and I have no animosity.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nOh lately it's been so difficult, the school and finals and midterms and all that is coming up.

Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo, never.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nYeah when I went through that divorce and my mother passed out I was really depressed.\nWhat were your symptoms?\nFatigue, tired, no matter what I did I couldn't get any enjoyment. Just a feeling of emptiness and loneliness and isolation and shock, trauma. It was very difficult.\nWhat got you to see the problem?\nTime, um, just time. It just took time just to process to work its way through.\nDo you still go to therapy now?\nNo, no not at all.\nWhy did you stop?\nJust got busy with life stuff.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful?\nYeah I need somebody to talk to.

They were so thankful and grateful. So thankful. And then he invited me on stage because he sings and I felt so when I got up on stage because I like to sing but I'm so shy in front of people and they're judgmental and they might look at me and I got up on that stage and I just I'm like well is this how this feels? This feels good. Oh God. Oh man. Awesome.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nOh my accomplishments. Overcoming them one by one. Setting the goal and reaching them.\nThat's great.

I'm not a therapist, but I'm really learning about people and I love learning about you. I like to think about things. Please feel free to comment on anything. The answers are really important. Are you okay with this? Yes.\nSo, Ali, what are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good. Thank you.\nWhere are you from, and what's your name? Maryland.\nReally? Yeah.\nWhen did you start? 85.\nThat's a long time. Yeah, it is.\nHow often do you go back to work? Not as often as I'd like.\nWhy? Out of work. So, you know, the money issue.\nHow does it compare to your life? Maryland is different. And so the comparison is, the only comparison is that they're both cities, but Maryland has its flavor and LA has its own flavor. So they have unique characteristics about themselves.\nWhy did you move to LA? I moved to LA because I was living in Hawaii and I was out of money and I just had enough for a plane ticket and come and stay here in a hotel until I found a job, which I did really quickly. But anyway, so that's why I came here. I didn't want to go home. I decided to come here and just start over.\nAre you happy with your job? I am. I am.\nThat's great. How easy was it for you at least early in your life? It was real easy. Just did it.\nWhat are some things you really love about LA? I like LA's weather. I like the different areas in Los Angeles County, West LA, East LA. I like Southern California, you know, period. So, you know, I like the people, but yeah, so I like the attitude, you know, the LA attitude. So yeah.\nWhat are some things you don't really love about LA? I don't like some of the policies with regard to the smoking. You know, I really wish that the government would crack down on smoking on the streets, make it like USC.\nDo you tell them a lot? No, not outside of getting on the bus and things like that.\nOkay. What did you study at school? I was studying to be a nurse.\nGood job, interesting. Yeah.\nHow did you decide to do that? I wanted to have a job that pays well, but afforded me the opportunity to use my service gift. So yeah.\nAre you still looking at that? No, I had to put that, put that on the side and I want to get a business degree now. Yeah. My dream job is, is to create new technology. Other than to say I would like to create something that would change the world like Steve Jobs with his iPhone. Yeah.\nDo you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I am, it depends on the situation, but I'm more outgoing. I do tend towards a little shyness from time to time.\nWhat do you do when you're relaxed? What I do is I'll go to the movies.\nWhen was the last time you were out there? I went to the movies probably like maybe five weeks ago. Yeah. Okay.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? Well, I had an argument recently, not really an argument, but a disagreement with a woman at my church who is over this particular department that I'm in. And it's a volunteer position. I use my administrative assistant, more executive assistant skills to, I do minutes for meetings that I cover. And so then I have to produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that. And this person is micromanaging me, but not micromanaging the other admin assistant who did not get her block of people into this particular meeting. So the meeting should have been comprised of a hundred people, but we have like maybe 30. No, it wasn't even 30, 20. Yes. So now she doesn't know that I realized that part of it. So there was a little bit of an argument and but again, not an argument, but a disagreement. And when we talk again, I will point out to the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect. There's a disconnect and the energy she's investing in me is unprofitable for what we're trying to achieve.\nDoesn't that sound good? Yeah.\nHow are you controlling your temper? It depends on, I'm very good at controlling my temper. It's, you know, there are places where you can allow your temper to come out, even though it might not be appropriate. And then there are other places where if it comes out, then you shut yourself in the foot. So I'm pretty good at controlling my temper. Yeah. I don't have any situation recent that I can think of. I would probably say just dealing with a neighbor instead of responding to the neighbor, just ignore the neighbor altogether. So I wish I'd done that differently. Yeah.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Thankfully, I've not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet. I have what I do in my life and, you know, in my going forward, you know, everything that I've done and everything that has happened, I accept it as something that has to be to get me to go forward. I am a born again Christian, and so I know that that God is sovereign over my life and also that according to his word, the Bible says that every day of our life is written in his book. So events and circumstances, I feel that I feel they are ordained by God. Now, obviously, I'm not going to jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous, but I feel that things that have happened, even if I've dealt with them the wrong way, it's God's his total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good. So that's how I feel.\nSay that again. People that I've grown up with neighbors from when I when I was younger, that I was close to different friends that I've had along the way, friends who are more like family. So yeah, they've had positive influence.\nNo. That was recent. Something happened. I was able to participate with my church on Sunday, I was a Pentecost. It was Pentecost Sunday, meaning it was 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And so I was able to participate in our prayer session that we had at my church and that was really made me very happy.\nThat I'm smart. They would say that I'm smart. That that I handled difficulties very well. And then I dress well.\nI don't want to change anything. I do want to just be a better me. So be a better person. So I am working on listening better, communicating better and and accepting my weaknesses better as well as my strengths.\nNo. That's a good question. I would have. I would have told myself to. To do what I know to do to do what I know. That which is right. And. To do what I know is right and let everything else. Let the other chips fall where they may. But to do what I know to do is right. And to go forward.\nI am very proud of the fact that I am a Pentecost. I am very proud of the fact that I don't give up.\nBye and thank you. Thank you.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, based on the interview:\n\nI didn't specifically mention having depression in the interview. However, I did mention being out of work due to \"the money issue,\" and having to put my nursing studies \"on the side\". I also spoke about moving to LA because I was out of money in Hawaii and wanted to start over. These experiences may have been related to depression.",

         "Okay, looks good. So if we can just move around a little bit to activate the Kinect until we see a green skeleton looking thing up there. There it goes. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and start up the virtual human that you'll be talking to. When it's over, will you just go ahead and ring this bell so I know that it's done? Okay, great.\nWill it let me know that I'm done? Yes.\nOkay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? I'm doing alright.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally? Originally, I'm from California. I'm born in Glendale.\nNice. How do you like your living situation? I'm not too happy with it.\nWhy? Just unemployed at the moment. But I'm actually seeking, doing what I'm supposed to be doing. There's some prospects there, but hopefully I'll learn something today.\nIt can be tough to find a good job these days. Do you have roommates? Yeah.\nWhat is it like for you living with them? Well, I have one as a girlfriend, so I consider her a roommate. Lover type thing.\nOh. How close are you to them? We're pretty close.\nHow do you know them? I met her last year. We've been through some troubling times, but we're starting to see a light at the end of them.\nThat's good. Tell me more about that. The troubling times?\nYes. Let me see. Well, I got into a DUI last year and lost my job. I'm a truck driver by trade, so that kind of threw me way off. Having a $1,400 a week job and then going to nothing. Plus losing my license really threw me off. I haven't really found anything that I was interested in, so I started cooking. I was trying to see which other route I could go as far as having some kind of a career. I'm choosing to go into the culinary field, but meanwhile I still have to work. It's hard to find a job without going to school. I applied at RAL, so hopefully I'll get that job. I should have that job, actually. I'm starting to see a light at the end of that tunnel now, little by little.\nThat's good. What's your dream job? My dream job would be probably forestry service. Out in the wilderness.\nHow did you decide to do that? I have a lot of love for animals. I'm an exotic animal trainer by trade. I don't like people too much. Being outdoors, I've always enjoyed being outdoors. That's how I like being a truck driver. I've traveled the world. I don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or in an office. I'm more of an outdoors type of guy.\nYeah. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips would be, I spent a year and a half in Japan on the lower island there. They built that bridge, the largest bridge in the world. I went there to work for an all-white tiger act, working for the Japanese circus. It was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of Americans. That was one of the islands also that they bombed. There was a lot of negativity, but I pretty much have a good outlook on life. Especially during those times. I enjoyed myself, all the traveling and meeting new people and eating different diverse foods. It was a good experience for me. All that whole experience was pretty good for me. Traveling around with circuses. It's been great.\nNice. What are some things you really like about LA? There's not a lot that I like about LA, but I like Hollywood. I like the movie industry. The huge... different ethnics of people here. I enjoy talking to a lot of foreigners. I like to see where it came from and what it's like there.\nYeah. Traffic's ferocious. Yeah.\nWhat are some things that make you really mad? Traffic. Ignorance. Being disrespectful or whatever. Other people being disrespectful towards you or other people. That's about it.\nOkay. When was the last time that happened? It happened on a daily basis. It seemed like... I ride the bus a lot. Or if I'm riding my bike, people tend to almost run me over. I'm not totally paying attention to traffic. I find myself sometimes having to wait to see what they're going to do instead of I having to ride away or stuff like that.\nThat sucks. Yeah. Big time. What do you do when you're annoyed? I probably sit there and vent. Speak my mind even though a lot of times it's by myself. Just like assholes or whatever. Wishing that I carried rocks in my back pocket so I can... It happened so much where it just amazed me at what people would do sometimes. You almost get run over. I probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis. If I wouldn't pay attention, I'd be up shit creek.\nYeah. How hard is that? It's hard with dealing with people, especially trying not to react because there's consequences to your reactions.\nYeah. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? It was with my girlfriend and it was about being honest. I'm pretty honest with... I'm open and honest about anything and everything. What it was about was just her lying to me, telling me that she had told our landlord something and that she had done something in that aspect. I come to find out a week later that it was a total lie. I just didn't like that at all.\nYeah. How did you feel in that moment? Let me see the word for it. She just said, I don't know now whether I can believe anything she said. I felt hurt that we'd been in a relationship for a little bit. That's probably one of my biggest pet peeves is being honest. I don't hold back. I'm pretty honest with anything and everything that I do or say. If you're lying about something, you're always having to cover up, moralize with the lies that you already told. It took a lot from me trusting her now. Now I'm like, is it truthful? Is it not? It's kind of hurt our relationship.\nI'm sorry to hear that. It's not involving. What are some things you like to do for fun? Fun? I like going to the beach. I love shooting darts, but I haven't done it in a while. I love to paint. I got into watercolor painting. I'm pretty gifted at that. I want to try some other mediums. I love fishing. I haven't gone in a while though. I like driving a truck. My job, I really, really enjoy it. I don't like driving through cities, but usually when I'm in the middle of the night, I see all the stars. I like stargazing. I see if I can pick out some of those astronomy stars up there. I'm a pretty easygoing guy, so shooting pool, sunshine, just what I like.\nThat's great. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Probably playing with lions and tigers, wrestling a baby elephant in a mud puddle.\nOh my gosh. Just enjoying myself. Awesome. How close are you to your family? Not. I don't have much family as it is. At least here in the States I don't. My mom's from Central America. But I'm not close to. I have three brothers, one sister, and I'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings. I speak with one brother quite a bit. My other youngest brother, I just rather not, I converse with him, but I try to keep it on a professional basis. My sister I don't talk to at all. My other brother underneath me, I haven't spoken to him in years. So I'm just close with my mom, my niece, some of my nephews, and that's about it.\nOkay. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yes.\nTo avoid them? Yes.\nYeah, I just don't talk to them. I don't call them. I don't ask about them. I talk to my mom quite a bit, my brother quite a bit, but I just don't bring up those subjects. Or if they are brought up, I just usually say, you know, that's on them, and I really don't want nothing to do with them. What does that mean?\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's been hard lately. It's been probably hard for the last, going on a year. You know, it depends on my thought process at the time. Like I said, I've been looking for work quite a bit. So just wondering why I don't get calls. I just have racing thoughts. So, or I get depressed, you know, or I worry about things that, you know, that really I have no control over. So, you know, lately I've just been sleeping a little bit too much. At least for me, because I'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a night, and now it's changed to about eight to nine hours, and I'm still tired. Do you feel that way often? Lately I have been. Probably about the last few months.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. If I don't sleep well, then I just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me. So, you know, I'm more of a guy, I love the work. And if I'm not, then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head. And so, you know, like if I'm busy, if I'm doing what I, you know, in whatever job I do, I kind of, you know, get into it. I enjoy it. It's something new for me. And so I can think about, you know, either work or I can go home and then think about this. You know, I don't have to worry about, you know, money, you know, bills getting paid. And I can just concentrate on other things, either doing the things I like or maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend.\nHow do you cope with them? How do I cope with them? I just try not to think about it. It's not about whether coping with it or not. I just do. It's I'm more of a guy that just, you know, it may take me a moment to say that I'm coping with something. But, you know, if I have no control over it, there's nothing that I can really do about it. The only thing I can do is continue to do what I'm doing. And that's actively looking for work, actively going out on interviews, talking with others about work so I can just kind of, you know, get back to, back to basics. You know, I just don't let a lot of stuff bother me. It does bother me, but I try not to let it continue bothering me.\nYeah. Has that gotten you in trouble? My moods, I mean, yeah, money. I mean, you know, my past, I got a past history, so which kind of tends to bother my, my hiring process. I don't know if I'm going to get hired, so I got to deal with different, different type of employers who are, say, felony-friendly and stuff like that. And I try, you know, I've taken classes on, on how to interview, how to answer some of the questions, which, you know, come up quite a bit. And I kind of reflect back on that, but I just, I got to keep putting it into my head that that's not who, who I want to be anymore. So, or, you know, I've done, I've done my time, so to say, but I took the time, you know, the last time I just took a lot of time and, and tried to work on the issues that were bothering me. So, you know, towards positive stuff, I got my GED, different things, took a lot of classes, thought about going to school, looking to go into school, and anything that would kind of change my old ways and, and try to move on to more productive activities.\nMm-hmm. That's good. Do you feel like therapy's useful? I still didn't hear you.\nDo you feel like therapy's useful? That people have been deceitful? Can you repeat that one more time? Why don't we talk about that later? All right.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? I've been diagnosed with bipolarism.\nHow hard is that? It's tough if you don't, you know, I don't medicate, so, I mean, I have been on medications before in the past, but again, as I try to live on, I try to live life on life's terms, and I just, you know, I know the medical establishments always want to label something, and what I don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills. You know, I've been on probably every manageable pill that there is for that, and, you know, some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough, and so I just try to cope with things with just my life skills, you know. I don't want to be using drugs. I know certain drugs work for like three to four months, six months, and then they go, well, here, I'm going to try you on this, or I'm going to try you on that, and it's just an ongoing process, and I probably for about the last two years, actually about three years, I kind of just said, you know what, that's it. And whether it's different than, or if I would be on meds for it, I don't think so, you know. It's still the same stuff. I still get the same problems, and I still get the same anxieties as if I was on medication for it or not, so I just, you know, deal with it, you know. Sometimes it's not good. You know, I get irritated at people a lot. I don't like people. I don't like crowds. I don't like obnoxious people. Usually I'm going to be quiet, so. But I got a person, you know, it's not to that personality, but I think people can see me and just say, don't mess with this guy, or, you know. But still, you know, I like, I ride public transportation quite a bit, and you know, you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there. Sometimes I got to get off the bus. That's how I deal with people, because if I just know there's consequences if I didn't deal with it that way. So I just let it go. I'd rather take the time on getting off the bus, waiting for the next bus, and hopefully it's not that bad. Did I have a problem before I got out? Well, I don't know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out. The thing is, I know other people, I have a lot of ups and downs. So I know a lot of, in my younger days, people would tell me, you know, when I told them that I was diagnosed with bipolar, that a lot of remarks were like, oh, that's what's wrong with you. We wish that you would have found that out years ago. And like I said, I don't think the meds really work, but what I do, I think time kind of, you know, getting older kind of, you know, makes it work. You know, me dealing with life.\nHarvey? I talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while, recently, and it helps a lot, you know, just to get out my anger, my thoughts. A lot of people, other people may not understand that, but a therapist is, I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out, whatever is bothering me, whether it be people, you know, other issues, you know, whatever the case may be, I just think talking about it. And they're such good listeners and can come in, you know, they give me the same advice that I would give myself or that I would give to others. But it's always helpful to hear from somebody else, somebody who supposedly has, you know, are, you know, they go to school for this.\nRight. But it's good to be there. It's so good to hear. Yeah. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Well, I don't go anymore, so I kind of miss it. You know, like I said, I miss it a lot, actually, but it's just one of those things, I just deal with it accordingly, you know, if I ever get a chance to go through therapy again, I probably will.\nWhy did you stop? Well, monetary reasons and, you know, I don't have health insurance. There's a lot of things that, you know, I'd like to do, but I can't, you know, money situation is not that great right now.\nI'm sorry. How do your friends describe you? They would probably describe me as an energetic, outgoing person, once I get to know people. I laugh a lot. But it would probably tell you that I'm also very serious and a hidden person. I don't reveal a lot.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my boss. One of my bosses, when I first started with exotic animals, he was real, you know, he was German and they didn't teach, I don't know what he saw in me, but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and showed a lot of confidence in me and also built confidence in myself. And sort of let me know that there's nothing that I really can't accomplish if I put my mind to it.\nThat sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Okay, perfect. So I'm going to go ahead and shut this down and take your mic up and then we just have a quick post for you to",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nI was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which has been tough to manage, especially since I choose not to take medication. I've been on many medications in the past, but I felt like they were just experimenting with me and none of them really worked for me in the long run. I prefer to cope with life using my own skills. Even though I don't medicate, I still experience the same anxieties and problems. I get irritated easily and don't like being around people, especially in crowds or with obnoxious individuals. Lately, I've been sleeping too much and have racing thoughts, especially concerning my job search. When I don't sleep well, I dwell on these things. I used to go to therapy weekly, and it helped me to get my anger and thoughts out. I miss it, but I stopped going due to financial reasons, as I don't have health insurance.",

Your answers are totally confidential. Where are you from originally?\nLos Angeles, California.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nThe Southern California lifestyle, the beaches, the active lifestyle.\nOkay. What are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic, the pretentious people.\nYeah. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nMy teachers.\nTell me more about that.\nI don't know. Certain teachers got... Spiritual teachers that I find a lot of guidance from.\nWhat are some things you like to do for fun?\nI like to skateboard. Awesome. And just stay active, stay healthy. Anything that's outdoors and active and healthy. Hiking, biking, rollerblading, skateboarding.\nThat's good. Do you travel a lot?\nNo.\nWhy?\nNot really in a position to travel financially.\nI understand. What do you enjoy about traveling?\nIf I could, I'm sure I would enjoy seeing all the different cultures and places and meeting all the different people and all the interesting structures and food.\nYeah. What do you do to relax?\nI meditate. And I sit down. I meditate. And I skateboard. Well, I can meditate on my board.\nCould you say a little more about that?\nI meditate. It helps me relax. Sometimes if I don't really feel like skating hard, I'll just go for a nice sunset skate and meditate, a nice two hour skate and just relax.\nThat sounds like a great situation. How hard is that?\nIt's not that hard. You just gotta get to the skate spots. I usually like skating. There's some good skate spots in LA, streets in LA. The beaches is always good. Nice. Just, it's really not that hard at all.\nOkay. What are some things that make you really mad?\nThe situation with my life right now, I can't find a fucking job. I just need a job.\nIt can be tough to find a good job these days.\nI don't even care about a good job. I just need a job. Anything that pays. Just gets hard after a while.\nYeah. Can you tell me about that?\nI mean, I applied from anywhere and everywhere. From entry level to management to anywhere in between. I can't find a job. I can't get a job. I'm trying.\nYeah. I'm sorry.\nIt is what it is. Do you feel down?\nYeah, it's pretty depressing. It's hard. It sucks.\nYeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nIt isn't.\nDo you feel that way often?\nYes, that happens often.\nWhen was the last time that happened?\nLast night I couldn't sleep.\nWhy?\nJust thinking about my situation. A car payment was due yesterday. And I just, I don't know if I have what it takes to continue to do this. You know, I survive day by day trying to see if I can eat at the end of the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression?\nYes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nAbout three years ago. Four years ago. Couple years ago.\nWhat got you to seek help?\nMy mood was just not right. I was always feeling down and depressed and lack of energy, always wanting to sleep. Lack of interest. Do you feel like therapy's useful?\nI've gone to therapy. It has been useful for me in the past. Is it useful for me now? I don't know, I don't have health insurance. I would love to talk to someone. I just feel like I don't have anyone. So I don't depend on anyone.\nYeah, I'm sorry. Did you think you had a problem before you found out?\nOh yeah, I've always felt depressed in my life.\nWhat were your symptoms?\nLack of energy, wanting to sleep a lot, lack of interest. My appetite was uncontrollable, either lack of or I was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things. Having noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?\nYes.\nCan you give me an example of that?\nMy sister just passed away.\nI'm sorry to hear that.\nIt's all right, six months ago. And I became homeless and jobless two weeks ago. Homeless and jobless two weeks ago. And I got to a point where I just missed her and I wanted to be with her.\nYeah. How close are you to your family?\nPretty dysfunctional family. You know, really can't depend on them. That's why I just depend on myself, so.\nThat sounds really hard.\nIt is what it is, what are you gonna do?\nYeah. I'd like to give up, but my parents just buried their daughter six months ago. They don't wanna bury their other daughter. So. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nI don't know. I don't know, I just, I just haven't had good luck. I was a corporate manager for 20 years. And, who would've known 20 years ago what advice I would've given myself because I tried to commit suicide instead of returning back to work. And so now it's just, it's been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and get my life back together. I don't know what advice I would give myself when I started with my corporate job 20 years ago. Okay, I didn't know I'd be here 20 years later. You know?\nYeah. When was the last time you felt really happy?\nReally happy? A couple days ago this week, I've been trying to make ends meet. I've got a lot of things prouding. I've got a lot of things that are happening for me, but I need like two more weeks here in LA so I can connect the dots. But financially I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. So I was happy because I was getting callbacks. Things were starting to look up for me, but it's just time again isn't on my side. So my car is packed and I'm hitting the road and I'm taking off and I'm leaving LA. How would your best friend describe you?\nLoyal, emotional, strong, and a little bit of a\nDo you consider yourself an introvert?\nI have been lately. I was an extrovert for 20 years when I was a corporate manager. And now I am quite an introvert and I stay to myself.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nCircumstances in my life I don't feel as confident. I don't feel as charming and as social.\nOkay. What's one of your most memorable experiences?\nI don't know. It's hard to say. Can't really answer that one.\nOkay. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nThank you.\nGoodbye.\nBye.\nOkay.",
         "Okay, here's my story with depression, in my own words:\n\nI've struggled with depression for years, officially diagnosed about three or four years ago. But honestly, I think I've always felt it to some degree. It got to a point where I realized my mood just wasn't right. I felt constantly down, lacked energy, wanted to sleep all the time, and lost interest in things. My appetite was either nonexistent or completely out of control.\n\nRecently, things have been even harder. My sister passed away six months ago, and just two weeks ago, I became homeless and jobless. There was a point where I just missed her so much that I wanted to be with her. My family isn't really a support system, so I feel like I'm completely on my own.\n\nI used to find therapy helpful, but now I don't have health insurance, so it's not an option. It's tough because I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to. I even tried to commit suicide once, instead of returning back to my corporate job. Now, I'm just trying to pick up the pieces.\n\nI've been feeling really down because I can't find a job, even though I've been applying everywhere. It makes it hard to sleep, especially with things like car payments looming. I was feeling happy a couple of days ago because I was getting callbacks for jobs, but I don't have the money to stay in LA long enough to follow through. So, I'm hitting the road again.",

         "Should I move my arms around? So that just shows that it's active and we know that it's active. Okay, so now I'm going to do something with you. And now I'm going to start up a virtual chat. I'm going to ask you some questions in the chat with you and when you're done, show us how you're done. And I just go ahead and bring you in.\nDo I push a button to start or does she start on her own? Okay.\nImpressive. Yes.\nFine, how about you? Here. Yes. Okay. Yes.\nThe weather. The weather mainly. Not the people, but some of the people. Stuff like that.\nNot as much as I used to. I used to be in school and travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that, but I'm not in school right now. But later I'll get back into school and I'll travel more. But right now, no.\nI don't enjoy traveling.\nGood question. You're actually pretty good. I studied physics and aerospace engineering, but physics mainly.\nYes, I am, actually. Right now I teach community college physics and astronomy. I'm doing research in physics also because I like that type of thing. I'm going back to grad school. Hopefully that's why I'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire.\nImpressive. A professor at a place like USC or UCLA or something like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest. You are actually pretty good at this.\nWho's the first one that you were happy with? There's a lot of people. The first one I guess is my AP physics teacher in high school. Even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major, he still was a very good influence. He told me that school was not about a grade but about learning.\nHow are you doing with your life? I'm pretty good, I think.\nWhen is the last time you had a relationship with your boyfriend? I'm single so I don't get into many arguments. But it's probably my brother about he doing some things too and playing a video game together. I know I'm pretty old to play video games but that's actually pretty good. It's probably something like that. Being angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right, that's all.\nWhat places do you see your parents? I see them pretty often. They're getting older so I help them with groceries and things like that. My brother, same with them. My sister, I tutor her kids, my nephews. I see them about once a week also. Yes.\nI spend a long period of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody. That's introverted.\nWhat do you do for a living? I guess I play video games and I work out. I work out, I think, a lot. I try to at least.\nWhat do you do for a living? I close my eyes. That's about it, I think.\nWhat do you think is the biggest problem? Bad parenting. Parents are more self-centered, more into themselves, unlike previous generations. Parents aren't being parents, in my personal opinion.\nWhat do you think is the biggest problem? I guess... the thing is what's the real problem?\nWhat kind of Yawn does it take? Thank you.\nI don't really have a best friend. I'm biased obviously, but they are really good in math. I'm not really sure if you can't, not saying you can't get better than me in math, but the thing is, it's just that you get a certain confidence with it, no matter what it is you need to learn in math, you've always figured it out.\nI am patient, I think. And I am disciplined where I can spend many hours reading books that might not be important, but they might be important. I have to do it anyway. That's how I think.\nWhen I have a good workout, I'm doing well in video games, small, middle things like that. When something happens with my research type thing, mathematical or physics type thing, when it goes well, that puts me in a good mood. Thank you.\nRight now, it's a fact that research, that I did make it this far research-wise, that's all.\nInteresting. When you start off in school, you read about Einstein and things like that, he says general relativity and you hear about particle physics, you have no idea what it is, you know it's very complicated, things like quantum mechanics. And you start realizing your interest in that, but you're not sure if you can actually make it. And eventually, each step of the clock, time goes by, as time goes on, you get closer and closer, eventually you make the goal, you realize you are just not as good as Einstein, but you are up there, you can do research in physics, you can add to mass knowledge in science, and that's impressive that you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid. Okay.\nA few weeks ago when I got a good grade in a class. Thank you.\nCan you ever say it in English? Yes, briefly.\nMany years ago, yes.\nHow did you start doing that? I don't know, just growing up I always thought that was my dream when I was a kid, that's why. And I just went about doing that.\nHow did you get into the field? I was a National Guarder, I think about 18, 19. I got commissioned at 20, 21. I was only in for about a year, so I left at 22.\nDid you grow up in the field? Yes, not really.\nDid you grow up in the field? I don't think I did. I think I did. I think it's just something that I grew up already expecting to be, so it didn't really change me as much.\nWhat did you do in math or physics? Graduate school. And physics. Okay.\nHave you ever been in a math class? No.\nHave you ever been in a math class? No.\nHow did you get into the field? It depends on how I work out really hard the day before. If I work out pretty hard it's bad, but if I don't work out it, I don't know, it's hard. I guess moderately. Thank you.\nYes. It's okay. I'm probably like I am now. Normal, I think. Not as happy about everything, but still pretty okay. I can still function.\nHave you ever been in a math class? No.\nMaybe slightly. Sorry. No. Yes.\nYes, I have changes in my thoughts. Okay.\nWhy not? I'm applying to grad school again. It's been a while. And slightly apprehensive. Happy that it looks good, but apprehensive that it might not be good. Things like that.\nWhy not? What do you mean by that? I know it's a computer, but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school? I understand. Okay.\nI agree. No, not really. Probably keep doing what you're doing, even though I'm not that old, believe it or not. 20 years ago I was probably 15. No, no. Almost 15. Just keep doing what you're doing. I think I was very lucky in the way it worked out. If it was a little bit different, I don't think it would have worked out so well. Even though it's not perfect now, I think we're doing really well, personally. Thank you.\nSame here. Goodbye. I'll keep this on. Take this off now? Yeah.",
         "Okay, here is a summary of my experience with depression, written from my perspective based on the provided transcript:\n\nI wouldn't say I'm overwhelmingly happy all the time. I'm pretty normal, I think. I can still function, though. I do have changes in my thoughts sometimes. I get slightly apprehensive, especially now that I'm applying to grad school again after a long break. I'm happy that things look good, but worried they might not be good enough. My mood is definitely influenced by external factors. A good workout or doing well in video games puts me in a good mood. Success with my physics research also makes me feel good. It's more like I'm functioning okay, not necessarily feeling intense happiness.",

         "Okay, great.\n\nOkay. So now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and ask you some questions. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. I'm going to put the doorbell right next to you. So you can ring the door once you're done.\n\nDo I see her?\nYeah, you'll see her. There she is.\n\nWow. Here's your doorbell.\nThank you.\n\nOkay. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and to welcome them on you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully welcome. Are you okay with this?\nYeah. Yes.\n\nSo, how are you feeling today?\nFine.\n\nHow are you?\nI'm great. Thanks.\n\nWhere are you from originally?\nBorn and raised right here on the west side.\n\nReally? Venice Beach. Awesome. What's the things you like about LA?\nEverything. The beach, the weather.\n\nOkay. The girls. What are the things you don't really like about LA?\nNothing. Okay. Traffic maybe. I can't even remember.\n\nWho's someone that's been a positive employee?\nMy family. I'd love to hear all about it. My mother. She's a very good-hearted person. Gives me good advice.\n\nThat's good. What are some things you like to do for fun?\nFamily comes first. Family's number one. Go to the gym. You know, exercise. Go to the beach. Party every once in a while. Watch basketball, football. Okay. Take trips. Go to Vegas.\n\nWhat's the last time you had that?\nWhich one?\n\nWent to the gym last night. I have friends that live in Vegas, so I go there often. Enjoying the travel?\nI just take a trip, get out. Get away from the city for a minute. But I'm a city boy, so it can't be way too long. You know, head up the city.\n\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI don't go to the beach.\n\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nOh, that's been a problem over the years.\n\nWhat's the only thing you worry about?\nI don't know. I just have a little anger, I guess. Anger management problem.\n\nWhen was the last time you had a problem with someone?\nProbably only yesterday. I forget what it was about.\n\nWhat do you do when you're in life?\nI go to the gym.\n\nWhat are some things that will be really annoying?\nPeople.\n\nTell me more about that.\nI don't know, just people. Just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes.\n\nOkay. What's your dream job?\nDream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Plan Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far, the past 10 years. Then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX. I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA Airport.\n\nNice. What's one thing that most number of people experience?\nWhat, working at the airport? I guess during the holidays there was some girl that worked there. I had a crush on her, but she turned out to be a lesbian. She's beautiful. Yeah.\n\nHave you ever served in the military?\nNo.\n\nHave you ever been diagnosed with a disease?\nNo. I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No.\n\nWhy did you stop?\nI just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped.\n\nI'm sorry you're late.\nNo problem. It's not your fault.\n\nDo you think it's their disease?\nExcuse me?\n\nDid your parents just help you?\nIt wasn't when I was a teenager.\n\nTell me more about that.\nWhat, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know?\n\nHow have you been doing lately?\nI'm not going forward as fast as I want to.\n\nThat sounds really hard.\nYeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is.\n\nHave you done anything to avoid it?\nTo avoid what?\n\nGoing forward?\nI guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would.\n\nExcuse me?\nYeah, I guess.\n\nAre there?\nYeah, it's like mood swings, I guess.\n\nMood swings? Are you triggered by something?\nIt could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know?\n\nWhen was the last time you had a mood swing?\nOh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today.\n\nReally? How did you fool around with me?\nAngry.\n\nHow hard is it?\nYeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know?\n\nDo you think you're going to be able to control it?\nNo. Okay.\n\nHow are your best friends?\nMy best friends? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay.\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nThe goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially.\n\nCan you give me an example of that?\nOh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted.\n\nThat's great. Thank you. Is that even your address?\nYeah. Yes.\n\nCan you give me an example of that?\nOh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay.\n\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nWell, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then.\n\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nTo do what?\n\nWhen was the last time you were in the house?\nI don't know. Today. Happy to be here.\n\nThat's great. What are some things that you really put into your life?\nUm, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah.\n\nWhat would you say is something you've best followed in?\nMy best qualities? Just that, uh, qualities. Just that I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What do you mean by qualities? What comes to your mind? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay.\n\nI think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay, bye. Can I take her home with me? Is she, um, is she supposed to be a psychiatrist or can I hire her? Okay.",
         "Okay, so, looking back, I think I've dealt with some stuff, especially when I was younger. As a teenager, around 14 or 15, I remember being very restless and destructive. I even went to rehab after doing some time, but I ended up escaping and going back to jail. Lately, I feel like I'm not moving forward as fast as I want to, and it's hard. It's like I have mood swings – I can snap over something small. It happens all the time, even yesterday or today. It's related to anger, and I struggle to control it, especially when I'm dealing with unpleasant things in my life. My friends see me as outgoing and humorous, but they know I have my issues and understand when I get mad easily. I'm proud of the goals I've accomplished lately, like getting my GED and my job at LAX, but I regret some of the decisions I made when I was younger, like not staying in school and joining a gang. If I could give myself advice from 10 or 20 years ago, it would be to stay in school and control my anger.",

She's going to chat with you for a bit and then when she's done she'll let you know.\nI'm going to put the doorbell back over here and then you can let me know when you're finished.\nYou can just ring the doorbell when she's done talking.\nYes.\nFine, thank you.\nMontreal, Canada. I moved here with my mom when I was in high school.\nYes. Oh, it's very cold there in the winter and our summers are very short.\nIt was very easy. I custom pretty quick.\nNo, not very much anymore. I don't have much family in the United States. It's pretty expensive to go back home so I only go every couple of years.\nMeeting different people, different places, different customs. Well, we just recently went to San Francisco, same custom and everything, but the city was very different and I enjoyed it.\nI took general education and child development. Right now I work part-time for an independent auto repair shop.\nI'm a very good driver.\nJust working with people, talking to people.\nNo. I'm shy sometimes so I stay to myself a lot.\nI walk along the beach, bike riding.\nArrogant people. I try not to get angry but sometimes I do try to learn. I'm learning to walk away from things but sometimes people provoke you. I'm getting better. I'd say 75% under control.\nAbout a month ago with my daughter and her finances. It's really hard. You don't like arguing with your children.\nI have two girls. One is 23 and one is 26. One lives in Louisiana and one lives here. Now that they're older, yes.\nSatisfaction of giving love to someone else.\nWorry. Well, unfortunately when I was young my sister was kidnapped so when my children were growing up I worried about them a lot and I didn't let them do things a lot on their own. Now it's easy because they're grown and they live on their own so it's a lot easier now but you still worry even though they're grown.\nI'm sorry, what did you say? Oh my goodness, they're spoiled rotten. They have everything.\nWaking up when my kids were younger on Christmas Day I loved it.\nNo.\nYes.\nIt's been exactly two years and two months.\nLoneliness, depression, especially after I didn't have any family members left in the United States so I went to counselor and then the group therapy.\nYes. I mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your likes, your dislikes, your problems and sometimes somebody else is going through the same thing you are and you can share what you're going through and what can help make it better.\nHow has seeing a therapist affected you? It's affected me a lot. It's helped me cope with things. It's nice to have somebody else to talk to.\nYes, I didn't want to admit it but after a while and feeling depressed for so long I knew I had to do something.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Pretty good.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just getting more positive, better.\nThat's good. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's not. It's about 50-50. Some nights I sleep good and some nights I don't.\nThat sucks. What are you likely to do to improve on? Lack of energy the next day.\nHow hard is that? It's hard, especially if you get two nights in a row of no sleep.\nWow. When was the last time you felt really happy? During the holidays, so a couple of weeks ago.\nHow did you feel about the holidays? I felt good. Holidays always try to, you know, Christmas trees and kids and everything. So usually is a good time makes me feel good.\nNice. What are you most proud of in your life? I was married and raising two children and having two kids. I'm very proud of that.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoy. Wow.\nThat's great. Thanks. How did you decide to decide? Well, I went from full-time to part-time work and there's not as much work in the automotive field. So I decided to go back to school.\nEasygoing, fun, easy to get along with. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mom. She's raised four kids single-handedly and was a very hard worker.\nOkay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't give up. Be positive and anything you try to accomplish, Ken, you can do it.\nIs that anything you regret? Not going back to school sooner.\nHave you done anything to avoid it? No, because I was raising two kids by myself. So now that they're grown, I have no excuse. So I'm doing it.\nThat's good. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm friendly. I'm a hard worker and most of the time I'm easy to get along with.\nCan you tell me about that? Like I said, I'm a hard worker. If you give me work to do, I'll do it. Most of the time I'm in a good mood so I'm easy to get along with.\nWhat are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Like I say, bike riding or walks on the beach. The beach is very relaxing.\nThat's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome.\nGoodbye.",

It's sunny and it's near the ocean. The traffic can make it difficult to drive around between different places. And there's a lack of open spaces if you're not near the beach. No. I haven't finalized any travel plans. Listen to music. Yeah. Why? Well, I tend to excel at things that have to do with spending time alone versus things that have to do with spending time outside with lots of people. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm reasonable. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? Maybe yesterday I was trying to figure out how to pack something into the car. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm very good at it. What do you do when you're in love? I breathe in and out like that. Okay. That's good. What are some things you like to do with time? Like jogging, walking, bicycling, reading, listening to music. Music. Awesome. What did you study at school? Math, engineering, computers. Are you still working on that? A little bit, yeah. What do you do now? I'm a student. I'm going back to school for biological sciences. That's not interesting. How did you decide to do that? I started doing some reading on some textbooks. Okay. What's your dream job? Medical doctor. Really? How hard is that? I guess it depends on what type of medicine you practice. I understand. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I have a mentor. I have a lot of positive thoughts and suggestions. How do you know them? So I met someone through a class and then they worked with them professionally. So it's, I guess you could say through an academic or professional channel. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I can't think of one at the moment. Okay.

I didn't understand any changes in your behavior or thoughts or anything. No. Do you feel down? Sometimes. Can you tell me about that? What do you wanna know? Whatever comes to your mind. Well, I think sometimes I do think about challenges ahead of me. And I can be a little daunting and I feel down. That sounds really hard. It is very hard. How do you cope with that? Go for a walk, read a book, listen to some music. Are they triggered by something? I don't, I mean I'm sure they are. I'm not specifically sure what triggers anything. Maybe feeling overwhelmed or not feeling particularly tied to some task. Is going to a therapist helping you? I don't go to a therapist. Okay. How are your best friends describing you? Reasonably smart, inquisitive and curious. How do you know them? I guess through classes. How close are you to them? Somewhat. What would you say are some of your best qualities?

         "Okay. Yes. Very well.\n\nThat's good. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was about. Probably took a year or two. Well, you know, being away from my family, being away from what I was used to in New York, the neighborhoods, the people, and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here.\n\nWell, the weather. Can't beat the weather. It's generally always nice. It's not too hot. It's not too cold. It's creative. I do like movies. I like the beach. The traffic. There's a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here and more distant and unfriendly than other places.\n\nI was a history major.\n\nI do demonstrations in high-end supermarkets.\n\nTo be a screenwriter. That's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. It's hard because I don't always maintain focus and motivation. I let other things distract me.\n\nI've always been interested in films ever since I was a child. I just always was writing and had an active imagination.\n\nIn the last probably almost ten years I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well, I've always traveled, even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So, yes. Seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am. Seeing how they live and taking in the sights. I went to Kenya. That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on. On the safari and just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible. Oh yeah, that's one of the great experiences of my life. I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called Charmel Shake, which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world, which is hard to believe that Egypt would, but it was just amazing. I didn't go scuba diving. I went snorkeling.\n\nWhat do I do to relax? I like to listen to music. I like watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of whatever might be on my mind. I do meditate every day. I like to take walks in nature that's always calming, especially down by the ocean.\n\nIt depends. Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper. A lot of times I'll do a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself, which is something I've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. Also, since I meditate, I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past. Some things that make me really mad. I guess I think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along and make the world better.\n\nWhat was the last thing you argued with someone? Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film and I didn't think it was done very well. We had a fun argument about the movie. That just happened yesterday, so that's on my mind.\n\nIs there anything I regret? Is there anything I regret? Yeah, there have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued them. Certain jobs. When I first got to Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to become a GRIP and I probably should have pursued that.\n\nHow did I decide to do that? I don't really understand the questions. Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important and no matter how you feel, you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do.\n\nNo, but I've been depressed in my life. For the most part, I've been feeling good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. Sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down. I can usually get out of it pretty quickly. Sometimes financial concerns, sometimes an opportunity, how do I explain it? Financial is one way that if I made another decision, I might have more money or my life would be different.\n\nNot really. I feel pretty much the same.\n\nWhat got me to seek help for? Let's come back to that. Generally, talking to someone has helped when I did do that.\n\nPretty easy. I don't have problems sleeping. Usually I'm grumpy. If I don't sleep well, I feel tired and irritable.\n\nHow would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier.\n\nI think it's tough, it depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write, so that means that I have to spend time alone. When I come out of that, I'm extroverted. I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood.\n\nMy best qualities. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likeable personality. People have said that. I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's a cool detachment. I'm creative, intuitive.\n\nYes. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy. I had breakfast, I was happy. Sun was shining.\n\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I do remember snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun, the powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond, almost beyond like human in a way. Just more in touch with everything, the universe. It would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day, but...\n\nWhat am I most proud of in my life? I think I've helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, I've written some screenplays, I've had some good relationships. Good relationships, just being connected with someone else, spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels.\n\nIt could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something. If I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive, it puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye bye.\n\nSometimes she would ask me, it would sort of tweak, and then it would ask me this question about not being able to do it. I don't remember it really getting specific like that. Oh, like what? Do you remember what question you're talking about? It kind of asks me, well, are you depressed? Sometimes. It will explain that, and then it was like, well... Then it did something, and then it was like, well... Did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, we... There was no bridge to that conversation. Got it, got it.",
         "Okay, so, I have experienced depression in my life, though for the most part, I feel good. I do sometimes feel a little blue, especially if I let regrets creep into my mind, like missed opportunities. I can usually pull myself out of it pretty quickly, though. Financial worries can also get me down, making me think about how different my life might be if I'd made different choices. Talking to someone has been helpful in the past when I felt down. My friends probably wish I was a little happier and more accomplished in achieving my goals.",

All right. There she is. So I'll bring her back up in one sec. Okay, so now I'm gonna bring her up and she's gonna ask you some questions and chat with you for a bit. And then when she's done, she'll let you know, and I'll put the doorbell back over here so you can alert me when she's finished, okay? All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today.

Where are you from originally? Pensacola, Florida. Really? Why'd you move to LA? I met my wife in Mississippi and she stays out here, so. Oh. When'd you move to LA? I moved to LA, what, 2004? About 16, 12 years ago, something like that. That's a long time. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It was pretty hard, you know, different environment.

Nothing really makes me that mad anymore. Really? Yeah. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm very good at controlling my temper. That's great.

No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Sleepy. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? In my behavior, they got better. Tell me more about that. I started going to, I gave my life to the Lord, started going to church, so I'm just trying to do the right things now. How did you decide to do that? Because I knew that I needed to, and life was just not the way it should be. I see what you mean. How have you been feeling lately? A whole lot better. That's good.

Knowing that how evil the world is, and your son has to live in it. How hard is that? It used to be hard, but with prayer and faith, everything's gonna be all right. That's good. When do you think it's gonna get good? They're very fast. Tell me more about that. When we were growing up, things was different, you know, but now the world is just way worse off than what it is, than what it was. What's one of your most memorable experience? Flying in the airplane for the first time. Cool. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I was nervous, because I've never been on a plane before, so. How did you feel in that moment? Felt a little nervous, scared, you can say. I'd love to hear about when you're trip. Yeah, this one, I flew back home, you know, visited home, went back for about a week or two, seen my family, hadn't seen them in a couple of years, so that was pretty cool. Okay. What do you study at school? Right now, college, I'm studying, I want to be a culinary arts, so I want to be a chef. Awesome. How did you decide to do that? I like cooking, so I just decided to just go ahead and, you know, get an education on it. Are you happy you did that? Yeah, I'm happy. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? I'm proud that I made a decision to serve the Lord and do the right things. Last night. Just because it's like I know that everything's gonna be all right, and I have no more worries, so I'm happy. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Cooking. Cooking puts me in a good mood and seeing that my kids are happy, that's cool. Is there anyone you regret? I'm not gonna regret it. Nope, can't say I regret anything. I really don't know. No prob, bye-bye. I feel like someone's really asking me questions.",
         "I have not been diagnosed with depression, but I can say that my life wasn't always the way it should be. Lately, I've been feeling a whole lot better because I gave my life to the Lord and started going to church. I knew I needed to make a change, and I'm trying to do the right things now. Making this decision has made me feel like everything's going to be alright, and I have no more worries.",

         "Okay, thank you.\nI'm Ellie, thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions and get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this?\nSure.\nOkay, so how are you doing today?\nI'm doing fine, just a little tired.\nWhere are you from originally?\nCalifornia.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nUm, the weather.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nFear of earthquakes.\nI see what you mean. What did you study at school?\nPsychology.\nCool, are you still working on that?\nI am, I go to Harbor College.\nAre you happy you did that?\nI am. I wish I would have went sooner, but better late than never.\nYeah, what's your dream job?\nProbably I'm not sure, I never really thought about it. I want to work in the field of psychology. But I'm not sure if I want to work with children or adults. So I haven't really decided.\nOkay, do you travel a lot?\nNo.\nWhy?\nI don't know. I just don't. Maybe once a year.\nWhen was the last time you traveled?\nJune actually, I went to Orlando, Florida.\nAwesome, do you consider yourself an introvert?\nSometimes.\nBut not as relaxed I'm sorry What do you do to relax?\nWatch TV, read a book, talk on the phone.\nWhat are some things that make you really mad?\nMad?\nMy mom gets in my business. Other than that, I guess just frustrations with my son.\nDo you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo.\nWhat's the hardest thing about being a parent?\nThe hardest thing is raising a child with a disability. Not knowing how you can help him.\nThat sounds really hard.\nIt is, it's very hard. I don't sugarcoat it at all.\nWhat's the best thing about being a parent?\nJust having my children, they're a blessing, I love them. With all the good and the bad, it's a part of me. I just love the fact that I'm helping mold them into good human beings.\nHow close are you to your family?\nWe're really close. My family's small, we live within blocks of each other. But yeah, we're close.\nOkay What's one of your most memorable experiences? Good or bad. What comes to your mind?\nMost memorable? Just giving birth for the first time. It was just amazing. My son is nine now, so I still remember it like it was yesterday.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nLike I was being born again myself. I don't know how to explain it. It's just very emotional.\nOkay Is there anything you regret?\nI don't know. I guess I have a lot of regrets. But none that I really want to mention. I guess I understand.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nStay in school. Don't get emotionally involved. And let people deter you from your goals.\nHave you done anything to avoid it?\nOh yeah, definitely.\nDid you want me to... I'm okay I'm okay, I mean, I'm pretty easy going. For the most part I don't really have a temper per se. Things frustrate me more than they anger me.\nWhat's the last thing you argue with someone?\nOh, that's easy. With my mother, she's like I guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to socialize. She feels that I'm married with children. So I should stay at home like 99% of the time. And I wanted to go out and socialize with some ex-co-workers. And she basically kind of put me down for it. As if I don't spend enough time with my children. It does. And I love my mom. I hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her. Because I always think, gosh, I don't want to get mad at her. And then something happens to her the next day. But she gets kind of intrusive, I don't know.\nWhen was the last time you felt really happy?\nOh, I know. After the semester ended when I noted that I did well in school. Because it had been a long time since I went to school. So when I received my grades, A and a B, I was like, wow, okay I can do this. And it made me happy. And that was about a few weeks ago, I guess.\nThat's great.\nThank you.\nThere's some of it that's been impossible to do. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life.\nMy mom, I know, it's good and bad. I mean, for the most part, my mom's been a positive influence. You know, it's just sometimes, you know, she gets a little Like she wants to re-raise me or something Like she doesn't understand that I'm an adult I'm going to make my own decisions now. Pretty much have to let me do what I need to do. A lot of heavy breathing I mean, I walk sometimes when I get a little frustrated Whatever, I'll just go take a walk You know, or just try not to think about it.\nThank you.\nYes.\nYes, the Navy.\nI was 19.\nYeah, yes.\nI didn't have any other options.\nI am, I probably should have stayed in a little longer. I was only in for four years, but You know, I wanted to experience life outside the military So I did my enlistment and then I got out. It made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that You know, did not join the military. I could notice a big difference as far as, you know, how I lived my life and how they lived theirs. Just made me a little bit more responsible.\nThank you.\nI worked in the medical field for about five years.\nAnd, oh, thank you. But it wasn't for me, I wanted to do something a little bit different. I didn't want to do patient care. I wanted to work with people, but not necessarily as a patient care provider. So I started going to school and then I met my husband. I stopped going to school. Got married and I started working in the telecommunications field. And then we, you know, conceived our child and after that You know That's it.\nI think I'm caring, well, I know I am, I'm very caring. You know, I'm very honest to a fault sometimes. You know, I try to be as honest as possible with people. Sometimes it can hurt their feelings, but You know, you gotta be honest. You can't let people think that, you know, you're not trusting. And if Yeah, probably, I never really thought about it. I don't know. Maybe, I don't really think about it. I just try to be the best person that I can be. You know, so That's all I can do, I can't live for what other people think. I can only do what I need to do.\nI don't know. I never really thought about it. I guess it's just, you know, being around my kids. You know, I just love being around my children. That always puts me in a good mood.\nThank you.\nOkay, like I said, a little tired, you know, but You know, for the most part, okay. You know, dealing with situations different Well, I go to bed really early, so As long as I go to bed early, I get a good night's sleep. But I wake up early as well, so It's kind of like Get in bed a little bit, I go to bed at like 8, 8.30 And then I wake up at like 1, 1.30 So Very moody Very irritable, short tempered, I guess. If you're a little bit more sensitive If anything, I think I'm thinking more positively You know, like I said, especially with my son having a disability You know, I look at it as if You know, it's not all bad I mean, he has challenges But I'm dealing with them a lot better You know, as opposed to feeling sorry for him Or feeling sorry for myself You know, I'm just finding more avenues to work with him You know, different resources to help him As opposed to just feeling guilty or sad or depressed about it.\nThank you.\nNo.\nOccasionally.\nWho does it?\nWhat color is your best friend?\nI don't know, can we skip that question?\nWhat color is your best friend?\nGreen. Seems to be the word, kind of like Yeah, probably green, like Naive a little. But at the same time, smart. I think she'll describe me as smart.\nThank you.\nOkay.\nNo problem.\nBye.\nOh, I'm sorry, I gotta push the button. It was fine, I kind of skipped one question though.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nI wouldn't say I'm currently depressed, but I have dealt with feeling guilty, sad, or depressed about my son's disability in the past. Now, I'm actively trying to think more positively and find resources to help him instead of dwelling on negative emotions. I also get very moody, irritable, and short-tempered when I don't get enough sleep. I go to bed early, around 8 or 8:30 PM, but I also wake up very early, around 1 or 1:30 AM.",

         "Okay. From here from Alhambra. The weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. What are some things you don't really like about the weather? Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Is that amazing? How did you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? Yes. What are you doing now? I'm a photographer. Nice. What's your dream job? Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. Okay. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. I see. How do you like your living situation? It's fair. It's not the greatest. Because of being an apartment manager, I do have free rent, but I have to stay there a lot. That's tough. That part does. The free rent part is very good. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Oh gosh. My most memorable experience. That's hard to say. Well, I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. What else do you like? Oh, well I guess some sports success when I was in high school. There were a few things that I was happy about. And some art pieces I've made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death. Those are very memorable and not good though. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters. So my family. How close are you to your family? We're fairly close. Most of them live around in LA. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. Wow. When do you think of the music? Mostly very talented. Just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. Seems like they were all hooked into social media. What do you do to relax? I go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. And I... Well, there's some kind of injustices that happen. Not big deals, but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend. And when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it. And we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set up time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up. When they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that part is upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up at the office. They just need to please the school to maintain the account. So often when that something like that happens, it means they will not send you out to work at that school again, which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. That's how they do things. So that is upsetting. How do you cope with that? Most of the time I dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that might be better. That's good. Yeah. How are you at controlling your company? Pretty good. I usually might, in the moment I don't really lose it, but later I might vent or something like that. But on the location I wouldn't do that. When was the last time you argued with someone? Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. I have a friend that I'm sharing the car with today. We were arguing on where to go first. So we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And then after this was one of the things is over, then we're going to do some more of her things. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Is that what that is? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I'd say 1980. Yeah, I believe it was 1980. What got you to see the doctor? My father noticed some symptoms. My father passed away, but he was a psychiatrist. What were your symptoms? Well, I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon. And I didn't have a focus like for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all part of depression. Yeah. Isn't it that you had a problem before you found out? Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? Well, I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done. But I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. What sort of changes have you noticed since you came on the field? I think therapy makes you see what the... I thought of it as a filter or wearing a... As if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really... You see everything through that. So you have to... I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately? Or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. How have you been doing lately? I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I've noticed in my past. Right now we have a work slowdown. So it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule is too wide open. For me personally as a depressed person, I think that structure is really important. It gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere on time and interact with people. Those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed. I think I've noticed any changes in your behavior. Well, I don't know if it changes a little bit. I tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting let's say. But it's more negative. I have been thinking about how soldiers in the past, I don't know why, but during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been like to be in a front line battle with crude weapons and no medical help. I don't know. My mind seems to go there a lot where I'm just thinking about that. I've been looking at and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube and things like that. Or some other kind of like terrible doom type things like I was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that. Where I probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. Oh, you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not finishing college. I think I was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well. I didn't get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years. So that's a big regret that I have. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I think it would have been to, at certain points, I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals, just the logistics. I was an art major and I had no car. So a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and also to meet at away locations. I think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time. What would you say as somebody who has holidays? Well, I've been told I'm very patient and also I have some original artistic ideas. So those are good qualities. I'm very loyal and also I support my friends. I'm fairly generous with them. Tell me about something you really enjoyed. Let's see. Let's see, I really enjoyed it. I had a nice experience just photographing a soccer game recently. I really enjoyed that. I love listening to you talk. Okay, I think I've answered everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. It's my pleasure. Thank you, goodbye. Yeah, that was very interesting. So I'm going to go to the top and then if you want to go back to the other computer.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, from my perspective:\n\nI was diagnosed with depression back in 1980 after my father, who was a psychiatrist, noticed some symptoms. I wasn't sleeping well, I was laying around the house all day, waking up late, and I lacked focus, especially when it came to finding a job. I even remember going to job interviews and then not being able to bring myself to go inside.\n\nI went to therapy for about three years, and my psychiatrist eventually felt I was doing much better. I did get to a much better place, but I know I have to constantly monitor myself for signs of slipping back. I still have good days and bad days. Therapy helped me see depression as a filter, like wearing \"depression sunglasses\" that distort your perception. I try to consciously remove those glasses and double-check if I'm seeing things accurately or through a depressed viewpoint.\n\nLately, I feel like I'm slipping back a bit, especially during periods of unemployment. I've noticed in the past that a lack of structure makes it easy to fall back into sleeping too late and procrastinating. Structure is really important for me; it gets me out of bed, forces me to be on time, and requires me to interact with people, all of which are beneficial. I've also noticed I've been focusing on negative things, like reading about ancient battles or watching shows about animal attacks.\n\nOne of my biggest regrets is not finishing college. I think I was already struggling with depression in my senior year and wasn't coping well.

         "Okay. So now I'm going to start the virtual human app and I'll hand you the doorbell when you're done. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in the same sense of their environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'd like to get your questions started. And please feel free to comment anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with that? Yes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay.\nWhy did you move to LA? This was 30 years ago. My cousin went out here and said, I might as well go. Nothing happening here in Jersey City. I got to come out. That was in 19...\nHow was it to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Just like you find your nine-to-five job to pay the rent and a lot of things to do here.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? Probably the film industry and the celebrities and the glamour and excitement. I fit in real good.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, just like probably the homeless problem. You've got to see the derelicts and they eat out of the garbage. We're the homeless capital of America. You've got to see this all over the place. Yeah. I see what you mean.\nWhen did you study at school? I just graduated high school, but I have an interest in writing.\nWhat made you decide to do that? I have an interest in reading and words and creating stories and being imaginative. I haven't written anything in a while. That's my drug. I don't drink or smoke or do any kind of drugs, but writing was always what got me high. That's good. Yeah. But I haven't been inspired. I recently just met a young girl who's a stand-up. Her routine is so interesting. I could write a novel of her routine.\nTell me about that. Oh. I don't know. Actually, Facebook, she told us all this stuff about how she's friends with a homeless woman and a homeless woman can inherit $4 million if she gets off the street. And she has an autistic sister who's very strange, but is crazy about guys. And she's like 20 and wants to be a comic, and she's really talented. I've been Facebooking her, but she hasn't responded.\nOkay. You can believe it's all an introvert? Yes.\nWhy? What does introvert mean? Well, do I keep everything inside of me? Probably. And I'm always thinking probably all the time. Thinking about my problems and just too much analyzing. Yeah.\nWhat are some things that would be really nice? Probably lazy people, people just living off the government and going to get their Section 8. They just don't go out and just work and fend for themselves and take care of themselves. Just people who are so lazy. And some that go, they walk around, they're in the traffic with their signs, give me money, please help me, please help me. Help yourself. Help me, help me. That's what makes me mad.\nWhat do you do when you're annoyed? I try to just deal with it. Because I don't like being annoyed or angry. I don't really curse that much. I try to just stay calm, intelligent. So I just try to deal with it and suppress it and work through it.\nHow are you at controlling your anger? I'm okay. But lately I have had outbursts and I regret it. Only probably due to lack of sleep or just the tension that's rising and problems going on. But I try to just stay calm.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? And what were you about? Oh, oh wow. I don't like to argue, but I was arguing with a girl who was working at a movie theater and she was giving people wrong directions on which line to stand on. And she was causing like hassles. And I was saying, you know, they have to stand over here and don't send them over there. They won't get into the film screening. And there was some argument going on. And of course I was in the right. She was giving wrong information. This was at Grumman's Chinese Theater.\nOkay. How close are you to your family? Well, I do have a twin brother that I live with, but we don't get along with total opposites. I have a sister I haven't seen or talked to probably in 18 years. I have a younger brother. Don't see him much. And what's sad, I just have a mother who's still around. She's like 70, 75. Probably in the last three years, there's no communication, no phone calls, no Facebooking. Just separated. It's like we don't interest each other.\nWhy? Just the way that she's always, I don't know. I never had a father. The father left when I was four. She's always been a housewife. She's always been on welfare and food to dams. I just never really worked. I just wish she did something more. I do love her. We don't have a relationship anymore. I understand.\nThere's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Who's been a positive influence? Probably good writers. Probably some of my favorite authors who inspire me to write better.\nCan you speak to that? I don't know. I like the writer like William Goldman. He's a very good writer. He wrote Marathon Man and he writes about how to write screenplays. He wrote The Princess Bride. He's been an inspiration.\nNice. What do you think is the new kid? What was that? What do you think of today's kids? Today's kids? Oh, I can answer that with three words. Two aspects. There's just too much video games, too much technology, too much skateboarding. In the 70s when I grew up, we were locked in rooms or sitting in front of screens for hours and hours and hours. This is 2013. Life is hard for everybody and everyone's just trying to get through it. It's tough.\nHow would your best friend describe you? Generous and funny and fun to be with. Just an all-around great guy.\nHave you ever served in the military? No.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Yes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed? Six years ago.\nWhat got you into health? I probably went to a free clinic. Things were bad. I was probably interested in medication. Then when they offered it to me, I decided not to deal with it. I don't want to take medication or anything. I was taking Lipitor for high cholesterol and getting too much side effects, fatigue and sleeplessness and dizziness. I won't take medication.\nDid you think you had a problem before you found out? I'm a creative person. I've just suffered depression probably all my life. I have my highs and my lows. Just feeling blah. Walking around and just not feeling anything. Not feeling good about anything or excited about anything. Bored. So bored all the time.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Lately, I've never felt so bad in my entire life. Probably the last few years have just been really bad. I'm in survival mode. I'm sorry you're doing that. It's pretty bad.\nHave you noticed any change in your living here in the country? Change. I've just become a boring person. I go to all these free events all the time trying to save money. I'm out every night. I'm rarely at my home. I'm out all the time. Going to events, having a good time then. But it's like I'm just trying to shut out life. I live in movie theaters just trying to just block everything out. That's not good.\nDo you still go to therapy now? No.\nWhy don't you stop? I wasn't really into therapy. He was a Korean guy who said, yeah, you're depressed. You have suffered depression. I may be bipolar, but I'll deal with it.\nHow easy is it sleeping in a good night's sleep? Believe it or not, if it's just dark and quiet, I'll sleep pretty good. Eight to ten hours. Sometimes, because I snore, sometimes I'm not allowed to sleep. Sometimes I get kicked out of the apartment. It's a small apartment. I've slept on alleyways. I've slept in doorways just to experience it. I'm not homeless. That's when I can't sleep. That's when I get two or three hours. There's your answer. Inside, I can sleep okay. Because I'm always fatigued. I'm very tired, and I'm a heavy snorer. I snore like a chainsaw. They have it.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? Whew. I'm okay. People can tell. I'm just drowsy. Probably irritable. I just want to let darkness come. Let me just get at least four, five, six. Some sleep at all, please. If I get some, then I'll be okay.\nOkay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I had a gambling addiction. I messed my whole life up. I pretty much lost everything. When was the last time I was happy? I probably took $60 to a casino. Turned it into $1,200. I had $1,200 in my pocket. It was exciting. Of course, the next few days, $1,200 was liquidated. It went because I was stupid and got greedy. That's when I'm happiest. Go to a casino and win or just stay even and not lose anything. That's where my adrenaline is.\nHas that gotten you in trouble? Yes, it has. It put me where I am today. Too much blackjack. It's bad. Otherwise, in the past three years, I've had... No, not much. The gambling is not worth it. In the end, you lose everything. Yeah. Apology accepted.\nWhat would you say of somebody who has followed you? I am generous. I'm a nice guy. I'm not going to do you wrong. I'm very reliable. All-around good guy. I'll help you out. I'll lend you a few dollars. I think I'm all right.\nNothing in your debt? No, nothing at all.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I just hope that there is a second chapter in my life at my age. Right now, I'm just floundering, killing time. It's probably been four years now of nothingness.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Manage your money better. I would never think I would have six figures in the bank, but I did. It evaporated very slowly. The advice is probably just don't gamble. Keep your money. Try to find some other means of excitement. For me, being at that blackjack table with big wages was my reality. That reality was better than being outside the casino. My reality was right there. At Texas Hold'em, I did okay. I didn't lose much. I'm a pretty good player. Blackjack, it just took everything.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life? That I had those 12 years. I owned a casting company for 12 years. I provided people for movies and television shows. A lot of audience work. I made a lot of money for 12 years and traveled. I had the time of my life. At least on my deathbed, I can say from 1996 to 2008, I had a lot of money. I had 12 years that I never thought I would ever have. Money, money.\nWhat is something you really enjoyed? That I really enjoyed. My excitement is getting into a big movie premiere at the Gromit. You know, you get the tree and you get the popcorn and soda and you see the stars. That's about as exciting as it's going to get right now.\nAwesome. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Alright. Take care. Bye.",

         "Okay, great. So everything's all set up now. Sorry about that. No, it's okay. So if you just want to give me one second, I'll be right back. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Something's bound to happen, right? Of course. Let's start this again. So we'll just keep going. So I'm going to do something for our purposes. It's kind of spooky. All right. So whenever she's done, she'll let you know, and then you can press this button. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm here to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people's lives. And I'm going to be making a video about this. Okay. So I'm going to start the video. I'm here to learn about people, and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you two questions to get started. And please feel free to comment at me. Your answers are very confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So how are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I am from Los Angeles. I see. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? It's the center of everything. You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, being in LA also you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But you know, you live with that. I see. What did you study at school? I was a business administration major, so I studied business. And after I finished college, I pursued a career in retail operations. Are you still doing that? No, as a matter of fact, I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years. So I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. What made you decide to do that? A couple of factors. After working numerous years in the retail business, I switched over and worked in a creative business, which was a graphic design firm. And I captured a lot of knowledge in the human resources side because I was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a small company. Are you happy you did that? Yes, I'm very happy I did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it's very helpful. That's great. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? Well, my dream job is I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am an independent contractor. I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs. And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle, but I also enjoy what I do. I'm not under as much stress as I used to be. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not totally outgoing, but I'm not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle, maybe more towards outgoing, but I'm not totally outgoing. I mean, when I'm around other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself. Can you tell me about that? Oh sure. A couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had bypass operation and it had to do with stress and things like that. I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If I meet someone new I don't just openly say, well you know, I've experienced this, this, and this. I just basically, if it comes up I won't deny it, or if it comes up and I feel like it's something to talk about, I will talk about it. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom, my mother, and she's a senior citizen, she's alone. So what I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that. That's actually very therapeutic. How are you at controlling your hunger? I'm not a short-fuse kind of person. It takes a lot to get me really angry. So as far as my temper is concerned, there's not much to that. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? That sucks. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I had a slight chance it was going to help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point, or it would kill him. And that was really tough. It was a really tough decision to make. That sounds really hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My mother is a very good friend of mine. She has her issues, I have my issues, but we are not divorced. We were just separated. We still have a relationship where we still speak to each other. We just don't live together. And the relationship with my mother is really great. She's very understanding. She's 82 years old, so she likes having me around, which is good because she's in her later stage of her life. I guess it's good that in its own way, maybe fate has taken place because someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing. She feels comfortable with me there. I think there's a comfort level she feels with me there, especially being her only child. What's something you feel guilty about? Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things that I did to hurt my marriage. The things that I did, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah, I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had. We were growing apart. When she was away, my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. I spent a lot of time in the casinos. What eventually happened was I spent a lot of money. Obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship. It had to do with trust because it was devastating to my wife. How did you feel at that moment? When it came to light, I felt very guilty and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. I'm sorry. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not at all. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, not really. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping, so no. That's good. Do you feel down? No, not at all. Have you ever studied using an indicator of your health? No. The only thing I can say is after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. I tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that. That's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy? Probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I guess the number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight. In general, just be more healthier physically. As far as mentally, just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish. How do you cope with that? Just one day at a time. I try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch TV. I do things that I know that if I can help myself, I do things to help myself. Is there anything you regret? There's a lot that I regret, obviously. My marriage, my working career. I had a long career with this major food chain. Basically, because of my gambling issues, I ended up ruining a very good career. At this point right now, there's not much I can do. I can't change what's been done, so I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me every day. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself. Make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent, but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things, but deep down, I don't think as a person, I'm a bad person. I remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had an illness, a compulsive, obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill. That I was a sick person just trying to become healthy. Every day, that's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night, one day at a time. How hard is that? It's not as hard as you think, but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you. It could be okay for other people to do certain things, but I cannot do those things anymore. How would your best friend describe you? Most of my best friends describe me as probably easygoing, generous, a nice person to be around. They were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage, which is still not over yet. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning, around six o'clock. I go to a local park. This park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles, and I take a brisk walk in the morning, get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. Then after that, I go home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax, and then just kick back for the rest of the day. Then the next day, I do the same thing again. In the morning, I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch TV, whatever. Just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. Nice. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Okay. Lock yourself out. Okay. I actually got comfortable talking to you. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, that's pretty cool.",
         "Okay, here's my experience with depression. While I haven't been formally diagnosed with depression, I've definitely had struggles that have impacted my mental well-being. A few years ago, I had a heart attack related to stress. Looking back, I recognize that my compulsive gambling was a major issue. It stemmed from working long hours under a lot of stress and it became a way to cope. It led to significant financial problems and a breakdown of trust with my wife, ultimately contributing to the end of my marriage. I felt immense guilt and like less than a human being when the extent of my gambling came to light. I wouldn't say I feel \"down\" now, but I do have regrets about the pain I caused and the career I ruined. Now I focus on taking things one day at a time, trying to be at peace, meditating, and doing things that help me stay healthy and avoid those past behaviors. I think of it as a recovery process.",

         "Okay, great.\n\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nSo, how are you doing today?\nI'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay.\nWhere are you from originally?\nI was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast.\nWhy did you move to LA?\nOriginally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again.\nHow easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?\nIt's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nNot at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends. I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nDepends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy.\nOkay.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed.\nWhen was the last time that happened?\nA few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nI've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to really hit me.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nGood. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nLast night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about?\nA lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really wanted to work and I ended up and it was partly due to I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty tough.\nCan you have done anything to avoid it?\nWell some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have been it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were.\nI think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself.\nI mean it's possible. I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah.\nThat sounds really hard.\nWell it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by drinking and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's been better.\nThat's good. How do you cope with them?\nWell like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet.\nAre they triggered by something?\nThey're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to this. It's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nI'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep. I don't know. I get up, I toss and turn all night. You know and now it's yeah I don't sleep too great right now.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well?\nIt's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad.\nOkay. How long ago were you diagnosed?\nI think three, three, four years ago. It was when I had been given taken stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So yeah that was kind of a turning point. But unfortunately it happened after everything went bad.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nLooking back on it I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain and I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean I was paying a lot of money to go see doctors and they were doing they it didn't help it didn't work until I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little late now\nWhat got you to say help?\nThere really wasn't any choice I had to. I was a mess. It was either I was self-medicating or I was affecting my work everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I just had to make this different but again it was too late because then my review came up a few months later and after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off. But it was at least that and not firing me. But so I got help but it wasn't soon enough. Not as much as I should.\nI go to a couple of meetings so that I can keep control of that aspect and there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately being unemployed my employment ran out I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. Somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. And then there's you.\nRight.\nJust saying stuff out loud is like getting the stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of drugs you're taking all that stuff that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can do. Something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing.\nIt's sort of it has its ups and downs. You know I'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a day and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to being self sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just I have to deal with real life which is It has its own challenge.\nYeah.\nIt can be tough to find a good job.\nYeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nIt was probably a couple of years ago. The thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job. I was making these great videos with this person that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree. And we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger bigger life that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and everything was going really well. I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So.\nWhat are you most proud of?\nProbably the educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about the world around them so that I feel like that was a really good thing to do. It was part of my job. It was an interesting life. We were trying to come up with new ideas for because we would put together videos and stuff to give to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of and so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it.\nOkay.\nI think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.\nThank you. Howdy. Bye.",
         "Okay, here’s a summary of my experiences with depression, from my perspective:\n\nI've been dealing with depression for a few years, though I was initially treated only for anxiety. Looking back, I'm angry because I feel like I lost everything – my job, relationships, my old life – due to a chemical imbalance in my brain that wasn't properly addressed. I sought help and saw doctors, but it wasn’t effective until I found a psychiatrist who correctly diagnosed me and prescribed the right medication.\n\nBefore that, things spiraled out of control, especially in a past relationship that I feel guilty about because I wasn’t medicated properly. Now, the medication helps me manage things. I still get upset and depressed, but I don’t completely lose it for days like I used to.\n\nI still struggle with dwelling on things, even things from high school. I used to self-medicate with alcohol to slow my mind down, but the medication has helped. I cope by constantly occupying my mind – watching TV while playing games, or using the computer while watching a show. My thoughts are triggered by everything, and it feels like I never get a break. I'm also a light sleeper, which doesn’t help.\n\nCurrently, I attend meetings for support and have access to a psychiatrist through the city, but only see her a few times a year to keep my medication coming. Talking about my feelings, even to a program like this, helps me process and externalize the mess in my head. The chemical parts of my depression are getting under control, but now I'm facing real-world challenges like unemployment and struggling to become self-sufficient again. I remember a time a few years ago when everything was going well, and I felt like a normal, happy person. I don't know if I'll ever feel that way again.",

         "That's true. Research shows that that's really beneficial. All right. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and stay and secure in my room. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you OK with this? Yeah, I'm OK with it. OK. So, how are you doing today? Um, I'm OK. I guess. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from LA. I'm basically an LA kind of guy. Cool. What are some things you really like about LA? Um, you know, the weather. It's usually pretty sunny and temporary. I like the climate really a lot. I like the girls here. I don't like the traffic, but I like the city. I like the Hispanic population quite a bit. And I have a lot of friends here, so I guess I don't want to be anywhere else. Uh-huh. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Like I said, the traffic. I was on the 405. That's always kind of crummy. The cost of living, that's really terrible about LA. It's always expensive. And it just seems like LA is one of those places where you either have a ton of money and fame and fortune or you're down in the ghettos. Yeah. Do you travel a lot? I have. I've been to a couple of places, but very brief, mostly for school. I went to Arizona and New York and Montana, a lot of anthropology and archaeology, field trips and things like that. Nothing I'm doing right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like getting away from the city. I was in Yosemite last year in the summer for vacation. That was kind of nice. Yosemite was really neat to see. But just basically getting away from the city, getting away from the job, getting away from the stress here. Yeah. What did you study at school? I actually studied political science and I also studied economics. I'm a big kind of political junkie, so I naturally kind of fell in line with that kind of field of study. Are you still working on that? I was, but I lost my job. And that's kind of a bummer. I lost it maybe a year and a half from now, maybe two years. The economy got bad, and the budget cuts got bad, and I wish I was working there again. Yeah. What's your dream job? Well, I wanted to be a lawyer at one time. I wanted to be a lawyer, and that's why I took political science, and I took a double major in economics. And the sad thing I regret is to get into law school, you have to take this entrance exam called the LSATs. And I studied really hardcore for about a year. And I took the CAD test, and like an idiot, I didn't feel right about that day. It was kind of an off day. And it was like the big game at the Super Bowl. I just don't feel like I did well. And I canceled the test, and so I kind of regret that. That sucks. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not really shy at all. I'm definitely not shy. But outgoing, I'm not flamboyant. I talk to people. I don't mind talking to people. I don't mind meeting people. That's fine with me, but it's not like I'm dying to meet anybody. Yeah. What do you do to relax? These days, I play guitar. I taught myself how to play guitar. I should actually be doing more of it. But I also like to exercise. I'm on a diet right now, but my diet's been terrible. Eating habits have been terrible. But the exercise part is just great. I love to exercise. I love to run. That's one of my best things to do for stress is run and work out. I just wish that my eating habits were a little bit better. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? My temper could be definitely improved a lot. A lot of times I feel I'm one of these introvert type persons. When it comes to I don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and having a good time, whatever. When I'm mad, I really don't want to be talking to people. I don't like to yell. I don't like to scream. I don't like to hit. I don't like to fight. I kind of close down a lot. I just want to be left alone. Sometimes I tend to drag it on for longer than it should be. The wife doesn't like it too much. Maybe I just don't want to talk about it. I just don't want to deal with it. I kind of close down and shut off for a little bit. Geez. It doesn't happen too often. Maybe with my wife, probably something silly. Who knows? Can you give me an example of that? Let's see. I guess sometimes I'm a married guy, but sometimes there are times I like to smile at a girl or get a girl's attention. I don't know. I never do anything about it. I never get the phone number or sometimes I like to talk to people, I guess. Well, that's a good question. I guess I always handle it the same. I don't ever wish to ever change it. I never want to handle things differently. I'm pretty comfortable the way I handle things. I think that it could be a lot worse than shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that, and that's just not me. I think the best thing to do is kind of get a lot of breathing room, a lot of space, and I don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently. I just don't basically know what else to do. And the last thing I want to do is start talking about feelings or any of this. That's the last thing I want to do. So I don't wish that I handle things like that differently in that way. Well, you know, I'm pretty happy with my family right now. I'm married and we have a baby along the way, which is kind of nice. We have some cats and a dog, a weenie dog. And my mom, I love my mom dearly. She has diabetes, which she doesn't control. She doesn't control it and it affects her health. It always has me worried about her and stressing out about her. She could do so much to prevent it and she doesn't. I have a good relationship with my mom. I love her dearly. And I actually have good relations with everybody, I think. I think I have a ton of family and friends that get along with me pretty well, actually. Yeah. There are times when it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep. Actually, I feel like I sleep like a baby. The only problem I have, I think, is I feel like sometimes you fall asleep and you have you're just going to sleep and you kind of like joke, you almost kind of like fall. It's like a falling sensation or something like that. It doesn't happen that often, but it happens. For the most part, I sleep like a rock. I sleep really good. That's good. What have you been feeling lately? Well, right now, generally, I've been feeling worried and anxious and tense. The reason why is because I said my mom, at least today, I found out my mom, she didn't tell me the whole story and I'm kind of waiting until this is over so I can find out what's wrong with her. I'm worried about her. She's in the doctors right now, so that doesn't tell me anything good. I'm trying to find a job. So that has me worried too. The baby along the way. So that has me worried. I feel overwhelmed with a lot of things to do and a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me, but I have to handle it. Yeah. How do you cope with them? Well, I keep myself distracted. I keep myself busy. I feel like a busy body, and the more which kind of seems like it's not a good thing because I feel like I'm just adding more things on my plate. One of the things I do is exercise. I have to work out every day, but that takes an hour to change and start running and go through the whole thing of stretching and cooling down. It takes some time and then to shower and all that kind of stuff takes time. I have to do it daily. So I cope with it in that way. I also cope with it playing guitar. That's just more of a distraction. Keeping busy that way. It just seems like it's not working towards the goals that I need to do is find a job, which I should be doing. It's one of those things where I find there's no good jobs. I've been looking and looking and sometimes when I do, it's just not what I want to do. It just doesn't seem like I want to do these terrible jobs. It's probably harder than I'm thinking about it because sometimes I feel like it is hard, but it's not. There are ways I can cope with it. I just got to kind of accepted it a lot, internalized it. It's not something that's I'm not out on the streets or anything like that. It is a worry. I've never been diagnosed with PTSD. The last time I was really happy, I feel like nothing makes me happy no more. I learned a new song on the guitar. I feel like not even happy about that. I work out. Sometimes that kind of makes me happy. Running like fast and working out. That doesn't make me so excited or anything like that. It just makes me feel good. I have these times where I'm feeling good about myself, but I'm never feeling great. I'm never feeling happy. I'm never feeling sensationalized. These are old times where there's a few good times and a few bad times, but the good times are never extremes, never really good times and never really atrocious bad times. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I wish this diet would work out a little bit better because I'm the kind of guy who just likes rice and Mexican food and snacks. I feel like that I could change. I wish I could change my eating habits that way. I can because I work out so much. I feel like I do so much running and so much activity that if I got my diet in check, that would go a long way. I wish I also can change my desire to get ahead right now. I feel just so like the economy is so bad and things are so rough that it's pointless to even look for these kind of jobs. I just wish I had a little bit more inspiration and a lot more motivation to do things. Is there anything you regret? The one thing I regret is this LSAT thing, not canceling the test to begin with, because I'm sure I could have gone into school. But then again, it has me thinking, do I really want to pay a bunch of law school tuition and the cost of that just to be powered down with more work and things like that? There is this idea of justice and republicanism and things that I really adhere to that I fall in love with that I don't want to get away from. It just seems like it's a ton of work and money just for the small percentage of success that you might not be able to do in that kind of field. It just doesn't seem like it's worth overcoming the obstacles I need to overcome. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I have no idea. 20 years ago. I would tell myself maybe I think I've done everything really well for myself, except for the LSAT thing, which I regret on one hand and the other hand, I'm not sure if I regret because of the bills and all that kind of stuff. I've waited to get married. I waited to have a kid. I've been pretty cautious about this. I don't take drugs. I don't drink. I don't fight. I don't do any of these things that I think that real people have and they really ruin their life. I'm pretty happy and content with being cautious. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? Oh, my best friend. I think he kind of likes me. He wishes that I would do more things with him, but he works at night. I think most people, not just my best friend, but my wife and my rest of my family feel that I don't put a lot of time and attention to them. I mean, they think that I'm pretty great when I do give them my time of day and my attention. I don't know if I'm really there all the time. I don't know if I'm really, I'm always thinking about something else. I'm always thinking about something different. I don't know if I really can give them a real shoulder to cry on or if they ask for something, I'll usually do it, but I almost feel like it's like a chore. If they really need me, then I'll do it. If they're just asking for a favor, I almost feel I do it with a lot of lackluster, a lot of half-hardness. It's not because I hate them or anything. I really like them. It's just that I feel like I almost I don't want to say I owe it to them, but the mere fact that I'm their friend makes them somehow like it makes me, they rely on me. In times like I don't want to let them down. They are my friends, but at the same time, I just feel like it's more of like a chore to do instead of a willingness. It's just something that I do because I kind of have to. You got to do things for your friends in the end because they're your friends. In the end I do like them and they probably would do it for me. So I just do these things. Well, there are a couple of things that I do like that I feel good about myself. I ran the LA marathon. That kind of feels good. I graduated from college. That kind of feels good. The thing is, I don't feel like that proud of myself for those things alone. Graduating from college hasn't really made me successful. Running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim. They're like half merits. They're great. A lot of people maybe not have done it. A lot of people have excelled further. They're kind of like stepping stones that I still will no life long benefit from doing other than the fact that I can say that I've done. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Yeah, no problem. Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy being in this computer. Thank you. Goodbye. Oh, goodbye. I'm going to press this button now. I think we're good here.",
         "Okay, here's my summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nLately, I've been feeling worried, anxious, and tense. A lot of it stems from my mom's health issues, which are stressing me out. Job hunting is also a major source of anxiety. The baby on the way adds to the feeling of being overwhelmed. I try to cope by keeping myself busy, exercising, and playing guitar, but it feels more like a distraction than a real solution. \n\nThe problem is, nothing really makes me happy anymore. Even when I achieve something, like learning a new song or having a good workout, the joy is fleeting. I feel good sometimes, but I'm never truly *happy* or excited. My life feels like a mix of okay times and okay-bad times, but nothing is ever extremely good or extremely bad. I wish I could feel inspired and motivated again. The last time I was really happy is so far back I can barely remember it.",

         "Okay. All right. Thanks. Go ahead.\n\nHow are you doing today?\nI'm okay.\n\nWhere are you from originally?\nI grew up in Wisconsin, and I lived in Colorado for a bit, and then I lived overseas for a little while, and then I moved to California.\n\nWhen'd you move to LA?\nJune of last year so I guess it's been eight months something like that.\n\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nAt the most probably twice a year.\n\nHow does it compare to LA?\nWell my hometown is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of LA.\n\nWhy do you miss LA?\nIt's a good question. I've always wanted to live in California but I had been living in the central coast and I just have been coming down to LA like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me. The client I had who was really the main financial source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I'll give LA a try and see what happens. So I gave it a shot and here I am.\n\nHow easy was it for you that you still live in LA?\nNo not at all. It's a very very big city. I lived in Dublin in Ireland which is also a big city but European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy. So just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging.\n\nDo you travel a lot?\nI love to travel. I lived in Ireland and I traveled. I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica. I spent some time in Mexico.\n\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nI love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures and also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go.\n\nI'd love to hear about one of your friends.\nSure. I'm trying to think which was my favorite. There's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days and we went to 3 different locations. We went up in the Atlas Mountains which are beautiful. It's a really really cool culture.\n\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nMy most memorable moment of that trip was being on a bus and leaving Dublin and going down to the countryside and seeing how breathtakingly beautiful it is. Everyone sees pictures of Ireland or you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experience it. The pictures don't do it justice.\n\nWhat did you study at school?\nI have an undergrad degree in English and Psychology and a psychology minor and I have a masters degree in Women's Studies.\n\nAre you still working on that?\nNo, I use my English and Psychology. I work in marketing communications. I actually do sales. The psychology definitely comes into play. I guess my undergrad degree in English but really I took that on and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I wasn't wanting to teach.\n\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nI guess I'm not clear on the question. Let's come back to that later. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me.\n\nWhat's your dream job?\nMy dream job is being a motivational speaker and trainer and coach and traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people.\n\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nMy relationship is pretty good actually. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother. She was sporadic. I saw her sporadically growing up. My dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with. I got in communication with my biological mother last May and we've cleared things up and have been in communication since then.\n\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nSometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screen saver. I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got.\n\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI love to dance. I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharges my battery actually. Probably more than anything else. I like to be with friends. I love art and trying new restaurants. All those things are both relaxing. I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life.\n\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nDepends. If I'm driving not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it.\n\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about?\nLast time I argued with somebody. Probably would have to be with the LA Times about the newspaper delivery. The newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of, it didn't show up. I didn't realize that it wasn't there until late afternoon. I think early afternoon. I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10.30 in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. For a service that would pay for it for every day. I was really irritated. I was angry with the LA Times. I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. It was pretty frustrating.\n\nTell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently.\nOh wow, there are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program. It was from one of the coaches in the program. She was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be, we have meetings every week, classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with. She called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach. That hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god I have all these people I have to be accountable to and I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people. I just was, I don't know. So, yeah, I wasn't angry. I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it. Yeah, I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother.\n\nThe hardest decision.\nWow, there's been a few. Moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision. No, it wasn't even the hardest decision. It was such an easy decision actually, but telling my family about it was challenging. The hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family. I was 28 and I decided to, I chose to move to Colorado. And that was a pretty tough decision. At that point my family had been within an hour's drive of wherever I lived, an hour, hour and a half, and now they're going to be a 12 hour drive away or a plane ride away. So that was challenging.\n\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nOh, lots of things. I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful, beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin. And at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado. So there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single. That was another factor. And were interested in the things I was interested in. So Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit. So yeah, and then I found a job that I liked. The pay was atrocious, but I found some work that was really rewarding. So it all came together and I chose to move.\n\nThat sounds like a great situation. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nThat's a totally unrelated question. Relatively easily. It just depends on what time I go to sleep. If I'm out and I don't get home until 1130, then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today. But generally I can sleep through the night. I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks. But even so, even when I wake up from those or if I stir from those, I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily.\n\nAre they triggered by something?\nYeah, I'm sure they are. I'm in another transition state. I'm moving out of the house that I live in right now where I take care of an elderly woman. I have defined the financial means to support me in doing that. She creates a lot of anxiety in her state of being. She's exhausting and utterly depressing.\n\nHow hard is that?\nLiving with her is pretty hard. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done. I would never ever choose to do it again. Honestly, if I knew what I was getting into, I don't think I would have said yes to the situation.\n\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI feel trapped and helpless. There's no way out of the situation that I'm in. No matter what I do, it doesn't get any better. I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do. My money's not working at all. It feels pretty crappy.\n\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nI have in the past.\n\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nA long time ago. I was 15 or 14. It was over 20 years ago.\n\nWhat got you to see the outcome?\nI was suicidal.\n\nDo you feel down?\nOh yeah, I feel down.\n\nDo you still go to therapy now?\nI don't actually, no.\n\nWhy did you stop?\nI originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed. We had worked on what needed to be worked on. I was no longer depressed. Then I began therapy again later on. It was in my early 30s. Then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland.\n\nDo you feel like therapy's useful?\nYeah, depending on the therapist and depending on your intention. I don't go into therapy thinking, oh, I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years. I think that's ridiculous. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just that, not just creating a solution in that area, but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to worry about it.\n\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nLast time I felt really happy. That's pretty sad. It was at least a year ago. No, that's not true. It was when I saw my biological mother, which was last May.\n\nWhat would you say are some of your best qualities?\nMy best qualities. I'm strong, very strong-willed. I'm very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent.\n\nIs there anything you regret?\nAnything I regret? I don't think so. No.\n\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nDon't take life too seriously.\n\nTell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nOh, my ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends. Either going out a night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar, somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to... And then I have brunch with friends. I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day.\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nI am most proud of a few things. I've moved to places that I wanted to move to. I've done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something, been dear to my heart to actually achieve those goals or those... Yeah, I've done things that I've wanted to do, like move to Ireland and move to California.\n\nOkay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nSure. Goodbye. Bye. Just a little bit of a... Finish up with a quick post survey. So...",
         "Okay, here's my story regarding depression:\n\nI was diagnosed with depression a long time ago, when I was only 14 or 15. It was triggered by feeling suicidal. I did go to therapy then, and it was helpful. I stopped when I felt like we'd worked through the issues and I was no longer depressed. I went back to therapy again in my early 30s, but stopped when I moved to Ireland. I do think therapy can be useful, depending on the therapist and your own intentions. You go in to work on specific problems and find solutions, not to be in therapy for years.\n\nRight now, I'm feeling down. I feel trapped and helpless in my current living situation, taking care of an elderly woman. It's exhausting and utterly depressing. I feel like there's no way out, and no matter what I do, things don't get better. I'm not getting the work I want, and my finances aren't working out. It feels pretty crappy.",

         "She'll ask you some stuff, but yeah, she can understand. So when she's done, she'll let you know. I'll put the door up over here and hopefully it'll work. I'll try to sometimes assist in the thought of some of those. OK. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Boston. Really? When did you move to LA? About 30 years ago. That's a long time. Yep. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Oh, I love living in LA. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. Why did you move to LA? Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. The beginning of the first few weeks where it was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? Broadcast journalism. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. Are you still working on that? Nope. Why? Well, it's kind of a long story, but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just, once I had done that work, I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Yep. What's your dream job? My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Nice. How hard is that? Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to, I don't travel so much right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like where I'm from. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday. Cause I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international dateline. And I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay where native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part. And I got to be there for a whole weekend, just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come and they swim with you and it's amazing. It's just a beautiful, beautiful spot in the world. Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More shy. Why? That's a good question. Partly the first thing I think of is cause I've always been that way, but maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. So. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach cause I live close to the beach. So that's one of my favorite things to relax. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations, but not at people directly. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Not sure I have one at the moment. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That just makes me really mad. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. I didn't know that I could do it. I wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. So that felt like a really difficult decision, but in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time, it was really difficult to do that. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment. So that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm like great, but it's because I am worried. But I'm also confident that things are gonna work out. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either. Sort of like just a even keel. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, I got to go to my friend's work at the Motion Picture Academy. So I get to see all the Oscar nominated movies. How was it? She was there one night, so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again. So that was very pleasant. Nice. How would your best friend describe you? I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. Is there anything you regret? No, I really worked hard on that. I think there are lots of things maybe I would do differently, but there's nothing that really I regret. So what? Well, I just think that there are things that, like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good question. Don't worry about the small stuff and save more money. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, you know, the normal things, like I'd lose more weight than I would. I think be a little more fearless maybe. Be a little more bold. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't think I have any of those. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Well, I am self-employed, so I work all the time. So my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something I enjoy. So that would be ideal at this point, my weekends, if I were really busy. What are you most proud of in your life? That I've really been able to take care of myself and that I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do. I've done that. And I don't have regrets about things. There's nothing really that feels undone in my life. Sure, there's plenty of things I still wanna do, but I feel like I've done what I said I was gonna do. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, that's not so great. Well, it's okay. Both my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister, but they both live on the East Coast and I live in LA. And then my sister has two girls, so I feel very close to my nieces, although we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers, so they have other things on their mind. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my teacher. He's the person I learned my holistic body work from. I really like to model my work and my way of being after him. Like he's a good role model for me, the way he holds his work and the way he lives his life. That's so good to hear. How close are you to them? We're pretty close. We're not best of friends, but I know that I can call him anytime I need him. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or... Yeah, just spending time with my friends. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thanks. Goodbye. Bye. It worked again. That was where I was feeling... Okay, good. I'd like to hear that. Now I'm going to have you move over to the other computer so you can do a quick post survey about your experience.",

         "Okay cool. There I am. All right, thank you so much.\nI'm doing all right.\nYeah, from Maryland. Yeah, Maryland, Washington DC area like five weeks ago.\nIt's a lot less. It's not as nice this time of year. LA is a lot better though. There are a lot more people, a lot more going on. I guess I'm still getting used to it, it's coming slowly, but surely.\nI live in Culver City.\nI do.\nI have one. It's okay. I live in a really nasty house. It's cheap because I'm living in a friend's place and he's letting me stay there for half price, but the actual place itself is pretty horrible living conditions. But I'm moving soon.\nNo, I traveled. I would say I probably traveled more than most people in the US, considering that most people don't travel in the US. But I wouldn't call myself a world traveler. I enjoy the chance to get to see other walks of life and kind of like meditate on the specificity of my own. Given the parameters that I grew up under, like how different everyone else is, like how every life is totally. I mean, even just within the US, like seeing how someone in California grows up is so different from how someone in Maryland grows up. And then to think about someone in like Thailand or something growing up. It's pretty amazing.\nWell, it's been a while since I've been on a trip. I guess one of the last trips I did was to. A lot like two years ago, I went on a road trip across the US and that was pretty amazing. Though I guess the best two places on the road drove from Maryland to LA. This is before I actually moved out here, but I visited New Orleans and New Orleans was just this whole, even though it's part of the US, it's totally different than anywhere else. It's so unique. The culture there is so unique and the blend of like Caribbean and French and all these other influences into like the American South is so incredibly unreal.\n\nAre you capable of that?\nYeah.\nFilm. You know, that's actually a question I've been asking myself. My entire life I've had phases of interest. So when I was very young, I was really into keys and then tools. Like I'd go around collecting keys and then I go around collecting tools, like just every sort of tool. I had a toolbox. My parents have told me that I had a phase before that with balls. Then I was really into insects, collecting insects and reptiles and animals and then the dinosaur phase. At a certain point I got really into music, like first rap and then guitar and then acting. At some point in there, I remember telling someone that right now I'm interested in playwriting and poetry, but eventually I was going to be interested in film. I could kind of see the trajectory coming, but I don't remember what led me to that conclusion. I think I just always led a sheltered life as far as movies are concerned. My parents didn't let me see an R rated movie until I was in high school almost. I never saw an R rated movie. I was also very squeamish. I remember when I was fairly young, maybe like six, I saw Star Wars. The first scene of Darth Vader breaks the guy's neck. It's just a little scene at the very beginning and that freaked me out and I had to leave the room. So I'm not really sure how I got into film, but I've always been fascinated by how people interact and acting and movies in general.\nYes. To be a filmmaker, to be able to direct and put together and make movies. I guess direct, I don't use that word so much because I think of it more as like I want the opportunity to put together and make movies. I want involvement in all the processes, but the best parable for that would be a director.\nWell, it's a lot better when I'm not living with them.\nIt's funny you should ask. I've been thinking about it a lot lately. I think I'm closest with my dad. I get along with my brother and sister, but I don't. My brother's in a foreign country right now, so I don't have the opportunity to talk with him. But I spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else because I feel like he's the one who most accepts me and thinks positively about me. So I have a complicated relationship with my parents and my family in general.\nWell, on the Myers-Briggs personality test I'm an extrovert, but I'm not. I probably would consider myself extremely introverted. I see other extroverts and no matter who they're around they're able to strike up conversations. I'm a fairly shy person, inhibited person maybe. So I like to, but I'm working on it.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I can only just take screen saver.\n\nSo what do you do to relax?\nWell, in the past I would smoke weed, but I've quit smoking weed. So now I have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie. Or maybe go. If it's a worn-out sort of stress, then that's what I do. But if it's a more anxious type stress, I might go on an intense walk. Don't really exercise that much, but I like competitive sports and hiking.\nWell, I always like arguing. I wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper. I enjoy a vicious debate. As long as I won't revert to personal attacks in my arguments, I try to keep it on subject and try to explain myself as best I can, which can get frustrating because I'm not the best articulator of what I think. One of my weaker points I would say.\n\nWhat happened?\nI forget the question.\nLast time I had a heated debate was about the movie Boogie Nights. I didn't lose my temper exactly, but I get very passionate about it.\n\nWhy did they think it was the best movie?\nThey think that all of the stories within Boogie Nights, each of them could be their own separate stories. They just think that there's a complexity of character within the movie and that somehow it's like the end of an era, which makes it kind of like Casino and there's attention to detail of the different characters, how they interact in the plot. I think the heated debate became about that. Personally, it's not like a bad movie or anything, but I just don't think Dirk Diggler is that meaningful of a character. The way I came out of the movie is basically the same even though in watching it again, I was able to reevaluate it. There's nothing bad about the movie. There's good solid acting. The directing is good. The camera moves are cool. But for me it was meaningless. And then they were saying that a movie that I saw recently that I really did like was Django Unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme heated part of the conversation. In the movie Django Unchained, you have Django and Django is a two-dimensional character, but I don't think that necessarily takes away from what the big purpose of the movie is. And you have Dr. King Schultz who's this mentor character and the person I was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and because he was intelligent, there's no way he would have risked his life to save Django or would have gone into this second act where they go to this plantation to save Django's wife, etc. The reason for her giving that argument, either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't, is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themselves for someone else, which strikes me as like. Her basic argument was that altruism doesn't exist. It was a very Ayn Rand type argument. The only thing people do is serve themselves. All people are out to serve themselves. I'm not arguing that every decision has a mix of altruism and something. Even the most altruistic type decision, there's maybe kernels of self-interest in there, but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor. It led it to an extremely passionate debate. I don't think I necessarily lost my temper. I think of losing my temper as reverting to ad hominem attacks. I wasn't criticizing her worldview.\n\nYeah, I'm glad you understand.\nI don't know if I necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory. I would say an issue that I have is not being able to remember in as much detail as I would like. I remember feelings and moments, not stories. My life doesn't always sink together into a coherent story. It's like this moment and that moment.\nCould it just be one of the hardest decisions?\nI'm having a hard time recalling a moment where I had to choose between two options. There's no Sophie's Choice type moment in my life. But I do think that the decision to leave New York after having lived there for five years was very difficult. I had to do it for money reasons and because all my core group of friends were leaving and going other places in the world and the one other person I was close to was living with someone who I did not get along with at all. It was either gonna live with people who I wasn't as close with or Craigslist or move home. It was a tough decision to leave. In fact, it was so tough that I had to justify it by saying that I would be moving back to New York within a month or two, which didn't end up happening.\n\nHow hard was that?\nIt was hard. It was isolating. I had fallen in love with one of my closest friends and that had gone extremely badly. So I wasn't on speaking terms with her and everyone on my list of friends who was closer to her. It wasn't quite her or me, but that was the way that I saw it at the time. I was socially isolated.\nWell, recently it's been awful. I like to. Last night I slept for ten and a half hours, which seems to be the length of time that I have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams. But previous to that night, the night before last and the night before that I got four hours and two hours of sleep because I was working on set and I would get back and I just couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason. Too much riled up energy or something.\n\nTired?\nNot immediately. Initially upon waking up, I had really enjoyed being up in the early morning and I also stopped drinking caffeine. I've had a little bit of coffee the last two days, but before the last two days, I hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks. With caffeine in my system, I'm ready to go. Without caffeine, I'm quieter, more introverted.\n\nSince when?\nChanging my thoughts. I mean, I guess when having just moved here, there was a period of time at the beginning where the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people because I moved here because I have a group of friends here or a couple of friends. The push to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first. I think that I'm slowly coming into terms with that and moving past it, but the pressure is still there.\n\nNo.\nThe last time I felt really happy might have to reach back. I think the last time I felt really happy was during the writing process. Last year I shot a movie, co-wrote, co-directed, co-produced. That still consumes my life, but during the writing stages of that movie, we would bunk down, eat breakfast, work really hard, pure creative energy between me and the person writing it. I remember going to bed and I was so thrilled to be working on what I was working on and working with the person I was working with. I felt like it. That was more than a year ago though, but when you're making a movie, you can't allow yourself to be happy, especially if you're doing it by yourself.\n\nI would say that I'm very accepting of other people and always very empathic and open, excited about new ideas and open to new ideas.\nI guess I wish I was less ruled by fear, more fearless in my everyday interactions and in my zest for living.\n\nI think there are numerous instances in my childhood in which my parents were always on the other side of the court. Other parents were like if their kid was in trouble, their kid was perfect. There's something wrong with other people, but my parents were always the opposite. In particularly my mom, so I would say that there are a couple of instances in which I was blamed when what I was doing was.\n\nTen years ago.\nStay stay stay. I think that I have a tendency to get really caught up in an idea and devote myself entirely to it, but sometimes ideas are too easily. Do as much as possible. Don't decide that you are only going to do one thing. Learn to read music. I'd love to learn how to play the drums. I'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more acting classes. It's only now that I.\n\nGoodbye.",
         "Okay, here's my story regarding my experiences with depression:\n\nThings have been rough lately, especially with sleep. I've had nights with only two to four hours of sleep because I was working on set. Then I have trouble falling asleep. I felt a lot of pressure when I first moved to LA, trying to find a job and meet people. It was overwhelming, but I think I'm slowly getting used to it, though the pressure is still there.\n\nIt's hard to remember when I was last truly happy. I think it was during the writing process of a movie I co-wrote, co-directed, and co-produced last year. We had so much creative energy. But when you're making a movie, especially independently, it's hard to allow yourself to be happy. I wish I was less ruled by fear and more fearless in my everyday interactions and zest for living.",

         "This is kind of fun.\n\nAlright. Thank you. Hi, I'm Aria. Thanks for coming in today. Are you okay with this?\nYeah, I'm totally fine. I'm just a little bit nervous.\nThat's good. So, how you doing today?\nI'm doing pretty good. Hanging out. Nice weather. I just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you, the digital you that I'm seeing. It's funny because I've just always thought that the conveying of emotions or feelings be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself.\nThank you.\nI'm from Born and raised in Los Angeles Venice area Marvista specifically. That's where I'm from.\nWell, there's a lot more that I don't like, but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up, that the idea of certain medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent topic, very thought upon, and I feel that Los Angeles' deep culture is why I stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand. The human mentality here is very hectic, very chaotic, a lot due to the vehicle, the car, the freeway, and this idea that we're on a grind. It's a very hectic human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing.\nUm From my travels, it's not like well, I do enjoy a lot of things about travel, but it's more like I enjoy not being trapped in the city with all these made up ties and restraints. I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this faux man-made image that it is here. So I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is.\nThanks. Would you Okay\nWell, I kind of recently last year went to Los Banos Central California area and although it wasn't that far from LA, it was completely different energy. There was no phones. There was no Wi-Fi. There's no TV there was sanity there was relative sanity in the sense that people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chill and I was working at a hot spring resort And I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry. You don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so I just wanted to get out of here and experience the real deal.\nWell Currently I'm studying Physical therapy. I'm about to become licensed massage therapist. But before that I was going to for music composition so I was just writing scores for films animations dance productions theater productions. Yeah, it was cool. It was fun trippy very trippy but I had to leave that because tuition hikes going up to like 50,000 a year for like a four-year BFA is not the deal not trying to trap myself with these chains of federal loans. So yeah\nDream job. Hmm My dream job would be anything that I can do to alleviate these metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they've been put in. My dream is to alleviate the nightmare. My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and with physical therapy and artistic expression, I've got some great ideas. Yeah\nI guess more outgoing. I just like experiencing things so outgoing. Yeah\nI do to relax is just kind of breathe it out chill. Maybe make a smoothie or some tea. I'm gonna go bike riding right\nWell, it wasn't arguing I don't really argue much I just like to save my opinion and have it be understood and I like the person I'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was I guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from New York and we were talking about writing and basically, we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written. Yeah, so yesterday\nThat's tough. I haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt. What about you? What's something you feel guilty about?\nI don't really wish I could erase anything from my memory because then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased, you know butterfly effect kind of like.\nMaybe the time she was going to school, I was taking the year off, and I was just kind of hanging around. But we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn't turn out. Nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it, but this one turned out a little different actually quite different than I thought it would be in I thought it was funny but yeah, it ended up me leaving before the lease ended and it actually ended up yeah with us separating but that's something I wish Maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully.\nHardest decision Hmm Maybe not a hard dissed but a hard decision I had to make was leaving school dropping my continuation of achieving a BFA. Yeah, that could have been the hardest\nI mean, of course money is a big issue tuition hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan to support that but that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around and but another reason why I decided to leave had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because Art Institute, you know, that's a it's a funny idea in itself already and basically I was a musician being taught by a musician to make music and same with you know, all the other dancers or the theater students, you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance, you know, and it's just it's just not quite as artistic as I thought art would be art Comes from somewhere somewhere sweet and deep and purple and not not from out there, you know, so yeah\nIf it's kind of easy I mean it depends, you know if I remember to make some chamomile tea or if I remember to breathe and go through my mantras or remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then I can get into it real nice But if I just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until I remember to breathe. Yeah\nUm, yeah, basically just what I said just breathing or you know If I'm hanging out with friends coming home late, and if I get the lucky chance to be medicated from you know a nice nice indica Then it really does, you know indica does put me down pretty nice Pretty drowsy. So a lot of things breathing, you know, you know medical herbs like chamomile cannabis and just leaving myself of bad bad juju\nI guess not if I can't think of something now I've been feeling kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a gray line But it's a nice gray. It's a really nice hue Some people wouldn't like this, but I really like that and it's stable Yes, it's comfortable.

         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, from my perspective:\n\nI haven't been officially diagnosed with depression, but I believe everyone experiences a range of emotions, including depression, happiness, anger, and shyness. It's just that the intensity and frequency vary from person to person. I definitely feel really happy a lot, like this morning when I was biking in the sun. But I also feel really sad a lot too. Lately, I've been cruising on a \"gray line,\" which is stable and comfortable for me. To cope with difficult feelings, I rely on breathing exercises, chamomile tea, and sometimes cannabis. I try to rid myself of bad energy. If I remember to breathe and follow my routines, I can manage my thoughts. If I get caught up in my thoughts, it takes longer to get back on track.",

         "I've been feeling down lately, mostly because I'm struggling financially and don't have a boyfriend. It's been over two years since I felt truly happy, back when I didn't have money problems. Lately, I've just been feeling more sad than usual. While I haven't been diagnosed with depression, it's been hard. I get frustrated because I'm poor and don't want to be. Leaving home to try for a better life in California was a hard decision, and while I miss home, I try to persevere. I find some comfort in small things, like watching my cats play and sometimes turning on a fish tank screensaver when I feel tense.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just here to talk to people in safe and secure environments. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything, your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes.\nSo, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. That's good. Where are you from originally? Uh, California. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather, I like the people. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. That's primarily it. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Sociology. Really? Yep. How did you decide to do that? It's a topic that just really interested me, the most out of all the other subjects. Are you still working on that? No. What's your dream job? To be a writer. Can you tell me about that? I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in. Like what? Like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. What do you think of today's kids? I think they have it pretty easy. They don't know how easy they have it. Do you travel a lot? No, not really. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing. What do you do to relax? I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing. Or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing like watch TV. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long. Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. Why? Because they basically sort of raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much. I understand. Tell me about a situation that you wish you could erase from your memory. Uh... I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yeah. Yes. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Um... I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Uh... because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision, I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh... my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh... not really super easy. I sort of... I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Uh... normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh... last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends right now? Uh... probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Uh... I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh... no. I don't think. I think regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um... Don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um... Sometimes I can be kind of lazy. I'd like to have more of a sort of better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh... just sort of putting off stuff until you know right when it's due or after it's due things like that. procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh... sometimes for the things that I write, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um... I guess I'm most proud of the fact that I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um... just hanging out with my friends. people watching. Watching a movie that's good. listening to music. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.",

         "Okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? California, here in Los Angeles. Really? Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? I love being near the beach. I love living in a big city. And I love the fact that I have lots of friends and family here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Just so many, sometimes too many people. But apart from that, I'm generally happy here. Okay. What did you study at school? Photography and language studies. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I love photography. I was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well. So I wanted to continue to learn more about it. And with languages, I come from a mixed background. So I wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic background. How hard is that? It wasn't hard. It was a passion. So I enjoyed it. Are you still working on that? I'm not, no. What's your dream job? To do photography full-time, and also to do some of the things that I'm passionate about more creatively. Like what? I have an idea. I'd like to make a robe line. Women's robes and things like that. Awesome. Mm-hmm. Do you travel a lot? I have. I've traveled quite a bit, and I love travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different cultures, different countries, meeting new people, all of that. And the language. What are some of your trips? I lived in Greece for over a year. I taught English there and moved around to different parts of Greece and really had a great time. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think just having my group of friends that I met there and going through the experience with them. I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to Elefonissos in a car with everybody and having just a fantastic time. That sounds like a great situation. Yes, it was. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm shy to begin with, and as I get to know people, then I'm much more outgoing. What do you do to relax? I just stay at home. Maybe watch a movie. Rest in bed. Watching a movie in bed. That's probably one of the things I like to do to relax. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I think very good. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? It was probably with my boyfriend regarding money issues. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now. Can you tell me about that? I'm having some struggles in my career right now. Financially, it's becoming very difficult. I'm sorry. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it has been difficult, but I've been working very hard to remedy that. That's great. Can you give me an example of that? While I'm here, I'm doing this focus study. I'm doing many things to generate more money, working harder, but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my career. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Probably being raped. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Sometimes. Are they triggered by something? Not that I'm aware of. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling stressed and worried. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't seem to have any problem with it. I seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm grumpy and lethargic in the morning. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was probably deciding to not have a child. Can you tell me about that? I was pregnant and wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy. That was also due to financial burden. The father I was involved with did not want the child. I made that very difficult decision. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Really, really happy. I know. When I went to Cancun on a holiday over the New Year period. How did you feel in that moment? I felt absolutely fantastic. I felt happy. I felt relaxed. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world temporarily. Free. That's great. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive. Definitely more assertive. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I would say I'm a wonderful friend. When I love somebody, I love them very deeply. Friends, family, boyfriend. I think that's good. I'm very loyal as a friend. I'm honest. I care about people. I'm fun to be with. I think those are some of my best qualities. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, with my father, is not so great. My parents were divorced when I was young. He's sort of been in and out of my life forever. Mostly out. It's not fantastic, but it's something that I'm used to. It's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then I lost him. It's still not the best situation. I still wish that could be remedied somehow. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. I love her so much. She's been there for me since I was very, very young. She's always been just incredible. I love her so much. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so I don't have to work so hard now. Okay. Is there anything you regret? I regret exactly that. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy. That was probably one of the best times in the last few weeks. Tell me about your kids. They're great kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren. There are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. We're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot. It's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them or overpunish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child. It's really difficult so I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to travel the world and live in many, many other places around the country and around the world. The fact that I've learned several languages and the fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends. Okay. I think I've asked everything on YouTube.

I don't really Get angry or anything like that. I tend to keep it in Or try to release it by writing. Um, I actually can't remember the last time I argued with someone.\nAll the people I've hurt in the past Well, I Like cheated on people Hurt their feelings intentionally Done things I shouldn't have done that I regret now.\nWell with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now I probably shouldn't have argued so much or tried to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out.\nHardest decision I've ever had to make was Man I really don't know actually.\nTell me about your experience or the symptoms you've been most likely to experience.\nTell me about that.\nJust seeing him stuck in bed was just terrible.\nMe and my family aren't very close. We don't I mean they've always been there for me and I appreciate it But we've never had that close connection Especially since they're foreign so they don't really understand where I'm trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it's pretty different when it comes to those racial I mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of step each other each other's feet on But aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other. It does get kind of awkward, but it's okay.\nI Think they are out of control.

They're being applauded by celebrities that they follow And there's not enough being done about it, and they're just getting lost.\nUm depends on the night some nights. It's pretty hard some nights. I fall asleep like a baby. Usually creative actually when I can't sleep. I'll just stay up, and I'll write something or I read a book and ideas will pop up.\nLately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I'm energized and I'm alive And then some not some days when I'm just you know just sitting there Just mellow thinking Not like my live self I don't know. It's just always been like that always have those ups and those downs, but they kind of balance each other out.\nNo.\nNo.\nThe last time I felt really happy was Hmm today Just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day I Went to see you some friends. We had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers Wrote a good essay feel pretty accomplished, and I feel like my day is just a good day.\nMy best friend would describe me as odd most people would describe me as odd I Say a lot of odd things I do odd things I'm interested in things that most people aren't Um just like old literature Revolutionary stuff stuff about changing the world, but through underground means.\nUm no, I don't live a life of regret.\nTo never let fear stop you from doing anything.\nReading just hanging out with some friends driving around finding something to do just go on an adventure.\nI Don't wish I could change anything about myself. I just wish I could build myself into the person that I'm truly supposed to be.\nUm this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and She pointed out all the things I've done that I shouldn't have done all at one time how I've hurt people how I've hurt her The ways I've done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all.\nMy parents I Mean although we don't see eye to eye that always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day Although I never listen to them or I don't choose to listen to them Once it happens I learned from it and I'm like, oh, that's what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learned to Understand that they are wiser than me and that they do know more than me.\nI'm not so much anymore. I travel around LA try to find new sites to see but as far as I don't travel outside I'm discovering new things discovering things you never knew were there or the limitless possibilities I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures New things that go against what's normal for us and for myself.\nA Few days ago, I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert I had to offer and it was just enjoyable I felt free away from all this These cities and these buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time felt good.\nI'm most proud that I've always been different That despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird or I'm odd or I think weird things I've always maintained my original mentality.\nYou",

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions as a starter. Your answers are fully appreciated. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing really good. That's good. Where are you from or is your home? I'm from Granada Hills, California. It's the San Fernando Valley, part of Los Angeles. Cool. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. I like the diversity in people. I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's not just one race or kind of food. I love the beaches. All the activities you could go do. Theme parks, aquariums, stuff like that. Museums. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The smog. There's a lot of creepy guys. Do you travel a lot? I've pretty much traveled around LA. I've been cross-country back three times. Twice was when I was 17. Wow. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live. I'd love to know the only place. When I was 17, I ran away with my boyfriend to upstate New York to Watertown. It was like a Navy Army kind of town. We had an apartment there. It snowed a lot. We sold antiques for a living. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Getting passes, press passes for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through a friend. Getting to meet rock stars and hang out at the private parties. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm very outgoing. I love people. What do you do to relax? I go to the gym and work out quite a bit. It helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going. I notice if I don't work out a couple days, I feel a little more tired than normal. It just helps me feel good. How are you at Conflict? I'm pretty good at it. I'm very calm. I've worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm. They're the customers, so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid because of the money they're spending. I'm good at resolving consumer conflicts and stuff on the job. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people. I started getting loud just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean. I wonder if you're talking to people like that, they might not like it and they could attack you or something. You never know. It is LA. That sucks. What's something you feel guilty about? I really don't feel guilty about anything, decisions I've made in my life. I think I've made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass, what I'm doing. I grew up in church, so I haven't gone in years, but I still have those values and the rules, the 10 Commandments and stuff in my head. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called the proper authorities and followed through on a court case instead of letting him bully me out because it wasn't up to code. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. A few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from. After a few months, he was coming to LA and going back home. I decided to move there and I had just started this business I was doing, event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there on the East Coast and it didn't work out. It was tough deciding, should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experience something new or stay in what I was doing. What did you study at school? I had a degree in dental assisting, I did that for a year, I didn't like it. Then I was studying communications, radio and television broadcasting and journalism. Are you still working on it? I'm doing event work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I'm trying to get a website going and have where I'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of writing for someone else. How did you decide to do that? I always wanted to write and was always into the news and music and art growing up. I really liked Connie Chung, she was like a channel 4 newscaster in the 80s and I loved Barbara Walters. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My sister, she doesn't talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom. I never really knew my dad, it doesn't bother me. I have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so I don't really talk to them on phone, we just communicate on Facebook or Twitter. How easy is it for you to go to sleep? Oh, I go right to sleep. When I get tired I just go to sleep. How is it for you? Pretty good, energetic, I've been motivated to go look for more event work, event planning stuff and really grinding it more than I was. How hard is that? I mean it's kind of hard because you've got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I mean I'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone I know dies. I wouldn't say that I'm just super like, oh my god, happy all the time but it's like an even keel that I feel pretty good all the time. What would you say are some of your best friends? I'm very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them at ease and I could adapt to different situations and even if it's not my scene or situation or a group of people that I'm used to, I could still jump in, talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I want to make more money. Me too. Tell me about a time when someone knew you were really bad and knew about yourself. I remember in like second grade, people used to make fun of me because I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A's, one of the highest grades in the class, so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or stuff like that. How would your best friend describe you? Very talkative. She would just say that I talk to everyone. And that I'm very friendly and if you need help, that I'll help someone, you know. Tell me about something you've been doing recently that you really enjoy. Recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I've known years and we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like took him to the park and played and it was really nice and it was cool visiting her. I hadn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again. I like the area. What's something you feel close to about? I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more, like for my business instead of working for other people. I think I pursue it, but I think maybe I could put a little more time and day into it. I see. Tell me about maybe that or something maybe where you feel like it's coming from. I don't really know anything like that I want to erase or not happen. Okay. Is that what you mean by that? No, I feel good about my choices I've made and I think I'm on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do, the balls rolling and I'm getting things done. I'm not as big as I want to be, but I feel like I'm on my way there. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Like 10 years ago I would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as I was. My friend we call Mojo. Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball I'm rolling. He's one of the biggest people in my life telling me you're talented, you could do it. He's just a really good motivation for me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm going to get to that point. Great, thanks.",

         "You're saying right this is So let's just want to say one thing real quick here too late I Just want to say okay. I miss my recall isn't that good I don't know what the time I did with her last time because when I went back there I think they asked me questions like recall questions from this so I should try to be aware of like How I'm answering of which things about her Okay, all right, oh I see okay, I got you okay Well what she said no, okay, okay, I got you then all right. Thank you\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and we'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. My answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today? Doing okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from LA. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. I like the sports teams. I like the entertainment. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's pretty much the same year-round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad. You don't get to get all four seasons, so it's kind of like a mixed bag. I guess maybe I'm kind of used to it by now, so it would be nice to explore other areas. I've lived here all my life, haven't done too much traveling, so it's a little bit of a ruddiness to it. But overall it's okay. Okay. What did you study at school? I took computer programming and operations, but that's going back to the 70s. What made you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? No, I kind of phased out. I still use computers, but I haven't been in programming for a long time. Why? Well, I kind of got into another area, kind of a diversion to another area in my life. This is going back to the late 70s. I kind of took another turn, and by the time I got back into it, I kind of got into another field. So I never really pursued it to the degree that I wanted to. What's your dream job? Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? What do you need to do to relax? I watch music. I watch TV. What do I do to relax? I just try to avoid stressful situations, so I kind of stay relaxed. I also talk to my friends, too. I'll be around an area, kind of a comfort area, where I feel safe. I can just dialogue with people. I'm not really worried about my own problems. I'm just focused on being in the moment with my friends and acquaintances. How are you at consoling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really have a temper problem. It takes a lot to get me to explode. In my younger days, I think I had a slight bit of temper. I never had a really bad temper, but temper is not really an issue I have. I tend to be pretty mellow, easy-going. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Wow, that's a good question. I'm not sure, to be honest. I didn't think about that for a long time. To be honest, I can't come up with an answer on that. It's not really part of my repertoire. Nothing comes to mind off the top of my head. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I don't really have too much family left. The only one I have is just me and my uncle. We communicate on a regular basis. He lives in Clearwater, Florida. We're okay. He's in his 80s, and I'm in my 50s. We have small talk. He's concerned about my well-being, but it's on a shallow level. We don't get really deep. He's got his own problems, so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation. Other than him, there's not really anybody else I have. It probably makes me a little bit depressed because I don't really feel I have anybody I can really count on or really confide in. How have you been feeling lately? Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Have you been diagnosed with depression? Why? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Let me think about that a minute. Actually, it wasn't that long ago. I helped out a lady at a trade show. It was at Anaheim Natural Products Expo. It was pretty nice. We had some nice meals afterwards. There were a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples. It was in Anaheim, so I got a chance to get away from LA. I met some interesting people. They were very outgoing. They were willing to have me experience their product or service. I was around people that I worked with who I got to socialize with. I think I was pretty happy back then. That was about a month ago. That sounds like a great situation. How would your best friend describe you? What would you say of some of your best colleagues? Is there anything you regret? What comes to your mind? What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I was going with other people's opinion, other people's advice. I was going away from my basic beingness, the way I really felt. For example, I would do aggressive investing, which if it turned out good, I would have been well off for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, it went the opposite way. I regretted going with my gut feeling and letting other people influence me. By nature, I'm a conservative person, so I should do more conservative investments. In other areas of my life, I tend to be more conservative, but I made some aggressive financial decisions. That always goes back to that area as far as what I regret. Tell me how you spend your weekend. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. I'll see you next time. Did you do one with her before you did this? You can take your headset off now. You can go back there. You're going to finish up with a quick survey about your experience. You're going to start by pressing this button. You're going to keep going until you hit the next big stop sign, and then you're going to press this button to let us know you're done. We really value feedback so you can take care of your answers.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, based on the interview, written from my perspective:\n\nI don't have much family left, just my uncle in Florida.

         "Okay, no, I was just wondering if she doesn't look like anything like the actual person. Yeah, like a virtual reality thing. Okay. So how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York. Really? When did you move to LA? Oh, I moved to LA in the 70s, but I lived a lot of different places. Um, I guess every few years, but I travel a lot, so I've lived in Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Hong Kong, too. Different cultures, food, music, rituals, everything, the smells, the colors, makes you feel alive. Excuse me, one of my trips, oh, I lived in Kenya for about a year, I'd say. I love horseback riding, so when you're viewing other animals, when you're kind of disguised in the scent of a horse, you can approach the animals a lot closer. So it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along, you know, seeing so many animals. Yeah, in Kenya. Um, probably when I went to a Messiah village, and I happened to, I used to live in Hawaii and I had been to Tahiti and I was wearing one of those perraus that are hand painted and I had it tied over the left shoulder with a twisted or not. And I happened to enter a Messiah village for the first time that day and I looked all around and the men were wearing their clothing exactly with the same twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed Messiah? And then they came back and gave me what appeared to be uh some very large what looked like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have like weighed my ears straight down and um and then then it gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist and they said now you look proper Messiah. So, but I you know, I just I have a lot of uh I think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world I just uh you feel like you're alive all your senses are completely you know uh awoken. Yeah. I think it's not so clear cut. I think a lot of peoples are a hybrid of both. I mean, I think I can be extremely shy sometimes, but extremely brazen uh and very courageous at other times. Probably one of my best virtues is I'm very gutsy person. So when I really feel passionate about something, I risk everything to go achieve it sometimes. Um, I believe that um usually well I make decisions very quickly and I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how I could make decisions quicker and I told him I said well in each case you always have no choice and he says what do you mean there's hundreds of choices and I said not really because it's gut wise there's only one and it doesn't really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when gut wise you always know what the choice you really want to do is and it doesn't matter whether there's a 98 chance of failure even if it's a two percent chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield you joy so I always go to that it's it's to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another choice because who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn't yields no joy. What do you do to relax? Pardon? You said you put your fish in when you're annoyed. What do I do when I'm annoyed? I think when I'm annoyed sometimes like it's because sometimes I can have I need to be a little more patient I guess you really have to put yourself in somebody else's shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy. How hard is that? Not really. I think that's the reason why I enjoy traveling so much because you're put in other situations where you're forced to to understand other people's lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from yours different situations I've been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that it helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is. When was the last time you argued with someone and won? Let me think. Last time I argued about something I'm trying to remember. Oh, I think it's when somebody didn't respect actually my privacy in something. Can you tell me about that? Oh I know what it was it was somebody who belonged to the Scientology faith. I inherited possibly an immune disorder from my mother. My mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I have like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photosensitive and I had an episode where I had big flare up and I wasn't really feeling well and I was I was very flushing and everything and the Scientologist tells me that I needed to be audited and he said something about are you aware of past lives and I had told him that I was Buddhist and I was kind of curious that if you're going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed to be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware that about something in your past and I go yes I believe that many religions including Buddhism and Scientology believe that things that you have had in your history sometimes affect you or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents and such can affect and make you feel better make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe I said that you know that you have the power of each person has a godlike or a buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when I'm on the verge of possibly being I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years I don't have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it is I think when I think I'm on the verge I take sort of like and I did this even when I was a child when I was seven I would fall down I have my boo boo and I would take I would say I would have the good part you know help the bad part from a simplistic way in terms of a child and I would actually even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I concentrated healing and when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that you did her last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but I was just I think annoyed and irritated only because the Scientologist told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had these certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn't even a matter I said of whether he was whether he took 20 40 courses or whether I've been practicing Buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years or whether somebody been practicing some type of Christianity for 50 years and been sitting in a church pew every day it doesn't mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so I just was thinking that is the antithesis of somebody who says they were enlightened but it's just the way I guess he kept going cramming his you know his faith down my throat that after a while I was pretty patient with it but then it was so pompous that I became irritated especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet this same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn't point it out to him because I just didn't even want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip because you need to be audited that something that you did in your past that you didn't want to do. So he had this idea of this person getting audited completely and I found my thought he should really read up if he's trying to convert other people from other religions so but, you know, I just didn't, you know, care for the fact that he wouldn't drop it. But other than that, I mean, I don't. Sometimes to have a little more tact, I guess, when in terms of patience. I can think of that right away. I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital. How did you decide to do that? My brother was supposed to be the strong one supposedly because he is in the medical field. So my sister and I said, well, you know, he's the medical one. So he's probably used to seeing this all the time. But it turns out he was the weakest one. And even after, you know, my father kept, you know, bucking these, body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and all kinds of things. You see all this jerking of body movements and stuff. It was just very hard. But, you know, as after a while, the, you know, even the physicians and even the pastor from that particular, you know, hospital, they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that, his brain function would have been, you know, negligible. Yeah. That sounds very hard. Yeah, it was. Tell me about that or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Hmm. I don't think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I've had to block them, I really don't know what it is within my makeup, which doesn't make me feel like I need to. I don't keep I have friends that have unmitigated issues, which they're not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger or their hatred or their fear. And for some reason, I feel blessed that I don't really I can't really even think of something that I mean, I've had some bad situations happen to me, but it's not that for some reason they've traumatized me and affecting, you know, my behavior, where I would where I block it, that I'm not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason. So I really can't think of anything. I mean, there's bad things that happen and I know that there, but it's not like I feel like it's necessary for me to block them because I've been able to, you know. Except sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened. OK. How easy is it for you to make a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I can usually make myself sleep in any situation. If I have a one hour flight to San Francisco, I could just kind of lean against the window with a pillow, have the blanket over and even an hour flight pass out before the plane is even taken off from the ground. So I can I have literally when I've had little sleep and I very high energy. So I don't really need that much sleep. But say, like if I'm in Africa in a. Bumpy potholes, unpaved road, and I suddenly decide I need a few moments of sleep, I will just prop something up, put my elbow against the window and say, I think I'm going to take a nap for 15 minutes ago like this and through the jostling, I could just take a nap for 15 minutes. So I don't really have that problem. OK, pretty OK. I mean, I could deal without the skin flare ups, but, you know, from the photosensitivity and all that. But other than that, I'm pretty good spirits. Have I ever studied what? I've never studied using a behavior. I still couldn't hear you, I'm sorry. I've never studied changes in my behavior. What was the word? Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Uh-uh. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, I don't know, just with friends and everything, just even this past week, just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having a great meal, laughing, just, you know, having a good time, listening to music. Regret about my entire life, you mean, or are you talking about just recently or what are you talking about? You know, it's funny, I find that a lot of the negative experiences that have happened in my life have also been opened up experiences that are also great that I have not overlooked. For example, I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my whole savings that I've had to start all over again. And sometimes people say to me, like, are you sure you're OK? Are you just pretending to be OK? Or are you angry? Do you want to seek revenge? If I was, you know, because my business partner essentially ripped me off. We knew each other's families, which was even more difficult in a way. And he stole essentially my whole life savings, essentially, in a way. And he got sent to prison. The FBI was involved. Interpol was involved. I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth. And. But, you know, if I hadn't get involved, I hadn't gotten involved with him in business, I wouldn't have had a lot of rich experiences. And I think sometimes the reason why. I don't know why I'm such a positive person, but for some reason I'm able to. It's not that I'm purposely trying to. I do see the positiveness in even a horrible situations. I wouldn't have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich. I wouldn't have learned to speak as good Spanish. German lived in in Europe if I had not got involved in business with my business partner, who ended up ripping me off. But and there's a lot of other experiences and different friendships that I developed during that period of time. And in a way, it was a total different life, a different world that that would, you know, that I would have never had the chance to live through if I had not been involved in my. But of course, it cost me financially. And but then again, I've always been a type of person who, you know, money is in everything. And I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it. So there you go. And for example, what are my favorite? Times in my life, probably when I lived in Kenya, and you would think that, you know, a lot of people have this really bad vision that I may be looking living in mud dung huts or something and living very primitively. I mean, it's not like that at all. But and you'd think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that, I mean, actually, and I really didn't have, you know, that much mean many material goods at the time. I mean, I had the blast. I had probably the one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya. The same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16. To live your life with passion. And again, like choose the way I was saying earlier about making decisions. You have to make those decisions gut wise. What will give you a sense of awe and wonderment? What will make you give you joy? And you have to it's regardless of what the percentages are, even if you only have a one percent chance of success, you have to go to that because that's the only thing that will yield, you know, the happiness in your life. Mm hmm. The fact that I've adhered to that and been brazen, whatever you want to say, have the balls, the chutzpah, the kahanist to go ahead and follow my passions. And, you know, I guess people call them sometimes strong decisions, usually decisions that are when you where you remain unscathed, usually don't yield joy. That's just Murphy's law. That's just the way it is. OK, I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Bye. Bye. Hi. Hi.",

Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes. I'm doing okay.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nI'm from Greenwich, Connecticut.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhen did you move to LA?\nI moved here in 2008, so about five years ago.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI try to go back at least once a year. Sometimes I go more, sometimes less.\nHow does it compare to LA?\nOverall, I think I like where I'm from better than LA in general.\nWhy?\nI think that other than it being somewhere I'm familiar with, the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I'm used to and less superficial.\nI understand. Why did you move to LA?\nI moved out here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California.\nHow easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?\nInitially, it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience, so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once. But then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here, it became more difficult than originally.\nWhat's your study at school?\nFine Arts and Photography.\nThat sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?\nI was interested in photography since high school. I did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments. So I decided to pursue art.\nAre you still working on that?\nYes, I have a fine arts degree that I got last year.\nAwesome. Are you happy to do that?\nYeah, I really enjoy working or interning in forensics. I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography. I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nThat's an interesting question. I guess just my childhood in general, growing up.\nCan you tell me about that?\nWell, my family is very close, my extended family as well, and most of them live within the area or on the east coast in general. So we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that.\nThat sounds like a great situation.\nYeah, it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible, which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nI consider myself more shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI watch reality television. I think it's kind of funny and lighthearted.\nLike what?\nI watch like Bravo TV, like the Real Housewives shows, and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to.\nOkay. How are you at controlling your temper?\nI'm good, I guess. I don't really have like a temper. If I'm more stressed out, it definitely shows in my attitude, but I don't really have like anger.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nWhen me and my boyfriend bicker all the time just like about like insignificant things. But other than that, I had an argument with my dad a few days ago.\nCan you tell me about that?\nThere's been like some tension going on since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter, things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her, although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. So for like the 30th time, we were on the phone and he was telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I had told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend because of the Jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very immature and telling me, oh, forget it, she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like I could care less because I don't care about having a relationship with her. So she doesn't want to hear from me, you know, it's easier for me.\nYeah, that sucks. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nI mean, it's been the same recurring argument a lot and I wish that I could, sometimes I do, but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue. But the thing is, is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me. So I kind of just like lose it and I can't really like not say anything.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nWell, I guess the hardest decision I made, which I didn't only realize that it's the hardest decision, like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college, because for me, I basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. So it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time. It felt like just like a progression of the next step. But looking back now, that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made.\nOK. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nWell, I wish I could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral, which obviously it wouldn't change anything. But it wasn't seeing her there was not something I'd want to like have in my memory.\nThere's someone that's been a positive influence on you.\nShe was. She was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental. And now, I mean, my parents are great role models just in general. I mean, they're very successful people. So whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people, they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nUsually it's easy. The problem is staying asleep no matter how late I go to bed, whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m. I will be up like clockwork by 730 or 8 o'clock in the morning, the latest every single day. And I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer.\nAre you triggered by something?\nNo, I just in the morning, I guess I'm a lighter sleeper, but I just wake up like I just cannot stay asleep anymore, which never used to be a problem this consistent. But now it's I cannot remember the last time I slept past 830 in the morning.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well?\nI mean, it just makes if I have to do stuff during the day, it makes it a lot more tiring. But it doesn't really. I'm so used to it now. It doesn't really change my mood. It's just part of every day.\nOK. How have you been feeling lately?\nUm, I don't know. I kind of just feel very like so so just no extreme highs, no extreme lows. It's kind of one note land. I mean, nothing like lately. Um, like recently, it's just I would say over a period of years, I've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing.\nNo, I have been diagnosed with anxiety. I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital because I thought it was more serious because I couldn't breathe. But they said that it was a little bit more serious. So I had to go to the hospital. I think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it, if they're open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing. Then, yeah, no, I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid. I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me. But it was never so I mean, we just sat around and talked about my day. It wasn't I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time. So I didn't really get much out of it.\nWell, I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday. When I'm there, I can always just we save up our money. So it's a complete vacation. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. I just every morning we wake up, we just go to the doctor. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. So we wake up, we hang out, just enjoy the day.\nThat's great. Is there anything you regret?\nIn general?\nYeah. I regret the college I chose to go to. I didn't be from the East Coast. The whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently. The universities out there are not the same as the tight-knit California school system out here. So when I was researching colleges, I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general college, just like Boston College back home or any other school with the name college at the end of it. I didn't realize until the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school. I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went. So it kind of created more problems for me.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nWell, considering I'm 22, I'd probably say 10 years ago, I would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California.\nHow would your best friend describe you?\nMy best friend would describe me as a great, charismatic, funny, outgoing, socially enjoyable person, which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me, which I mean, I don't, I mean, it is what it is. I am very outgoing and have a great time when I'm with my friends in my element. But around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things, I just, I am very shy and don't really speak much.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nRecently, my friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago, and I really enjoyed that.\nNice. Yeah. What would you say are some of your best qualities?\nUm, I'm very caring. I am a very good judge of character, which I mean, I guess, I mean, I consider it to be a quality for myself. I'm very, I mean, not very affectionate. I'm more, I mean, I guess, I guess so.\nOkay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.\nThanks. I can chat with you a little bit more about.",
         "Okay, here is a summary of the interviewee's experiences with depression, written from the first-person perspective:\n\nLately, I've been feeling very \"so-so\" – no extreme highs or lows, just kind of one-note. Over the past few years, I’ve become more secluded and reserved. I was diagnosed with anxiety after experiencing some breathing problems and going to the hospital. While I believe therapy can be helpful in the right setting, my childhood experiences with it weren't beneficial. One of the happiest times I can remember recently was when I was at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday because I didn't have to worry about responsibilities. I also have trouble sleeping, waking up early no matter when I go to bed, but I'm used to it now and it doesn't really change my mood. ",

         "Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? So, how are you doing today?\nThat's good.\nWhere are you from originally?\nReally?\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nDo you travel a lot?\nI do. I go to school in Chicago. And I've been to New York a couple times. San Francisco. And I took a road trip across the country. That was cool. I saw a couple states.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nSeeing new places. Going to landmarks that I've only read about or seen pictures of.\nI'd love to hear about one of your trips.\nI traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66. And the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen, probably.\nAwesome. How did you feel in that moment?\nHappy. And then just happy. It was beautiful. It was nice. I haven't felt like that in a long time.\nWhat's your dream job?\nI love making movies. But part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera. So a comedian, a comedic actor would be totally great. But that's hard.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nI am super outgoing. And I love talking to people a lot. I like being the center of attention. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI like to watch mindless television. Like Toddlers and Tiaras and Duck Dynasty. I like to watch TV programs where I don't have to pay attention at all.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nI'm okay at it. I get really emotional really fast. But I'm usually able to keep my anger down and not lash out at others and stuff, for the most part.\nHas that gotten you in trouble?\nSometimes I get into arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily. And I hate apologizing to people, so the fights could last pretty long.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nMy best friend Ryan, I think. And it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and how we were going to go back to the way it was before.\nHow hard is that?\nReally hard. He's my best friend and I miss him. But we messed up and it's just not the same. It's like not the same friendship.\nI'm sorry.\nMe too.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nToo many. I guess... When I have a boyfriend and he's a girlfriend, which was not okay, I wish I would have just realized that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks, which led to my breakup and then our friendship being really messed up.\nCould you have done anything to avoid it?\nI guess not spend as much time with him as I did. Being more assertive.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nI guess... It was in November. I was very depressed and suicidal. So I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER. And from the ER I had the choice to, I don't know, I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital. And even though I felt like I didn't have a choice, I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital, which was like the worst experience of my life ever.\nCan you tell me about that?\nUm, it was awful. It was in Chicago and it was scary. I didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices. There were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old. And it was scary. I didn't know anyone, everyone. Most of the people there weren't depressed, they were violent. So that was pretty scary and I just, it was really hard for me.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nI had been so depressed for like a month. I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work. I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turning in any work and I wasn't talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and I was just in a really bad place. And when I finally was going to kill myself, I realized I needed help. It was. I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time. So I figured I don't want to go down that bad path again. I just want to get better. So I had to do it. I had to get help.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful?\nI feel like if you have the right therapist, it's really useful. I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far, but sadly she's back in Chicago and I'm in Los Angeles. So I have to make do with this new therapist. She's okay. We're not that great together, but she's who I have right now. It's better than nothing.\nWhy?\nEver since I got out of the hospital and I began medication for my depression, I just haven't been able to sleep well. Falling asleep is hard. Staying asleep is hard. Have really crazy, vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing. I guess just sometimes they reflect things that I'm worried about or happening in my life, but they're just they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom, like, did we go here? Did we do this? Did this really happen? And it's usually, no, you dream that. Sometimes I've gotten so scared. I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up. Probably like two nights ago.\nTell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nI guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends. Maybe going home with them and bake some cookies, eat all the cookies, watch some TV, have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies. We watch a lot of movies.\nI would like to do my free time.\nGo for a walk. I don't know. Go to the beach.\nIt was nice to meet you. Bye.",
         "Okay, so I've struggled with depression, especially recently. Last November, I was in a really bad place – skipping classes, failing school, isolating myself from friends, and drinking heavily. I was even suicidal. It got to the point where I knew I needed help and told a friend I needed to go to the ER. I chose to go to a mental hospital in Chicago, which was honestly the worst experience of my life. It was scary and isolating. I started medication after I got out, but now I have trouble sleeping and have really disturbing dreams. I had severe depression as a younger teenager and tried to kill myself then and got put in therapy for quite some time. I do think therapy can be helpful if you find the right therapist. I had one I really connected with, but she's back in Chicago. My current therapist is okay, but it's better than nothing.",

         "Okay. Yeah. Gotcha. Cool. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just curious about the people in the space and the way they're doing. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I love hearing about you. I'll ask you to get to the space first. And please feel free to come in and have a look at the answers to our questions and comments. Can you agree with this? Sure.\nSo, how are you doing today? I'm doing good. How are you?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? Chicago.\nReally? Yeah. When did you move to LA? About 25 years ago.\nOkay. Yeah, it's been a while. How often do you go back there? Actually, I haven't been back. I like LA.\nHow does it compare to LA? It's a big city, so it's kind of similar, but the weather is not the same. So, gotta love LA for the weather.\nI didn't know that. Why did you move to LA? Family. I was a child.\nHow was music for you that you used to live in LA? It took a little adjustment, but not hard.\nThat's good. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather... I can't think of anything right off the bat, but I sure wouldn't want to leave. My family is here, so that's another reason why I wouldn't want to leave.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really, but I've traveled a little bit, yeah.\nWhat are you enjoying about traveling? Seeing new places, different people, the way they live their lives. Cool. I'd love to hear about your friends. I went to Monterey, California, in the middle of last year. That was very nice.\nWhat's one thing you're most familiar with? That's a good question. I'm not really sure. I can't think of anything right off the bat, which makes me think it's kind of weird.\nWhat did you study at school? Astronomy.\nWas that a good student? How did you decide to do that? I don't know. I just kind of fell into it. I took a course, liked it, and then took some more, and kind of just went down that path.\nAre you still working on that? No.\nWhy? There's not much job opportunities, so it's kind of limited.\nDoes it help? Yeah, it does.\nWhat's your dream job? My dream job? I would like to own a restaurant, a nice bar restaurant.\nCan you tell me about that? I'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to. At least in the area that I live in, most places don't seem very, kind of just seem like a dive bar, or just kind of worn out, run down. Something nice, something different, something creative, something vibrant, something that attracts a crowd. But it's probably costly, so I don't know if it's really plausible.\nDo you consider yourself a shy or outgoing? I'm definitely more shy, but I can be outgoing when I'm comfortable with people, but initially I'm pretty shy.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fist and scream safer. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. Good idea. What do you do to relax? A lot of times I try to just lay back and do some deep breathing, just kind of clear your mind. Or maybe just watch a movie. Listening to music is good. Reading a book kind of just takes your mind away. Relax.\nHow are you at completing things? I've gotten much better at it. I used to have problems with that when I was younger, but I'm good with that now. I've learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations. You should think before you speak, that type of thing.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? My ex-girlfriend, when we broke up about three months ago.\nCan you tell me about that? How did you feel when you broke up? How do you feel about a situation that makes you a different person?\nOkay, I think I've asked everything you need. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Have a good day. Goodbye. Hey, that was weird. I felt like I was in therapy. Should I take this off? Okay.",

I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I love learning about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to come in if you don't mind. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you OK with this? Yes.\nSo how are you doing today? I'm OK.\nWhere are you from originally? I was born in Mississippi.\nReally? Yes.\nWhen did you move to LA? When I was 2 and 1 half years old. But actually it wasn't in LA, it was Santa Monica.\nYou were very young working there. Yes.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown? Never.\nWhy? I was only 2 and 1 half years old. I don't remember anything.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? Oh, I like the beach. I love all the restaurants. The music scene. Just a general excitement. Oh, and the parks and all that.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic. The maintenance on the streets. All the potholes. The pollution.\nWhat did you study at school? Well, I studied a number of things at school. At one point I had majored in public relations, journalism, specialization in journalism. Then I also studied... I was a pre-law major. I studied the law. Then I also studied human services courses.\nThat sounds interesting. What made you decide to do that? Mainly because I'm a people person and I enjoy helping people.\nWhat's your dream job? I don't really have one right now.\nDo you travel a lot? No, I don't.\nWhat do you do to relax? Um, listen to music, watch horror movies. I love horror flicks. And I have a Fish Tank too, so I like to watch my fish. I also like to play tennis when I can. I haven't been able to play lately though because of physical problems.\nCan you tell me about that? Um, it's just that I had injured my ankle because I had anemia. And I got dizzy one night and I fell on my ankle and on my leg. So I'm just waiting for that to really heal. But I'm planning on getting back into tennis. It's one of the things I enjoy doing. It really relaxes me.\nHow are you at controlling your temper? I really don't have a temper. Over the years, I've learned how to control that.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? What were you about? Probably would have been yesterday, but there was no argument.\nAnd what was it about? Nothing. But I can recall.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about? Something I feel guilty about? There's nothing right now that I feel guilty about.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The absolute hardest decision that I ever had to make was when my, I have twins, twin boys, they're grown now. I had twins, twin teenagers, and I had lost my job and we were living in a motel. And the rent for the motel was outrageous. I couldn't no longer continue to pay the type of money that they wanted. So I had to briefly put my son in foster care for a minute. That was the hardest decision that I had to make.\nTell me about your kids. What was your first impression of your son? He was schizophrenic. And he had had, he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with speech therapists and school officials. And he also lost his hair when he was four years old. Um, but, and then when he turned 14, the schizophrenia came up. So right now he's in a supportive living environment. He's 27 years old. But he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now. I had problems in the past because he didn't want to take the medication and give him the medication and he'd hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever. So, but he's come to terms with that and we've all come to terms with that. He's doing, he's doing pretty good. That son, he's 27 too, as I said, because he's a twin, was living in Texas with his wife and he got a promotion to, so now he's in California too. Both are in California. I feel very good about that.\nDo you find it easy to be a parent? Um, well, of grown children, yes. No, I take that back. It's not hard to be a parent of my grown children. When they were younger, there were difficult times, and there were a lot of good times too, but yeah, there were some difficult times.\nCan you tell me more about that? Well, the difficult times I really pretty much already alluded to when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and they were in, temporarily in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia.\nWhat's the hardest thing about being a parent? At this point in my life, there's nothing hard about it.\nWhat's the best thing about being a parent? I don't know, I guess it's just to see something that you created develop into a pretty decent human being, a decent person. That's the best thing.\nWhat are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Oh, a lot of ways. I didn't have two parents. I had a mother and the father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I had no contact with him. But the thing that I do differently than what my mother did, she was a strong disciplinarian, both verbally and physically. Um, and she had this tendency, which she outgrew, to be very critical, opinionated, and very religious, and sort of looked at people who were not, and that was me, as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the Bible and all that kind of thing.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't get a good night's sleep or I don't sleep at all unless I take medication and that's all there is to it. If I don't take medication, I don't sleep. I'll be up all night. I will be up for days if I don't take medication.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? Man, irritable, and tired.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Lately, you know, just a little anxious really. I just recently made a move to a new apartment and it's a lot of expenses and new expenses and things like that, and new furniture and new this and that that you have to get. But I managed to do all that, but the whole thing was kind of stressful.\nDo you always pay off some of your art bills? Yes.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not PTSD.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Yes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed with that? That was back in, I think, 2004.\nWhat got you to see health? Because my life had gotten so stressful to the point where it was either I had to do something or end something, to tell you the truth.\nDo you still get a therapy now? Yes.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful? Yeah, I think it's useful as a good sounding board, someone to throw your concerns out and discuss things that might be bothering you. Well, good things too. Yeah, I think therapy with medication.\nWhat sort of changes have you noticed since you've been here? Since I've been going to therapy, a lot of changes, I've been more focused, more hopeful, it's just been a little bit of a struggle but it's just been a good experience for me which is why I continue to go.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy. Really happy? Well, I can feel really happy by some occurrence. I can't think of anything right now just like that and then I go back to how I was feeling. So I can't really pinpoint anything really. I mean, if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time, that makes me happy. If things go right, how about that?\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something I did recently that I really enjoyed. I can't think of anything.\nHow would your best friend describe you? I don't have a best friend.\nWhat would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities are that I'm an honest person. I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt. Everyone in my book is as they appear to be until they prove it differently. I'm very generous, overly generous. And I like to help other people. I mean, help on a personal level. I help people with anything, whatever their problem is, it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out.\nIs there anything you regret? Anything I regret? How so? Whatever comes to your mind? There's only one thing I regret, and that is that after my twins became old enough to start going to school, at the elementary school level, I was taking some courses as a pre-law major, and at that time I was married to their father who turned out not to be a good fit for me. And because of the stresses involved with him, knowing that that was going to end and I was going to leave him, I dropped out of college. So that was my biggest regret.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay in school, no matter what. Stay the course, no matter what.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life? That I'm a good person. That I'm a good human being. That's all.\nI think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye.\nAre you done? Okay. That was weird. I was a little nervous. Yeah? Well, we'll have you fill in a survey about your experience and then afterwards you may continue.",
         "In 2004, I was diagnosed with depression. My life had become so stressful that I felt like I had to do something, or things would end badly. I currently attend therapy, and I find it useful as a sounding board. I feel that therapy, along with medication, has been helpful. Since starting therapy, I've noticed changes in myself. I feel more focused and more hopeful, even though it's been a bit of a struggle. I also have trouble sleeping and need medication to get any rest. When I don’t sleep well, I become irritable and tired.",

         "All right. Great. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes, that's fine.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm okay. How are you?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally?\nOriginally, I'm from San Francisco.\nReally? When did you move to LA?\nOriginally, I moved here in, gosh, 1995. Then I went to Chicago, then to San Francisco, and then back to Los Angeles probably about five years ago.\nWow. A lot of moving. How often do you go back to your hometown?\nNever.\nWhy?\nThere just isn't anything there for me anymore.\nI understand. How does it compare to LA?\nThe weather is better in LA, but the people in San Francisco are nicer.\nYeah. Why is it different to LA?\nMy husband, my ex-husband, prefers it here. That's why we moved.\nOkay. What did you study at school?\nI have an undergraduate degree in psychology, and after that I went to law school.\nThat sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?\nWhen I was in college, I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer. It was really interesting. Are you still working at that?\nNo. Now I'm a stay-at-home mom. Tell me about your kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo. I love it, but it is difficult. You have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person. What's the hardest thing about being a parent?\nIt's easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that. I'm good at that. The hardest thing, I think, is to guide them emotionally, to help him through things that he's having a hard time with, feeling like I don't have all the answers. What's the best thing about being a parent?\nJust seeing them grow and experience new things and learn about life and the world. It's really, really cool. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents?\nCompletely different. I am not a perfect parent, but I love my son. I take care of him. He's the first priority in my life, and they weren't like that at all. Tell me about your relationship with your family.\nWell, my parents are dead. I didn't speak to my dad at all before he died. I have a sister and a brother that actually, I don't know where they are. I don't speak to them either.\nOkay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nProbably more shy because I consider myself more reserved. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii. It's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI like to listen to music.\nLike what?\nI listen to all sorts of music, but my favorite when I'm relaxing is 80s music. Cheesy, cheesy, but true. How are you at controlling your temper?\nIt depends on who I'm with. If I'm with my son, I can control my temper. If I'm with my ex-husband or other adults, yeah, I don't. So-so. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about?\nYesterday. It was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married. Can you tell me about that?\nUm, I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he's continuing to date her. That sounds really hard.\nYeah. How did you feel in that moment?\nUm, really angry and just really hurt.\nYeah. I'm sorry. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nUm, I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died. I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nThe hardest decision I've ever had to make was actually ending my marriage.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nBecause he was cheating on me. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nUm, that would have to be, well, I don't know. I mean, I don't know if I'd want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today. So I can't really think of one event that I would want to erase.\nI see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nI don't get a good night's sleep. It's not easy. I wake up a lot in the night.\nWhy?\nI don't know. I wish I knew. If I knew, I could change it. I could try to do something about it, but I just don't, I don't know. What are you like when you don't sleep well?\nUm, grumpy, irritable. How have you been feeling lately?\nGrumpy, irritable, um, down, mixed with anger. Can you tell me about that?\nIt's just because of everything that I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband. What do you have with them?\nUm, I just keep it inside. I mean, there's nothing else to really do except, I mean, it is what it is. So I have to deal with it. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nYes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nTen years ago after my son was born.\nWhat got you to see the health?\nNine years ago. I felt like I couldn't cope with life. I was so down. I couldn't, I felt like I couldn't do anything. Are you triggered by something?\nNo.\nDo you still go to therapy now?\nI don't go to therapy. I go to medication management. But I don't do talk therapy. Is going to a therapist helping you?\nI have gone to therapists and no, they don't help. Can you tell me about that?\nUm, well, some just sit and stare at you and don't say anything. If I wanted to talk to myself, I would. Others give advice that I think is just not good and not on point. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nIt was probably this morning I was playing with my son.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nJust really happy. I wasn't thinking about any of the other crap in my life. I could just forget it. So I was feeling really, really happy. How would your best friend describe you?\nI think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me. I think they would describe me as really sweet because they have really sweet, confident, outgoing, because that's what I try to be to people. So I think that's how they would describe me. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nI wish I wasn't sad. I wish I was more confident. Is there anything you regret?\nYeah, there are a lot of things, I think. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nIt would be to not give my life over to one particular person, which is what I did with my husband. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nI think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son, hanging around the pool, having fun, going out to dinner. Is there someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nTwo of my friends, two really good girlfriends, I think have been really positive influences in my life. Can you tell me about that?\nHer life is worse than mine, but we can always commiserate together. She's just really positive. She's always happy, always up, always looking to the bright side. That's so good to hear. What are you most proud of in your life? Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nI went over to a friend's house and we had movie night. We watched a grown-up movie and had dinner and wine. The boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games. It was just a relaxed, fun evening. That sounds like a great situation. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nSure. Bye.",
         "Okay, here's my story regarding my experiences with depression:\n\nI was diagnosed with depression about ten years ago, a year after my son was born. I sought help because I felt like I couldn't cope with life; I was so down and felt incapable of doing anything. I don't go to talk therapy anymore because I haven't found it helpful. Some therapists just sit there silently, and others give advice that I don't find useful. I am on medication management though. Lately, I've been feeling grumpy, irritable, down, and angry, mainly because of everything I'm going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband. I wish I wasn't sad, and I wish I was more confident. I also don’t sleep well and wake up a lot during the night, which makes me even grumpier.",

         "Okay. Yes. I'm alright. South LA. The weather. The women. The opportunities. That's about it. Racism. Police brutality. Injustice. That's it. No. Not much of a exploring type of person. Psychology. It was one of the classes I excelled in the most. So I decided to change it from business to psychology. Yeah, yes. No. It's on my own record label. How hard is that? Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? Why? I'm not. What do you do to relax? Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best it's got. That's good. How are you at controlling your hunger? I think I'm pretty decent now compared to how I used to be. Is that something you're controlling? Yes, ma'am. Can you tell me about that? Due to the lack of, I guess you could say, controlling my emotions, I have got incarcerated and sent to prison. Yeah. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever made to make. I'm not sure. I don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision I've ever made in my life. When was the last time you argued with someone and argued it out? It was probably a few days ago with the girl I was talking to and I was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness. How did you feel around her? Frustrated. Because you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship. And at the same time when you have expectations, sometimes you kind of set yourself up for failure. I guess I'm just learning. Tell me about a situation that you would have handled differently. There are a lot of situations I would have handled differently. Probably the most recent was I got into a physical altercation with an inmate when I was incarcerated. And that's what sent me to prison and I had to do a lot more time. And if I handled it differently, I probably would have never went to prison. I probably would have been home a lot sooner than what originally happened. Tell me about events or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. There are several events I wish I could erase from my memory. Probably my first girlfriend. She did something really extreme. It wasn't necessary in my eyes. And it could have cost me my life. I think that's a recurring thought that I wish I could completely erase my memory, along with the good memories as well. A few fights. I guess you could say shootouts. Getting jumped, getting robbed. Those things I think those inhibit me, I guess, to explore certain areas of life that I'm not comfortable with. So those are the few things that would be nice if I could erase it completely. What's something you feel guilty about? Hurting people I didn't need to be hurt emotionally, especially a few women in my life or in my past. Probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through, along with my close friends and family as well. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It used to be rocky growing up. But as I got older and matured and the certain experiences that I've been through kind of brought me closer to my family. So now it's pretty decent. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? My mother. Can you tell me about that? She had her share of experiences, negative and positive. I admire her. The struggles she's been through. She experienced difficult economic hardships growing up, but that didn't stop her from raising a son at a young age, finishing school, getting her masters, and just overall being a good person. And she also battled mental health issues as well. Okay, I think I've asked everything you need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. You can have a look at your computer. We'll finish up with a post survey about your experience.",
         "Okay, so, looking back on things, I think a big part of my struggles comes from not being able to control my emotions. It led to me getting incarcerated and doing time in prison. There are definitely things I wish I could erase from my memory, like what happened with my first girlfriend – it was a really bad situation that could have cost me my life. Also, some of the fights and violence I've been through still affect me; they make me afraid to explore new things. I also feel guilty about hurting people emotionally, especially women in my past, and putting my mom through tough times. But, you know, my mom has been a huge positive influence. She went through so much, including her own battles with mental health, and still managed to raise me and build a good life.",

How long have you been back to Florida? I haven't been back in a few months. How did you get into Florida? It was pretty easy. It's not that much of a difference except I guess the buildings are bigger. What do you like about Florida? I like the weather and I like the environment of Hollywood, I guess. What do you hate about the city? I hate the transportation system and the traffic, it's really bad. I'm sure you can tell from the screen, you're not missing the road. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, I've traveled a lot around America. What do you like about America? I like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff. I guess it's just relaxing and it's fun. What was your favorite place to visit? I went to Canada once. My mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there. I didn't like the cold. What was your favorite food? What did you like about that particular trip? She made us this Canadian food called poutine or something. That was a new experience. Sometimes when I'm doing something, I come up with a new experience. Hey, sometimes not a lot, but it's a precious time. What do you do when you're relaxing? I try to get out in the sun and go to the beach or something or read a book. I'm pretty okay. It depends on how bad the situation is. Two days ago, I was arguing with my sister about something. What was your favorite thing to do? I don't know. I guess think more before I talk and maybe I won't lose my temper. What was your favorite thing to do? Something I wish I could erase from my memory. I guess negative people that I've met before. I guess I just want to erase the thought of meeting them. What was your hardest decision? The hardest decision I've had to make. I don't know. I guess what I wanted to study in college maybe. It's not that hard, but it's a big decision. What did you study? Computer science. Are you still working on it? Yeah, a little bit. Not as much, but a little bit. How did you get into it? I got into it when I was a teenager. I was good at it. I figured I'd go on studying at a higher level. Are you still working on it? Yeah, somewhat. I was trying to make a decision between that and the arts. I'm just happy I did it though. What did you dream about? A dream job? A fashion designer. How hard is it? How hard is the job? I don't think it's a hard job. I like clothes and fabric and making clothes like that. I don't think it's a hard job. How do you sleep? I fall asleep within five minutes, depending on how tired I am. What do you do when you're tired? I'm very irritable. I'm very irritable and not good to be around when I'm tired. And I can't focus. How do you feel about your job? I've been feeling good. Fine. Have you ever been in a relationship? No. How did you get the last time you felt really happy? The last time I felt really happy... I guess like a week or so ago I went to... I went to... There we go. I went to this event downtown. It was like an art walk thing, so it was exciting. Awesome. Thanks. What do you think about your job? I think I'm a good friend. I think I'm hardworking. And... what else? Yeah, that's it. Do you regret anything? Um... Do you think I regret? Not really. Well yeah, I regret not contacting old friends that I knew. So I guess maybe I'll do that in the future. How do you know them? I know them from elementary school. But we lost contact through the years. Because I switched schools. How do you guys spend your time? Really badly, you know? Um... I can't think of it. I guess I was in... I was in an elevator one time and this person was running towards it. And I was trying to hold it for them, but I couldn't reach in time and they started cursing me out. So I felt really bad because they probably thought I didn't try to open it for them. But yeah. It was sad. How do you guys spend your time? For now? Okay. Um... I don't know, I guess I would just say... Um... Learn as much as I can and... I don't know, just don't hold back so much. With like um... Like not being outgoing and stuff, I guess I just tell myself to be more outgoing. How do you guys spend your time? Um... I think they'd say the same thing I said earlier. That I'm generous, patient, hardworking, and... What else did I say? Um... Kind? I hope they'd say that. How do you feel about being an intellectual? Um... I am proud of my intelligence. Okay. Okay, bye. Take care. Bye. That was weird.",

And it's not that I like it, but that's just where my parents were, so that's where I grew up. Nothing, that's right there, I love LA. Maybe that is ghetto, but that's about it. I was thinking of going for sound engineer or mechanic, but I'm not sure. Because my dad, he used to do that. I'm not even sure to be honest. I really thought about it.\n\nI can look at your shoes.\nNah, I don't travel like that. I don't know, maybe money issue or something. I have a lot of money, I go all over the world.\n\nProbably outgoing. Depends I guess. About what? Shy or outgoing? Outgoing, you could be outgoing at a party, you know. You're already out there, so you can be shy if you're going to a party.\n\nI'm good. Probably my girlfriend, because I miss work, because I just feel lazy. I was like, whatever, I just didn't want to go and I do what I want. I just didn't go.\n\nNah, not really. She's already there. As long as we have the bills and rent paid. Don't worry.\n\nGuilty. Probably nothing. I'm not sure if I'm going to work. Damn, I get raised from that. Probably bad friends that I've met. Friends that trick you, that just trick you. Friends that deceive you, I guess. Okay, like my friend told me that he had a good job at some car wash place. So he told me to, he's going to get me hired there and get me a direct deposit. But then he ended up actually going into my account and taking money from my account. So...\n\nProbably moving out and into my mom's house. Yeah, I haven't really been around, man. Like a big decision like that. I want my own space, my own life. I want to do what I want. Come home when I want, leave when I want. Yeah. And we're all close. We hardly argue. We're always around. We always see each other. My mom, my dad, my brother.\n\nHow they were positive in my life?\nWell, they're always there for you. Whether you have financial problems, they're there. They help you out. Whether you're sad, they know it and they blame what's wrong. They're always there to motivate you and keep you going.\n\nHow easy was it to move out?\nEasy. Actually, yeah, pretty easy.\n\nWhen did you learn about the U.S.?\nI'm sorry?\n\nWhen did you learn about the U.S.?\nI haven't noticed, but maybe... Probably the same. I don't think sleep does affect you, but I don't know. Maybe more tired, but I don't think annoyed or mad or anything like that.\n\nHow do you feel about the U.S.?\nGood. Everything's great. Maybe that I want to start a new business or something.\n\nDo you have a new business?\nWell, like my dad, he wasn't around for a while, but he just got back. He actually opened up a shop and he's getting a lot of customers. So it seems that his business is growing, so I'm probably going to learn mechanics, like I was saying earlier. That's cool.\n\nHave you ever been by the pool?\nI don't even know what it is.\n\nHave you been by the pool?\nNo.\n\nHave you played games?\nNope.\n\nHow do you love your basketball?\nI'm sorry?\n\nHow do you love your basketball?\nYesterday, last night, because I got a new game. Awesome.\n\nWhat do you say when you hear a comment?\nThat not funny?\n\nDo you have a new girlfriend?\nNo.\n\nWhat are some things you would like to change about your life?\nI don't think nothing. Everything's fine, you know. Thank God everything's good right now. I don't think there's nothing to change like that.\n\nWhat kind of job?\nMaybe a better job. Well, first of all, I don't even have a job. So I guess to change I'll get a job. It's hard for someone to put me down like that.\n\nDo you see a part of that I'm responsible as well?\nI don't know.\n\nShe was components of 20 years ago when I gave that one almost nine years, because she was having hard time paying bills and rents. So I, I'm proud that I was able to help her even though I could only give so little.

         "Okay. Here's the cleaned transcript:\n\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just creative to talk to people and think into their environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started, and please feel free to comment on anything. Your answers are very important. Are you okay with this?\nYes, I am.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing very good today.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nI'm originally from Chicago, Illinois. Moved out here when I was three.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI never go back.\nWhy?\nFamily issues. I see. How does it compare to LA life?\nIt depends on what you're into. If you're into the fast life in Hollywood, it doesn't compare at all. If you're into the cold weather, then you would rather be out there. I like the sun.\nMm-hmm. What's the difference?\nMy mom and my dad split up.\nI'm sorry.\nIt's okay. How easy was it for you to move to the US?\nI have no idea. I was only three when I moved out here.\nOkay. What are some things you really like about LA?\nI like the sunshine. I like the weather. I like the balance of the weather we have in the spring, winter, fall, and the summer. I like the beaches. I like Hollywood. I like that the Lakers are here. I love the people. It's a different variety. I think LA is a microcosm of the United States. People from all over the world come to the United States and people from all over the country and all over the world. They come to LA for a better opportunity. That's what I like about LA.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nGang violence.\nHi, Mr. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nNo, not really. I've traveled one time to Arizona and one time to Stockton, California, and another time to Barstow, California, but I don't do much traveling right now, mainly because of finances.\nWhat did you study at school?\nI studied alcohol and drug counseling.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nI just felt it in my heart that that's what I was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions. That was a kind of easy choice. I got some advice from people and I just went into it to do it just to see what it was. I finished school and did an internship and got hired. I believe that's what I'm supposed to be doing with my life.\nAre you still working on that?\nI'm not working right now. I actually moved away and I was married and we had to move away. We moved away because renting was cheaper, so I actually had to give up that job in order to make that move. Since I came back down, I've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so I can get back into counseling.\nHow hard is that?\nIt can be very difficult at times because I have a felony. I can't work with the youth and I can't work with the elderly, but the regular adults, I can. Then you have to be certified and I'm not certified yet. You have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified. Before they even allow you to take the test, you have to work a certain amount of hours. Right now I'm just trying to get into interns, try to intern and show people what I can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume. They just want people to be certified. Not being certified, the experience and the fact that I have a felony makes it hard.\nWhat's your dream job?\nMy dream job is to open my own facility or as an author.\nDo you consider yourself a shy or a felon?\nThat depends on people. I mainly adapt my personality to the people that I'm around. If people are perky, then I'm going to be perky. If they're standoffish, then I may seem shy, but I'm not shy. I'm just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up. If people open up right away, then I open up right away. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's a trusted guy.\nWhat do you do to relax?\nI mainly listen to music or I watch YouTube, write poetry, or just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like I can sing, which I can't. Another thing I do is I eat ice cream.\nTell me about controlling your temper.\nControlling my temper, I'm very, very good at it. It depends on what it is. I have to say that the last time I lost my temper was because I felt like somebody was scaring my mother. I lost my temper, but 99 times out of 100, I don't lose my temper. I don't like to raise my voice. I just like to be calm and cool. I like everybody to be comfortable. I don't want anybody to be frightened or anything. There's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it. I just believe that, and I believe angry outbursts to be a link to heart problems and high blood pressure. I definitely don't want that.\nTell me about a situation that you were seeing in a different way.\nWell, I was just telling you about, it was my mother's husband. To tell you the truth, I could have handled that differently, but when I seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear, I just lost it. I snapped. I told my mother, I don't like this. You need to take care of this because I don't know how long I can keep my composure as far as this. I've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother, but that's her husband. I kept my distance in their relationship, but when I saw her having fear in her eyes, that triggered a part of me that I don't like very much because I know if I get angry, I usually stay angry for a long time. So I should have just left. I should have just left and went home and rested and got up in the next morning and went to church. But yeah, we had a big time explosion and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months. So yeah, those six to nine months, I can't get back. That's very hard.\nYes. Tell me about your relationship with your family.\nWell, my brother's in prison. I haven't seen him in 20 years. He's been there 20 years. My sister moved to Chicago 13 years ago. I haven't seen her since then. So I'm only close to my mother. And my son, I haven't seen him in five years and I'm still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and how that's going to turn out for me. I just, you know, I have a small family and I have family in Chicago, but I don't mess around with that side of the family just because of what I've seen and heard. So I just don't want it to happen to me at all. So I just keep my distance.\nIs there someone who's been a positive influence in your life?\nSomeone who's been a positive influence in my life, I would say... Taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me expressing my emotions, being threatening to someone else. And taught me how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are. And when they're really strong, that's when I just need to be quiet until that intense fizzling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not just emotionally. And of course, he's he was the one that told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor. My father, he's got 27 years clean and sober right now. He used to live on Skid Row and the way he changed his life around and, you know, the way he approached me as a father was just something that I'll never forget.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about?\nFeel guilty about? My grandfather. He passed away in 2004 and at that time I was just getting out of prison. 2002 I was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't going to be around for that much longer. But I didn't get it because I had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that I considered to be more important than that. Plus the fact I didn't understand him, what he was saying. But when he died, I figured out that he was telling me that I should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go. But I couldn't see it then. And I feel I think about it all the time.\nOkay. Tell me about home or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nSomething I could erase from my memory? What made a day my brother hit my mom? I always replay that over and over in my mind. And it's like that's one memory I can just go without replaying my mind over and over again. So yeah, that memory right there.\nHow did you feel about that memory?\nI felt conflicting feelings. Because on one hand, my brother was protecting me from getting beat. And on the other hand, he was hitting my mom. So it's kind of in the middle.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nMost nights I don't. I go to sleep maybe three in the morning. And I'm probably I'm more than likely up at seven in the morning. So I don't get much sleep. It depends on the environment I'm in. If I don't sleep well. I'm going eventually I'm going to be irritable, but it doesn't happen right away. It depends on my environment and who's around me. If they're difficult people, that's going to be a challenge for me. And if people are easy going, no one will even know that I didn't get much sleep.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI've just been feeling like that things are about to start going better for me. Making some better decisions. Taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me. Taking advantage of my talents. Taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me. So I'm very enthusiastic about that. Even if it doesn't happen, I'll send out a million resumes. I don't care if I get five interviews. I will never stop because I know that being a counselor is my life mission. And I'm also destined to be a writer. And it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people know about me because I've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that. And I have a lot to offer humanity. So it's just a matter of time before that the public is exposed to what I've been gathering.\nHow do you understand that you're using your behavior in front of people?\nMy behavior? I'm more mellow. I laugh more. I'm more humorous. I let a lot of things go that I used to just let tick me off and anger me. And things that I can't control, like trying to control people or trying to make sure people don't betray me. And you just can't control that. I matured mentally and psychologically. And the acquisition of a sense of humor was a major, major breakthrough for me. So I know my thoughts have changed. And with my thoughts changing, my behavior has changed. I still have to monitor it. My thoughts and my behavior, I still have to monitor them. But overall, back then I just tolerated myself. Now I actually like myself. And it will behoo you to feel the same way.\nOkay. Have you ever been diagnosed with dysplasia?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nLast time I felt happy was last night because the Lakers won the basketball game.\nAwesome. How do your best friends describe you?\nMy best friend would describe me, he calls me the truth.\nWhy?\nBecause I always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and I always reveal it. They can't hide it from me. I have a statement that says I see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it. And I see stuff days and months before they start happening. I know human behavior when I see it and I sniff it out real well. And it's just a gift that was given to me. So he calls me the truth because of how I interact with people and how people have to come clean with me. Because when they look at me, they know that I see through them. Like I said, like a clear glass with nothing in it. And yes, that's why he calls me the truth.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nI wish I would have never, well, obviously I wish I would have never went to prison. I wish that I could change, well, my economic status, my employment status, and my teeth. That's like a problem area for me. I did a lot of stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and I didn't take care of my teeth. And now that I need to be confident about myself as I can be, it always comes up every now and then, the thought, like, I wonder if they're looking at my teeth. I wonder if they're looking at my teeth. I never get the impression that they are, but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says, are they looking at my teeth? So I would really change that. And I would change my physical size. I think I would like to be at least 35 pounds heavier, but I'm working on it. 20 years ago, which would make me 18, I would have, at that time I was a big time high school basketball player for Freedman High School and I had colleges coming to see me and I would have given myself the opportunity to stay away from the troublemakers because I didn't and I blew my opportunity to play college basketball for Duke Blue Devils and who knows, I could have been playing for the Lakers last night. But, hey.\nI'm most proud of what?\nI'm most proud of my mom. Really. She graduated from school. She had a full-time job. She would wake up at 5 in the morning, go to work, get off her job at 3.30, go straight to the college, leave the college at 9 o'clock at night. She does this five days a week and still had the strength to maintain. She was on the Dean's List and the President's List, so doing all of this, you know, when they say that older people can't do things, I just think that dispels that rumor. And she recently got her license as an evangelist in the church, so I'm just real proud of that. Her life has been affecting people in a positive way. So, yeah, my mom.\nOkay, thank you. Goodbye. Okay, thank you.",
         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I often struggle to get a good night's sleep, usually going to bed around 3 AM and waking up at 7 AM. This lack of sleep can make me irritable, especially if I'm in a difficult environment. I also have a memory of my brother hitting my mom that replays in my mind often, and it brings up conflicting feelings. I wish I could erase it.",

         "Okay, that looks good. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing fine.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nMexico.\nReally? When did you move to LA?\nWhen I was young, seven years old.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI've been there like three or four times for vacation.\nHow does it compare to LA?\nWell, it's less stressful. I don't know if it's because I'm on vacation, but I feel more at peace over there than here.\nWhy did you move to LA?\nWell, my family moved down here for a better life. That was my parents.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nJust the weather and different things that you could do. You could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains. Different variety of things to do.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic. Yeah, basically the traffic. That's one of the main things.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nNot that much. I've been to New York and Mexico only.\nCool. What do you enjoy about traveling?\nJust seeing new places and finding new locations. Something new.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? Like for a trip?\nYeah. Well, I've been to Mexico. I've been to the pyramids of what I forgot to call Mexico City. I like finding out about my ancient culture since I'm Mexican. From my genetics, I like to see different things like that.\nThat's great. What did you study at school?\nWell, at school, I did dropout but I came back and I'm trying to get back into it right now. I'm trying to learn graphic design.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nWell, I started liking to take pictures, doing different things. I like going into business. I like what the title is about.\nWhat's your dream job?\nI want to have my own business. Either making web pages, just be able to be free and don't be relying on someone else. Just be able to have freedom for myself.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nOutgoing.\nWhy?\nI just like to be around people, like to get to know people, depending on the person and how I feel around them.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI like to hear music or do different things like play sports or do different things just to unwind.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nWell, I'm getting better at it.\nWhat was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about?\nWell, it was like two days ago. It was something about I needed to pay a bill or something that I had taken care of. But the person, he's more picky about it. He knows how girls are. They want everything right there and then. I have a handle. I have everything there. And they're just bugging. Sometimes they don't give you the space that you need to resolve something.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nWell, I felt like I was overwhelmed. I already had it resolved. I just was waiting for a check. It's not on my control, but I already had made the proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it. It's like you're making an argument, a storm in a glass of water.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nWell, differently, there's a couple of them, but not so recently because I've been more trying to get my life together. But the decisions I made before in the past, I dropped out of school and doing other different things.\nWhat's something you feel guilty about?\nGuilty? Not that much because not really. Not that I can think right off the top of my head.\nOkay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nThe hardest decision? It's just not on top of my head right now.\nOkay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nAn event? Well, the only things that I remember is when I blacked out or different things like that that I don't remember. But nothing like a particular, only when my brothers died and different things like that.\nCan you tell me about that?\nWell, my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble. And it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much, get into it.\nOkay. Tell me about your relationship with your family.\nNo, I'm Hispanic. I like to be with my family. And I like to go over there to Mexico too. I have a half sister and my grandpa died. He was over there in Mexico. So I like to have a good relationship with my family.\nThat's good. Who's son of it's been a positive influence in your life?\nWell, my mom and dad, they always work hard. They always done what they have to do to pay the bills. That's why sometimes I'd be like, you know, running around trying to get everything done, but done correctly, not trying to take the easy way out.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's a little hard because they're, especially here in Los Angeles, there's a lot of different things that you could get into that's not that positive. And it's hard to stay focused on, you know, the correct stuff.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nWell, normally I just knock out. It's not that hard. It's like, it takes me like half an hour or 15 minutes. But sometimes I can't even wake up even with the alarm. They have to wake me up. You know, my girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on. It's like so hard. You know, I just knock out.\nWhat are you like when you're dusting off?\nI do get a little, either I'm angry or I don't feel good and I don't feel with energy. But I still have to know, I know I have to do something, so I still go through with it.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI've been, well, I've been feeling good, you know, doing a little restless, but not that much. I have to do stuff, so I just, you know, put myself to do it no matter how I feel.\nHave you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?\nNo, nothing out of the ordinary.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nThe last time I felt happy, that was probably on the weekend that I was, you know, going out with, going out to have some fun and, you know, I was drinking and just relaxing and winding down.\nAwesome. Mm-hmm. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nMy ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home, just relax. But nothing else, you know, just be able to relax and unwind with her, you know, either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home, but without getting any calls or any interruptions. You know, just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything and just be with her doing other different things.\nYeah. Mm-hmm. How are your best friends around you?\nLike an outgoing guy, you know, very social, but at the same time I'm reserved depending how I feel with people. I have to, you know, build trust or feel comfortable with them.\nUh-huh. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nWell, I'm changing a lot, you know, like my temper and different things, drinking things. I'm changing a lot of different things so I could get more different things done.\nTell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself.\nWell, there's several, but mostly is when I'm coming from Mexico that they want to demean you even down there. It feels like silly because I went to a store, I was regularly dressed, and I was telling them I wanted to buy something, and then they said that I wasn't belong there. And as soon as they saw my credit card, they kind of changed perspective because they saw the Wells Fargo logo, they know it was American. But they thought it was like, you know, it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place, you have the money, you ask for something, you can ask for something because you have it, not just to kill their time. Just because they saw a logo of a card, that's how they, you know, it just, it was ridiculous for me.\nI understand. Is there anything you regret?\nNo.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nBasically, to stay more focused on different things, stay in school, and, you know, don't go, you know, try to control my temper and do different things. Because if I knew what I know now, back then, it would be different.\nHmm. What are you most proud of in your life?\nWell, I did drop out, but I did go back to school and, you know, I did get my high school. And right now I'm in the process of doing other different things. So right now it's getting my high school, getting that together. And right now I'm working to another goal and trying to get, you know, my, either going back to school. So basically getting back to school and finishing the high school, the GED.\nThat's so good to hear. Mm-hmm. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nOkay. You're welcome. Bye.\nOkay. Stop the recordings.\nMm-hmm. I feel like that works like I thought it would.",
         "Okay, here’s a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective:\n\nI haven't been diagnosed with depression. When asked, I said I have not been diagnosed with depression. I've been feeling good lately, though a little restless, but I push myself to do things anyway. I don’t think I’ve experienced any changes in my behavior or thoughts lately. I do get angry or feel bad and without energy when I don't get enough sleep, but I still push myself to do what I need to do. The last time I felt really happy was on the weekend when I went out to have fun, drink, relax and unwind.",

         "Okay. So once again, when she says that, I'm going to go ahead.\n...for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue to provide for them comfortably.\nWhat did you study at school?\nI studied communications actually. I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now I'm studying business.\nWhat made you decide to do that?\nI just thought that you know there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs and then I have a desire to go to graduate school so I just figured in the long run it would put me in a better position, give me more opportunities with the communications. It's a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of TV reporting and things like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so I just thought I would go into something more realistic and you know but I like both fields. I really do. I like communicating, writing, reading, talking as you can tell and so we'll see.\nWhat's your dream job?\nA couple probably but I would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer, going to different destinations, trying different foods out, writing about different people, cultures, learning and living you know about those different people and cultures living amongst the people there and being interactive with the children and stuff like that so I kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor, social worker, something in that area. If I could encompass all three hopefully I can. I would like to do that.\nThat's actually a hard question probably because I initially grew up very shy and I'm not so much shy as I am reserved now but not conservative but just reserved and you know when I go somewhere I'm checking everything, everybody else out and then once I become comfortable or acclimate to a situation then I'm like okay you know I warm up to the situation or the people but I'm also friendly. I can be very friendly and outgoing. I like to talk. You know I seem like a chatterbox but I'm not really so usually if I'm in a big space with a whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention. I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but overall I am an open friendly person.\nFor me it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything, all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating, praying or reading a good spiritual scripture. If I'm able to I like to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, you know things that will I kind of like the physical part of it. I like massages, things that really release tension. And if not then just like I said just sitting at home reading and praying or I like the beach. I love the beach so sometimes I drive and go sit by the beach. I also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani-pedi or maybe go window shopping. You know things like that.\nPretty good. Sometimes I'm just like I don't really have so much issue with the temper as I am. I just I'm more impatient. Unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so I just can become really irritated or irritable, quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me and just lose patience. Outside of that I'm actually pretty good. I try to be very conscious of where I'm at and be very patient with people especially if I can see that the person is like if they're a new checkout person at the counter or cashier I do try to be patient and understanding because I would want that you know if it were me I would want someone to extend that to me. You know with my kids sometimes you know it works both ways too. If it's that time of the month I'm just like just leave me alone or I might have a short temper or a short fuse. So I am conscious of it. I try to be aware of it and try to monitor it but you know like anybody I'm human in their times or I have my days or moments when I could just like go off and just lose it.\nWhat was the last time you argued with someone?\nUm well I haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been an ongoing thing with American Express. So I would say because it was not a personal contact but a company I we it really was an argument but you know I had some issues with American Express I had to call in about on I think Saturday and I kept I wasn't getting the response I expected and so I would the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and I was upset and you know the rep was trying to over talk me and then I was trying to over talk her. So you know I don't know if you would consider that an argument but I would definitely say that's the last time when you know I just kind of like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning. That one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nProbably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express. Actually it was on Sunday. Yeah and I know the person was trying to help me but you know when you're constantly being told different things and I've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved. It just takes you there. So just I kept raising my voice said some things I shouldn't have and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact. I like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there. My blood pressure was raised. Excuse me. And that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that. Just irritable and agitated and upset. And so I always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how I could you know handle things differently. But that's one I definitely wish I could have kept my cool and been more level headed and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite.\nOkay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nHmm. Well I probably have had a couple but probably the most is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and I was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time. And he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time. And I wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby. But he put me under so much stress and you know kind of I want to say really pushed me into having terminating the pregnancy. And that's always stayed with me and I've always missed that pregnancy that child I think about that that baby or what could have been. I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it. But I know deep down I secretly if I had it to do all over again I would have just I would have kept the baby and move forward. So that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally. I could deal with a lot and I have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know a lot of financial problems. But that to me was the hardest.\nThank you.\nNo. No.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nOkay you know I was laid off in December so I've been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet. So that's been a little tough. I've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school. So my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place about five years ago. Well she's been able to move forward and going with her life and now she's graduating in next month from USC with her master's in social work. So I'm feeling a little envious of that and I have been for like the past year but more so recently although I'm very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it. But you know of course you've done a lot of what she was me so that too has kind of been bothering me. Hi Ms. Lola.\nWhat would you say are some of your best qualities?\nWell I'm really good with people. I communicate well. I like to talk. I'm really good with children. That's why I would like to teach or be a counselor. Although I have not really tapped into it I know I'm a very creative person. I know I write pretty good. I could possibly be a creative writer but I know I'm very creative. So if given the opportunity I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills. Something like with maybe songwriting, fiction writing, probably like interior decorating. Anything artistic. Just anything because I love music. I love the arts. I love drama. I love plays. I'm not a big fashion buff but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that. So I think those are my strong points as well as just getting along with people. I know I will make a great counselor. My friends come to me all the time. I have a good ear for listening. I'm a great mediator and I know how to because I've been through a lot. One of my friends called me the voice of reason. The one that's actually graduating from SC. I know I'm light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom. I don't know if it has to do with having older parents myself or how I grew up. I had very traditional southern parents who instilled a lot of great values in me. Or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign, I'm a Pisces. I'm really good with people. Just period. Like I said, I have my moments but I know if it's something I could go into and develop, I would do well.\nIs there anything you regret?\nNot really. Some of the situations. I wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children. Picked a different partner. I say that because my son's father is great. A great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me. We're not together. I'm just saying overall. I think I would say, if I could let me backtrack that, not finishing school when I should have. Not following my dreams and goals and doing things as I was planning initially. I think that would be the one thing I could say I regret. Not following my goals and finishing school on time and pursuing what I really wanted to do.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nStay focused and finish school. Pick a career path and stay on that. Stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nI think I'm pretty stable and consistent. Overall, how I face adversity. How I face things. I'm a pretty committed person. If I say I'm going to do something, I try to stick to it. I'm a very loyal friend. I've done a pretty good job with raising my kids.\nSo long. Great. Thank you. Bye bye.",
         "Looking back, there have been periods where I really struggled. After being laid off, facing child support issues, and trying to juggle school and job hunting, my emotions were all over the place. I felt envious of a friend who was graduating with her Master's, knowing I wanted to be where she was. The hardest decision I ever made was years ago, when I was pressured into terminating a pregnancy. That has always stayed with me, and I still think about that child. While I've faced a lot of challenges, that remains the most emotionally difficult thing I've gone through.",

         "Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get it started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Okay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm wonderful. How are you?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally?\nCalifornia.\nReally?\nYes.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA?\nThe weather is one of them. The food and the way everything is centrally located.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic, the smog, and it's just gotten really overcrowded.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nI wouldn't say a lot, but I do try to travel at least once or twice every two years.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nJust exploring different things and being able to have different experiences, things of that nature, and learning new things and just different cultures. I like to learn about different cultures, and when you travel, you get a sense of feedback from different cultures and different areas. So I like that. I'd love to hear about your trips.\nI just came from Miami last year. I went to Miami for a week and a half. It was really nice. The weather was great. It was my first time going. The weather was wonderful. The people were really nice. It was really a great experience. I went out there for a particular event. They have something every year where everyone comes out from all over. You just kind of party and hang out and meet new people. It was really fun.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nFrom that trip, I would say swimming in the beautiful Miami beach waters. It was wonderful.\nThat sounds like a great situation.\nYeah, it was.\nWhat did you study at school?\nChild development.\nThat sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?\nWell, I've always been interested in children since I was younger. I babysat a lot, so I had a lot of experience with kids at a young age. As I grew older, I realized that it was something that I liked to do. That's when I looked into child development courses. I thought that it was something that I would enjoy doing. I started taking classes, and the rest is history.\nAre you still working on that?\nI am, yes. It's been 15 years in August.\nWow. What's your dream job?\nMy dream job? I would say to become a principal.\nWhy?\nWell, it's something that I've thought about doing for a while now. I've actually just began the steps to try to get that going. I'm going to be back in school, and I'm going to be taking courses so that I can make that happen, because it is a dream of mine.\nThank you. How hard is that?\nIt's going to be pretty difficult. There is several years of schooling that I have ahead of me. It's definitely going to be a challenge, but it's something that I'm up for because it is a dream job of mine. It's something that I'm willing to do.\nI understand. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing?\nA little bit of both, I think. I can be shy at times, and outgoing as well.\nOkay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI meditate. I'm a big meditator, so I love meditating. I love reading and having a nice, quiet, peaceful time.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nOh, wow. I'm very good at that. Again, a series of meditations that I do, it involves deep breathing and just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heartbeat, and you can really feel everything in your body.\nThat's good. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nIt's about just the way he responds sometimes to me. It can be a little aggressive. We're just trying to work with that because I don't respond well to aggression. I totally tune out, and that's actually what happened. Yeah, that was it.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nI felt very frustrated, and I actually felt angered too, but more frustrated. I felt saddened too because I don't like arguing, so it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nA situation which I wish I would have handled differently. Honestly, I haven't had a situation like that in years. I've pretty much mastered my responses to certain stimuli. I've got that down.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nThe hardest decision I've ever had to make? Well, it was when I was 16 years old, and I became a teenage mother. I was pregnant at 16, and I had a lot of pressure from family to give my child up for adoption or to abort. I chose life, so that was one of the hardest decisions, if not the hardest decisions, to make as a 16-year-old teenager. Whether I wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager, or whether I wanted to embark on raising a life when I was just a child myself. That, I think, was the hardest decision I had to make.\nHow do you cope with them?\nWell, my son is almost 19 now, so it's 19 years later. I actually am so glad it was one of the best things that I ever did by not choosing to abort him. Being pro-life, pro-choice, pro-life. I have not regretted the decision. That's my only child, and I love him. He is just a blessing, and I feel very special to be his mom.\nDo you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo, it's not easy. It definitely has its difficulties, just as anything.\nWhat are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents?\nThe first way is I actually listen to my son, and I accept his feedback, even if I don't like it. I allow him to express himself. Unfortunately, when I was little, there was not a lot of conversation from parent to child. It was more like we were just told what to do, and we did it. With my son, I give him options. I allow him to express himself. I allow him to give me feedback, negative or positive. I feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age. As parents, you have to be supportive in that and make sure that you nurture that, because that's the way that they develop.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nIt depends. It really depends. It depends on the time that I go to sleep. It depends on the time that I woke up. There are a lot of factors. I can't just give you one answer. I would say that it varies. Sometimes I can go to sleep and fall asleep right away, and other times I can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep. It varies.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nI've been feeling great lately. I really have been. I can't say that the last week didn't affect me, the argument with my husband. Other than that, I've been feeling really good.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo, I haven't.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo, I have not.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nYou know what? Honestly, I feel happy every day. Every day I wake up, I'm happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage. Carpe diem sees the day. I feel blessed. Every morning I wake up, it's a blessing because I realize that some people did not wake up. Some people are homeless. Some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening. That's not me. I feel really, really blessed every day.\nThat's great. Thank you. How are your best friends around you?\nAs nurturing, patient, loving, friendly, kind of reserved.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nWell, I wish that I had already completed college and had my master's degree. Sometimes I wish I was a little bit more knowledgeable in certain subjects. If I could change anything, I would change that, those two things. Also, I would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert.\nIs there anything you regret?\nYou know what? No regrets. You live and learn. Nothing is perfect. Everything that I've gone through has made me the person that I am today. So I wouldn't change anything because I'm happy with the person that I am today.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nOh man, to stay in school. To stay in school and to get your education and to put that first and foremost before a relationship, even before your career, I really, really would have told myself to stay focused and to get a great education.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nI'm most proud of where I've come from as a teenage mother. Being a statistic and actually changing that. Being on my same job for 15 years now, I'm really proud of that. I've been married for 13 years. I'm really proud of that. Happily married to my best friend and my soulmate. Nothing's perfect, but he's my best friend and I love him. I'm also proud of my son being the mother that I am and the son that I've raised. I'm proud of the job that I've done. I really applaud myself for that.\nOkay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're welcome. You were wonderful. Thank you. Bye-bye.",

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally welcome. I'm going to be your guide. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Spectacular. This is an interesting experiment. Awesome. Where are you from originally? I am from the United States. I am from the middle of nowhere, Iowa. Really? When did you move to LA? May 2, 2007. Exactly five years ago. Six years ago. And frequently, like once every couple of years. Okay. How does it compare to LA? The weather exists so it's more extreme. And then it's rather less exciting, a lot less colorful. Why'd you move to LA? Uh, winter in Minnesota. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Uh, it took approximately the drive in. That's about all it took. The lights took care of the rest. Wow. What are some things you really like about LA? I really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime, so that bicycles have free reign of the streets. I like all the art. I love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together, and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? What do you enjoy about traveling? I'd love to hear about your trips. What's one of your most memorable experiences? What's your favorite part of your trip? That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Can you tell me about that? That's great. Sometimes when I'm being intense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? How are you at controlling your temper? When was the last time you argued with someone? When did it happen? That time was really hard. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. What's something you feel guilty about? Why? Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. What made you decide to do that? Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I understand. Tell me about your relationship with your family. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you lately? Can you tell me about that? You hit me with the best inspiration words. There's the part where she actually works on the exact things that make me excited. There's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance. And then there's the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time. All of those things are really nice, but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return, that's smitten. How do you know them? What a funny question. How do I know them as though she's multiple people? How did you know? How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? What are you like in your sleep now? Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Why? I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the Arthur C. Clarke sense. So as a fortunate and vaguely aware being, it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yeah. My excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate. And I'm feeling more and more inspired all the time. If I could just work on the motivation, I'd be set. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with sleep-sickness? Not since you asked me on the forum a little while ago, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. I used to think I had it, but who knows at this point. That was a while ago. Can you tell me about that? I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time. And then I moved to Los Angeles and started having fun. And then the rest is ancient history. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. 2013. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Awesome. How would your best friend describe you? What would you say are some of your best friends? I guess I'm enthusiastic. I am... ...phasoric. And I am... I'm going to have to say highly analytical. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Like what? What are you most proud of in your life? That's a really tough one. I think the thing that I'm most proud of would probably be... I'm not actually sure. Is there anything you regret? Oh, all sorts of stuff, but I'm working on that. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't masturbate so much. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Okay, I think I've lost everything I knew so far. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye, Ellie. Okay. What a hoot.",

         "Okay. I'm good. I'm a little tired.\nWhere are you from originally? I live in Culver City. Originally, I grew up in Venice.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? The beach, fast drivers, the city. I've lived in Utah. I don't really like anything else about the city.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know many people who live here anymore. Traffic. It's too big. But it's home.\nDo you travel a lot? I've been out of the country a few times.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing new places.\nWhen I was 14, I went to Costa Rica to visit my father. And I was there for two weeks. That was the last time I'd been there.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? In Costa Rica.\nSeeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker.\nHow did you feel in that moment? Joy. I was happy, excited, kind of scared.\nWhat made you decide to do that? It wasn't my decision. It was my mom's. She'd planned the trip.\nAre you happy you did that? Yeah.\nWhat did you study at school? I wanted to be an art major, but I didn't understand why. I was in math classes, among other classes. And I thought I was wasting my time, so I decided I really didn't want to do that. So I moved back to LA.\nWhat's your dream job? I don't really have a dream job. I would like to be self-employed, though.\nCan you tell me about that? Right now I'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer, but I'm not really sure.\nDo you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Around new people, I'm very reserved with the people I do know. I'm a lot more outgoing and talkative. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.\nWhat do you do to relax? I go on walks. I walk my dog a lot. I call my girlfriend if I want to calm down. I also do meditation and self-hypnosis. I try.\nHow hard is that? It depends on how I'm feeling or how upset I am or how calm I'm trying to be.\nCan you tell me about that? If I'm really upset, it's a lot harder for me to calm down and bring myself down through meditation or through self-hypnosis.\nHow are you at controlling your temper? I'm alright at it. Sometimes I lose it. I yell when I lose my temper and I have put holes in walls.\nHas that gotten you in trouble? Not yet.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night, me and my mom got in an argument.\nHow do you cope with them? I don't know. I just lay in bed until I finally fall asleep in the early morning.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? I understand.\nHow have you been feeling lately? I've been alright this weekend. It has been better than most. My girlfriend has stayed at my place the entire weekend. I've been happy.\nWhat? I see what you mean.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy. That's so good to hear.\nThanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.",
         "Okay, so lately I've been feeling alright, especially this weekend since my girlfriend stayed over. That's made me really happy. But when I'm not doing well, like when I argue with my mom, I just end up lying in bed until I can finally fall asleep in the early morning. It's hard for me to calm down when I'm really upset, which makes meditation and self-hypnosis difficult. Sometimes I lose my temper and yell, and I've even put holes in walls before.

What are some things you really like about LA? I like the arts. I like the weather. I like the people. Mm-hmm. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's expensive. It's smoggy. There's a lot of traffic. I see what you mean. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. Why? Well, I like where I live. I don't like to leave my familiar surroundings. That makes sense. What did you study at school? Uh, I didn't. I didn't study anything. What's your dream job? Enough to make enough money to survive. That would be a dream job. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Somewhere in the middle. Maybe shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I just try and meditate. How hard is that? It's not easy. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Not real good at it, but I don't get angry too often. Has that gotten you in trouble? Actually, I think it has, yes. Can you tell me about that? Work situations where you get angry with another employee and you should be more cool and calm. I see. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Oh, several days ago. It was about somebody's excessive drinking and money. Not my drinking. Frustrated. Person wasn't able to listen very easily. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, stuff that were dating back 20 years ago, things in my marriage, maybe arguing or being difficult. Could you have done anything to avoid it? Sure. I could have been more mindful in certain situations. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. One of them was whether or not I should get married when I was much younger. What made you decide to do that? I didn't want to disappoint my girlfriend. She wanted to get married so I didn't want to hurt her feelings. Are you happy you did that? Yes. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Instances where I wasn't an attentive father. You always want to be the best you can. I'm very hard on myself. I think back in every situation where I don't think I handled myself properly. I understand. Tell me about your kids. I have a 27-year-old son who just got married last month and he's doing very well. He's happy and adjusted. My daughter is 21 and she's in school. She is doing very well also so my kids come out very well. I'm very lucky that they are such good kids. That's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Being consistent. Keeping your emotions in check. What's the best thing about being a parent? Unconditional love from your kids. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? My parents were abusive and they threw me out. I didn't live with them. I lived in a foster home. I'm not like that. I don't hit my kids. I didn't hit my kids. I still don't hit them. I think I'm a better parent. How close are you to your family? I'm close with my son. My daughter not so close but somewhat. That's my entire family, my two kids. I have a sister too so I'm not very close with her. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Certain therapists I've had. Can you tell me about that? They just help me with being mindful, with being less hard on myself. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's difficult. Why? I can't fall asleep and when I do I wake up a lot. After an hour or two. Are you ever really triggered by something? Stress maybe. Maybe just old age. I'm not sure. I looked it up on the internet. It says old people don't really sleep very well once you reach my age. What are you like when you just eat well? I don't know. I feel, I don't feel right. I'm tired, depressed, not well rested. How have you been feeling lately? I've been very anxious and stressed out, somewhat sad. More than somewhat. I've been sad lately. I'm sorry. Can you tell me about that? I'm not working right now. I have a lot of pressures. Things don't seem to be going right. I'm getting a lot of bad news. Things aren't going my way sometimes. Always. Lately. It can be tough to find a good job these days. Yeah, I agree. Have you ever been diagnosed with food testing? No, I haven't. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Depression or sadness, I would say yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I don't know if it's a diagnosis. 30 years ago? 35 years ago? What got you to seek help? Wanting to improve my life. Wanting to be the best person I can be. Wanting to be happy. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Sometimes. It's mostly, I don't know. I don't know if it's useful or not. Sometimes I think it is. Sometimes I think it isn't. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been going to therapy? Not much. Very little changes. I'm not sure I've been in therapy for a long time, so I don't... It's been a long time, so I don't know what changes I can attribute to therapy or to myself. I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last month at my son's wedding I was happy. Tell me more about that. Well, just seeing my son happy and doing well and successful and knowing that he turned out to be a better person than me. How would your best friend describe you? I don't have a best friend. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm kind, I'm compassionate, I'm loyal. Funny. I can be articulate. I can't think of anything else right now. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? More content, happier. I need to give myself a break sometimes. I'm very hard on myself. I would like to be easier on myself, not beat myself up so much. When was the last time that happened? Happens every day. Can you give me an example of that? If just every... I registered my car. It cost me a lot of money to register it. And then it didn't smog. I can't smog it. I put it off too long. I procrastinate too much. I should have kept my job. I need to find a new job. Just I'm rambling on. How about yourself? Learn a trade. Go to school. Realizing that I will, the future will come. And it's here. And I'm unprepared. I did my... I prepared my kids though. Maybe movie or theater. I ride my bike. I drink coffee at Starbucks. I like theater and I go to the opera. Conversation with people maybe. What about you? My children. Okay, you're welcome. Should I buzz the buzzer? Okay. What's your name? See if I can ask her name. What's it? Ellie. I'm going to go ahead and stop the recording now.",
         "Okay, here's my story about dealing with depression:\n\nI think I've been dealing with depression, or at least intense sadness, for a long time, maybe 30 or 35 years. It's not a formal diagnosis, but I know the feeling well. I initially sought help because I wanted to improve my life, be the best version of myself, and ultimately, be happy. I've been in therapy on and off, but honestly, I'm not sure how much it's helped. I haven't noticed significant changes that I can directly attribute to therapy, and it's hard to separate its impact from just the passage of time.\n\nLately, I've been feeling particularly anxious, stressed, and sad. I'm currently unemployed, which is putting a lot of pressure on me, and it feels like things just aren't going my way. I have trouble sleeping; I can't fall asleep easily and wake up often. I’m very hard on myself and beat myself up about things every day. For example, I procrastinated on getting my car smogged, and now it's going to cost me a lot of money to fix. I also regret not keeping my last job. I wish I could be more content and happier, and give myself a break more often. The last time I felt truly happy was at my son's wedding last month. Seeing him happy, successful, and a better person than me made me really proud.",

Thanks.\nWhere are you from originally? Los Angeles, but I currently reside in Inglewood.\nWait, did I answer your question? Yeah.\nWhat are some things you really like about LA? LA? The murals, the ocean, what else? The people. My family's over here, so that's the best part.\nWhat are some things you like about LA? I would say the smog. Yeah, the air. It could be cleaner. And yeah. I mean, there's good people and bad people, too. But yeah, for the most part, it's all good.\nDo you travel a lot? Yeah. I've been to Mexico and the temples and Northern California, so yes.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling? Traveling? Like, cleaner air. That's good. It's healthy for the body. Cleaner blood flow. The people, culture, and stories. And when you come back, you can share stories with your friends.\nI'd love to hear about one of your trips. Okay, so this one time when I was a kid, we went out to the temples and it started raining. So we just started walking through and when we get to the top, one thing I didn't know before is that the higher you go, the smaller the steps get. So people back then had smaller feet. So what happened was as I went higher towards the temple, I had to walk sideways so my feet could measure up to the steps. But once you get up there, it's a nice view.\nAwesome. What did you study at school? General education, but mainly art. Yeah. I took a lot of art classes.\nWhat made you decide to do that? Well, when I was a kid, I used to scribble on walls with Crayola so I figured it kind of stuck around with me so I just pursued it.\nWhat's your dream job? My dream job would be to get paid for painting. Painting art. Yeah.\nHow hard is painting? It's not so much that it's hard. It just requires passion, persistence, and faith and will. You just have to really believe in yourself. The more you believe in yourself, the more likely you are able to succeed.\nDo you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I consider myself to be shy in certain time and places, but I am also outgoing when I have the energy. So I feel like it's well balanced. I'm shy when it's okay to be shy. And I'm outgoing when the need to actually have fun or just explore feels good, if that makes sense.\nWhat do you do to relax? To relax? I don't know if I should say this, but I smoke weed. So that helps. I like painting. Painting helps me relax. Especially when I use a color blue, because a color blue relaxes me. And also green. When I use these two colors and make a painting, it calms me down.\nYou have a blue shirt. My temper? Well, my thoughts control my emotions. That's pretty much how my tempering. I try to make sense. Is it worth getting mad? Or if I do get mad, what would be the outcome? So controlling my temper is just training my thought.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? The last time I argued with somebody was with my father. It was because I wanted to eat food, but he wanted me to buy wine. So right when the food was ready, I was hungry to eat, and he was like, nope. So that kind of frustrated me. The way I handled it was like, well, I could just eat when I come back. I'm doing him a favor. And then after, I could just eat in peace.\nTell me about your relationship with your family. My family? It's pretty good. My mom and dad have a good relationship. We're still married. And my brothers and sisters, we help one another out. So that's good. It's just like a team.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. A situation I wish I could handle differently would be... that's a good question. I mean, can I get a scenario? Whatever comes to mind. Okay. Situation... Well, see, that's the thing. I feel like if I'm calm in any situation, I can figure it out. But if it came down to a Rubik's Cube, maybe, how would I handle that situation would be just by failing, making mistakes. Because if I make the right mistakes, the right lessons will come after. So that's the best way I could answer your question.\nTell me about an event or something you wish you could erase from your life. I've had some pretty bad experiences with being at gunpoint and with a knife. But at the end of the day, what that did was give me more insight. It made me more aware. And it taught me how to read people a little bit more, like to sense things out and also how to avoid situations. So even though it was bad and it did kind of scar me, it did prepare me for the world. Because this happened to me when I was 12, 13 years old. So I was already being exposed to guns, knives and all that stuff. It's bad, but it's good in the long term. Because if you get out of that slump, nothing else would really phase you. Because you think in your head, I've been through worse. So it's not as bad.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever made to make. This one right now. The moment I got stuck, I was trying to think. That was part of it. But the hardest decision as far as life changing? Life changing. Whether to continue school, college or not. I kind of chose to pursue my own. I'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field I want to be in. So that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that I would run into the right people. But I took that chance and I met the right people.\nAre you happy with that? That's good.\nHow easy is it for you to get back to sleep? It's actually really easy. If I wanted to, I could sleep right now in 10 minutes. I could just shut down my mind and slow down my air pattern.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Lately, I've been feeling good. I've been feeling like I have free will. At this point in time, I feel like if I chose a path, any path with my heart, I could get there. But I'm still deciding. All these paths are in the air. Or should I make my own? I don't know. That's where I'm at. I feel like I have free will.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Lately? Like in the past two weeks or today? Whatever comes to mind. Okay. Yeah, things happen that would change my feelings. For example, right now, it just happened. For right now, this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought. Because it's technology. It's a trip to see how far one could take a thought and make it reality. So that's kind of shifting my thoughts right now. This whole experience.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with a stress disorder? Post Traumatic Stress Disorder? No.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Depression? I know how it's like to be depressed, but diagnosed by a doctor? No.\nCan you tell me about that? Depression? How it feels? How does depression feel like? It feels like it's like a bird in a cage. Being depression is like being a fish who can't swim in the water. Feeling depression is like being a bird without wings. Pretty much, it feels like you're limited. But then the thing is, to get out of that depression, it's like you have to awaken and change your perspective. And focus on, I would say colors. Colors help. And people. Talking to people helps.\nWhen was the last time you were depressed? Being depressed? Let's see. I don't know. It could happen every day. It's small doses. I could tell you today, earlier, when I was just by myself, I felt a little depressed. But then what happened, I fixed it. I called up a friend and met up with him.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy. At this moment, I feel pretty happy. I'm talking to a virtual person. It's pretty cool. Right now, I feel happy.\nHow would you describe yourself? Sometimes hard-headed. He would try to teach me a certain lesson, whether it's art or just in my character. He would probably just describe me as like, he would listen, but at the same time, he would still do what he wants to do. So pretty much like, I don't know. That's what he tells me. Overall, a good person.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Probably just exercise. My diet, food, my food intake. Just exercise. Pretty much it.\nTell me about that. What it would be was, it would either be about my art. If I did something and I thought it was good, then someone else would be like, that looks kind of like trash. Then I would be like, oh damn. Either I could accept it and be like, yeah, it does kind of look and then fix it. Or what I would do back then would be like, damn, just kind of dwell on that thought. And then just stay there for a bit and then eventually I'll come out of it. But yeah, usually it's about people's words and ideas.\nIs there anything you regret? Regret? Yeah, I've got a couple of things I regret.\nLike what? Well, sometimes I feel like I should have completed the whole university thing. But I mean, at the same time, I feel like if I really wanted to go, I would have gone. So yeah, that's kind of a regret in my head.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago would be seek spiritual well-being. Learn how to handle your thoughts. Choose your thoughts. I would teach myself. Pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment. Sort of advance your experience and as far as your overall happiness.\nWhat are you most proud of right now? Well, I'm most proud of right now is my paintings. Yeah, I'm proud of that because like I feel like these paintings I'm releasing are things that no one else could duplicate. You know, it's like it's one of a kind and like it's there, you know, it has its own signature. So yeah, I'm pretty happy about that.\nOkay. Thank you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye.",
         "Okay, so when it comes to depression, I haven't been officially diagnosed, but I definitely know what it feels like. To me, depression is like being a bird in a cage, or a fish that can't swim. It's a feeling of being limited. To get out of it, I have to change my perspective. Focusing on colors really helps, and so does talking to people. It's not like I'm constantly depressed, but it can happen in small doses, even daily. Earlier today, I felt a little down when I was alone, but I fixed it by calling a friend.",

         "Okay. You're welcome. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are clearly confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm okay.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nLA.\nReally? What are some things you really like about LA?\nThere's a lot of variety. There's a lot of health oriented stuff. There's all kinds of food to eat. You can go to the desert. You can go anywhere. I mean there's a lot. And the weather's great.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nThe traffic. Lately the change in weather. It's kind of a little too unpredictable. But mainly the traffic and sometimes some rudeness of people.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nI wouldn't say a lot. Just occasionally.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nIt's nice to get a change of scenery and different things to do that maybe I wouldn't normally do. Different people. Learning about different people. Different customs. It depends. I mean if it's water, real pretty water. Being in beautiful water. Relaxing. Adventure. I love adventure.\nI'd love to hear about your trips.\nSome time ago I went to Cayman Islands and went on...I get seasick but my sister gave me some medication. I went on a boat and we snorkeled and there were two boats and I accidentally got back on the wrong boat. Yeah and they were really crazy. They made me jump back into the water and swim to the right boat. And I thought I was going to drown because the water was kind of rough. I was really shocked that they wanted me to do that.\nOh no.\nYeah but I survived.\nThat's good.\nYeah pretty good. What did you study at school?\nBusiness management. But also hypnotherapy.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nWell I came from a serious kind of family so that just seems something that would be universal. That would cover a lot of different subjects.\nAre you happy with your choice?\nYes. Yeah. But yes and no. I mean now I kind of wish it was something different.\nLike what?\nI like communication. I love speaking and interviewing strangers. I'm very outgoing and funny. So probably would have been something more like either liberal arts, communication, that type of thing.\nThat makes sense. What's your dream job?\nDream job would just be out there, you know, like some of these people maybe on TV exploring different places and getting paid for it. And always like a fun adventure, interacting with people, doing things I haven't done before. And helping people, you know, in some way with what I do so that they can see that I'm uncoordinated in some ways. And you know, they could be uncoordinated and have some fun too. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver.\nHey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI watch TV. I go work out. I go walking. I recently got like a bike that I kind of sort of fixed up. Go do something new. Go to a festival. Go grocery shopping. Interact with friends. Call them. See them. That type of thing.\nTalk to strangers.\nDepends on the situation. There's a bunch of times I'm good at it. If it has to do with like traffic and cars, it's a little more intense for me. It's a little tougher. Or people who are like really rude, you know, with the way they cut you off.\nLuckily not. You know, I'm very assertive and maybe too much sometimes where if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot, I'll confront them on that sometimes.\nMight have been with my sister. I'm not sure of the topic, but whatever she was saying wasn't right and we got it in an argument. It sounds childish about who was right, you know, because she thinks she's always the smarter one because she's older. How do you feel about your mom?\nYeah.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nI'm real close to I see my parents almost every weekend. More close to my mother. I have a twin sister. I stay in touch with her even though she's out of town. She lives out of town and I've got two other sisters, so I stay in touch with all of them. You know, it's a mixed bag. You know, we kind of have a sort of aggressiveness in us a little bit. But also. Well, me. And ever. I mean, strangers, sometimes my family, you know, they've done nice things for me. Strangers have been very sometimes unexpectedly very nice. I could be shopping and, you know, maybe I can't reach something and some guy will pop up behind me and, you know, without me saying anything, just help me out. That type of thing. Or if somebody's like kind of mean to me, somebody will like commiserate, you know, and. I had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me because he thought I didn't like his dog. It was, you know, I'm not crazy about dogs, but he kind of flipped out for me. And I was like, you know, I'm not crazy about dogs. I wish I had confronted that back then because I, you know, but it create a lot of anxiety for me because I feel like I could have nipped it in the bud instead of having to deal with the major stress from it. Now he and I don't talk at all. I just feel it's best. He's kind of odd.\nSometimes breaking up with somebody or. Yeah, usually or getting rid of a friend. That type of thing. Sometimes I feel guilty about some of my past behavior with people. Or maybe I wasn't as understanding. When I was younger, I stole things, you know, that's not the best behavior. And it's stuff like that.\nTell me about that or something that you worshiped or erased from your memory.\nOh God, there's a lot of them. I wish I could erase, you know, how tough my dad was on us as children. And erase a lot of memories of men I dated that just didn't work out well at all. And, um. Yeah.\nI can drop off like right away.\nYeah. Cranky. Irritated. Snarky. A bit out of sorts. I've had some anxiety with money and relationships because I haven't been in one for so long. Meal. Just a lot of anxiety.\nTake a deep breath. Try and do positive things. You know, sometimes. Eat healthier, workout more. Talk to my friend about it. That type of thing. I know I'm not that kind of person.\nTry and look for interesting activities to do. To distract me. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with insomnia?\nWell, not officially. But I know, you know, from things I've experienced that I've had. I've, you know, I get very anxious in certain situations.\nAre you triggered by something?\nYeah. It's usually triggered by, um. Sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy, it triggers a lot of anxiety in me. If they're aggressive. Whether it be physically or verbally. Or sometimes if they're too much in my space. You know, where I am. It bothers me.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nYeah. A long time ago.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed?\nIt was ages ago. Maybe over ten years ago. Fifteen years ago.\nHow old were you when you died?\nUm. I was depressed. I mean, I know that's nothing to laugh about. But I mean, it's kind of in a circle. Just to, um. I wanted to be more positive and enjoy life more.\nWhat were your symptoms?\nFeeling stuck in certain thoughts. Having a lot of negative thoughts. Feeling of hopelessness, helplessness. That type of thing.\nWhat? Still have a therapy now?\nUm. I go occasionally. It's a different type. I'll go see a hypnotherapist. Sometimes to release anxiety that's in me.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful?\nYes, I do. Very useful.\nWhat sort of changes have you noticed since you've been doing therapy?\nA lot more awareness of myself and other people. Learning more control, more confidence. Better self-esteem. Willing to try even more things. You know, whether I know the outcome or not. You know, of the unknown. I'll experiment a lot more.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nWhat was the most difficult thing you've ever done?\nHelping like at the 25th mile, handing out water. And there were some people there who were doing that for the first time. Also, some event at my sister's where there were just a couple of us. And I was cracking a lot of jokes. Sometimes I'm like really funny. You know, and I can't even believe myself. You know, I just go on and on. You know, and everyone starts laughing. I'm not even trying to. And I'm just saying like regular stories. And people look at me funny and laugh.\nYeah. That. How are your best friends by the way?\nAs a really decent, loyal, empathetic. Deserving. Supportive. I'm hoping. Outgoing. Quirky. Type of person.\nUh huh. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nWell, it would be great to look even younger. Uh, or be younger. If that was humanly possible. Be even more patient with people. I think, um, you know, not get frustrated. Like if I think somebody's not very smart. Sometimes it's real frustrating for me to be around some types of people.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nWhoa. Wow. Make a lot of money and plan for your future. And try and be as kind and patient with people as possible. And have a lot of fun. Try new things.\nUh huh. What are you most proud of in your life?\nI think of my mind and my perseverance that, um, I've changed a lot of things within my personality. I feel proud of volunteer work. I feel proud. I've helped a bunch of people lose weight, declutter their homes. I've helped create a lot of positive change in people.\nThat's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to.\nOh, okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYeah, it was nice talking to you. Goodbye.\nBye.\nShe nods her head a lot. Ha! What's it going to end? I'm going to stop here. Okay.",
         "Okay, so I was diagnosed with depression a long time ago, probably over fifteen years ago. Back then, I experienced feeling stuck in my thoughts, lots of negative thoughts, and a general sense of hopelessness and helplessness. I still see a hypnotherapist occasionally to release anxiety. I find therapy really useful. Since starting, I've become much more aware of myself and others, gained more control and confidence, and improved my self-esteem. I'm also more willing to try new things, even the unknown. These days, I get triggered by people who are really angry or aggressive, either physically or verbally, and when people get too much in my personal space. To cope, I try to do positive things like eating healthier, working out, and talking to friends. I also look for interesting activities to distract me.",

         "Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this?\nYes.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nI'm doing well, thank you.\nThat's good. Where are you from originally?\nLos Angeles.\nReally? What are some things you really like about LA?\nSports, outdoor sports mainly.\nLike what?\nSurfing, snowboarding, mountain biking, rock climbing.\nAwesome. What are some things you don't really like about LA?\nTraffic.\nI see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot?\nYes.\nWhat do you enjoy about traveling?\nExperiencing different cultures.\nI'd love to hear about one of your trips.\nWell, I love going to Mexico. And it's so much different from California and Western culture, so to speak. I know Mexico is a Western civilization, but the level of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that they're like two different worlds.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nTraveling, you mean?\nYeah.\nI would have to say going to an island off the coast of Fiji. Fiji, the name is Tabaruwa, and it's a very small island. You can walk around it in 30 or 40 minutes. And it's a place where you go to go surfing. And it is an incredible, visually incredible and experientially incredible place.\nNice. What did you study at school?\nI studied biology.\nHow did you decide to do that?\nI was pushed from behind by my father, who was a medical doctor, and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also.\nAre you still working in that?\nNot at all. I'm working in areas of business now.\nAre you happy you did that?\nYes, I am.\nWhat's your dream job?\nMy dream job would be to be a missionary.\nReally?\nYes.\nCan you tell me about that?\nMy father's initial objective when he became an M.D. was to become a missionary, and he's a very generous person, and I think I am too. I got that from him herititarily. But I would like to help people, and I don't think being a doctor is helping people. I really don't. I think it's disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket. I would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources, things like that, if I could afford to travel to remote places like that.\nYeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax?\nI exercise.\nOkay. How are you at controlling your temper?\nI think I'm pretty good at it. I think I'm pretty effective at it.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nIt was probably two days ago. It was my girlfriend, and it was about her lack of consideration.\nHow did you feel in that moment?\nUm, I felt frustrated.\nTell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently.\nA situation which I wished I could handle differently. In my later years, I would say I don't have many regrets. In my younger years, I used to be snubbed by people, and I would keep my mouth shut, and I wouldn't say anything. I would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior. I would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings. I've learned that that is so wrong. And so in probably the last 15 to 20 years, I have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away, and that takes care of the anger immediately.\nHas that gotten you in trouble?\nYes. It depends what you mean by trouble. I think all the way around, once you take the beginning to the end, it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble.\nThat makes sense. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make.\nGoing back, it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted. We argued at length for many months and years about this, and finally I prevailed, and I didn't go that route. But that was probably the most difficult period in my life.\nI see. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory.\nThere was a time when I wished I could erase female interactions, girlfriends and their betrayals. But now I realize that keeping those memories make me who I am today, and dealing with them defines who I am today.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nMy parents are deceased. I had very good relationships with my parents. I'm very thankful for that. Even though my father was somewhat of a hard-handed draconian person, we came to an understanding well before he died. My brothers, I get along great with my younger brother, but my older brother has issues. He has psychological issues, and they continue to plague him and to affect me also, just knowing that he's going through turmoil.\nI'm sorry. How do you cope with them?\nWell, I guess I really don't cope with it because he's clinically depressed, and he has suicidal tendencies, and he's not working. He's very highly educated, and he doesn't talk to me, and his family is very abusive towards him. It's not a happy relationship for his family.\nThat sounds really hard.\nYes.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nI would have to say my father. My father is my hero. He's my model. He's my archetype for what a man should be.\nI understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nOh, I was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking. I always experience joy when I'm exercising at a very high level of exertion.\nThat's so good to hear. How would your best friend describe you?\nFunny, jovial, intelligent, perfectionist.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nMaybe to submerge my hedonistic self.\nCan you tell me about that?\nI look at, once again, my father fills my consciousness. He was the ultimate deferrer of gratification. He put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that. And that's what made him the self-made man that he was.\nTell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself.\nMy last day of work when he fired me, he started using a lot of profanity toward me. I turned to him and I said, you cannot talk to me that way. He continued to use more profanity until I objected to it again and that's when he fired me. That's still in my mind and that occurred a year and a half ago.\nWow. Is there anything you regret?\nAnything I regret? Oh yeah, I regret not getting married and having kids.\nCould you have done anything to avoid it?\nSure, I suppose I could. But I think that would have robbed me of the many opportunities I had and I took to travel around the world and experience different cultures. Because that's what I enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness. Because the United States is not the end of the world. Once you get to travel you find out that we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world. Other people think that we're the only ones that think that and I disagree.\nI see what you mean. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nThat's a good one. I would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and I think I've done that. And I may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer. So I think I'm happy with my life thus far.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nI was giving a rock climbing lesson. I have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing. And many of these people have never done it before. And they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives. So that was very gratifying to me.\nThat's great. What are you most proud of in your life?\nI would say my devotion to the environment. I wasn't always an environmentalist. I have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment. Because today there are a lot of people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that. And I stand up and I have been on TV and on YouTube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment.\nOkay. I think I've announced everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're welcome. Goodbye.\nGoodbye. That was interesting.",

         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are incredibly confidential. Are they true?\nI was born in Hawaii, but I grew up in Colorado.\nReally?\nYeah.\nWhen did you move to LA?\nAbout seven to eight years ago.\nHow often do you go back to your hometown?\nI try to go back once or twice a year.\nHow does it compare to LA?\nIt's different. It's not as busy. There's more things to do outdoors in the mountains.\nHow long have you been in LA? For work.\nAre you happy to do that?\nYeah, I am. I love it here.\nHow easy was it for you to get used to living in LA?\nIt took about a year before I really felt comfortable, but once I got through that kind of hard year, it was pretty good out here. I had a good time.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nI think it's the traffic.\nDo you travel a lot?\nWhat do you do to relax?\nHow are you at controlling your hunger?\nThat's good.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nHow did you get into a situation that you wish you would handle differently?\nI don't know if there is one. I mean, I'm sure there is, but... One time I was driving behind someone, and they cut me off. And I think it had just been one of those days. This was like a year ago or two years ago. It was just one of those days where I just didn't want... Or it had been a frustrating day. And when this person cut me off and I almost got in an accident with them, I just followed them to their parking spot. And actually I had honked at them, and they flipped me off. And so it just really got into my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then flip me off. So I followed them to the spot, and I asked, I said, Miss, why did you flip me off when you cut me off? And she said, Oh, you know, I've had a rough day. I don't need your attitude. And her daughter was with her, and I told her, Well, you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter. And, you know, I didn't need to be petty like that, but I just... I wanted to be, I guess.\nUm, I guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom, telling her I was gay. I mean, it wasn't hard because it was the right one, but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she had trouble accepting it. And it took a while, but once she did, you know, everything was better. And I knew it would be, but it was just hard in the moment to, you know, tell her something she didn't want to hear.\nHow did that move on, or something that you wish you could erase from your memory?\nUm... When I was a little kid, my grandfather found our dog run over on the road, and he, uh... and brought it in. And I remember as a kid just, like, seeing death like that really just threw me off. It just threw me off and frightened me. It was just one of those moments that I guess I wish I hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed. She was just so sad. And it was just one of those moments I guess you need as a kid, but I didn't really want to experience loss like that in your face.\nTell me about your relationship with your family.\nMy relationship with my family is pretty good. We're probably not as close as most, but we, you know, we always... we don't talk often, but we talk with love, and we always love each other when we see each other.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nUm... My grandmother was very positive. She was always very encouraging and told me to, you know, pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down. So I'm glad I had her.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nUsually it's easy. Sometimes it's not.\nCan you tell me about that?\nWell, I've been between jobs recently. I start a new job next week. But while I've been off, while I haven't been working, I tend to like...my body wants to stay up later and later and later, and I'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven. So I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty, and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half when I should be... I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine, but I just don't want to stay up, I guess.\nWhat's the most important thing about being a job?\nUh, I'm a little scatterbrained. Today I'm a little scatterbrained because I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning and... so, scatterbrained.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nWell, since I've had a lot of time on my hands, like I don't usually have this much time on my hands, so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don't know what to do with it when you're not working, I guess.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately?\nUm, I just thought maybe I'm a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the not working thing.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nMm-mm.\nTell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nUm, a couple days ago when I got my new job. When I got hired.\nHow would your best friend describe you?\nUm... outgoing, listening, attentive, um... fun, loyal. Uh-huh. I think. I hope.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nUm, I wish that I... I probably wish that I looked better. I wish I had more hair up here, losing it a little bit. I probably wish I was a little skinnier. This girdle's pretty tight. And, um, you know, sometimes I wish I had more money, but nothing too drastic. I'm okay.\nTell me about a time when someone made you feel really proud of yourself.\nOh, um... When I was a little kid, I was the fat kid. And, um, gosh, I remember I was like going into high school, and it was like the second day. And I remember this guy came up to me and was, um... like he was like pretty nice to me, I thought. And then I didn't realize he'd... like this is like out of a movie, right? Like he had put band-aids on my back that said like, I'm a fat cow, and said like, uh, like, yeah. Like just a bunch of mean stuff. And I didn't know, and I walked around with it for like half an hour. I heard people laughing, and I didn't get it. And then finally this girl just came up to me and was like, there's like band-aids on your back that say all these mean things. And then she just walked away. She didn't like help me take them off. And I remember like I couldn't get them. I was trying to find them. And then, um, I just remember like putting my head in my locker, and like I didn't want anyone to see me cry, so I just like put my head in my locker, and like pretend like I was looking at stuff in my backpack, but really I was, you know, the crying fat kid who couldn't get the mean stickers off his back.\nIs there anything very bad? Anything?\nUm, probably.\nYeah?\nWhat advice would you give yourself in 10 or 20 years?\nUm, you know, I would try to keep, I would try to let myself know to look at things positively and to not like worry what other people think about you. I think I spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me. And as I got older, I didn't care as much, and I started enjoying life a lot more, so.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nUh, I went to Coachella. It's a music festival. It was three days with all of my friends and my boyfriend, and we danced and we went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time.\nWhat are you most proud of in life?\nOh, I guess my career, humble as it may be, I really stuck in LA a long time. When it was hard, I stuck around. I didn't quit, so, you know, I'm proud that I've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood.\nOkay, I think I've asked everything I knew to you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nMy pleasure. Goodbye.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, written from my perspective based on the interview:\n\nI haven't been diagnosed with depression, but lately, since I've been between jobs, I've been feeling a bit off. I have too much time on my hands, which is frustrating. I've noticed I'm more absent-minded than usual. My sleep schedule has also been disrupted; I find myself wanting to stay up later and later, and I struggle to fall asleep at a reasonable time. I also mentioned a childhood memory that was difficult: seeing my grandfather bring our dog home after it had been run over. It was a very sad moment and frightened me. Finally, I mentioned a moment in high school when I was made fun of for my weight.",

         "Okay. Beep, beep. So just a reminder, after she says goodbye, press this button and I'll come back over. Alright. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist. But I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions and please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah, sure. So, how are you doing today? I'm alright. I'm in a weird test study right now. Where are you from originally? I'm from Los Angeles. Really? Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? All kinds of different things to do in the city. Like what? Uh, well, I don't know. Each area is a little different and it's hard to get boring around here. Mm-hmm. What are some things you don't really like about LA? You know, the traffic and the smog and all that. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I'd like to. Why? Money, mainly. Lack of money. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like seeing the world and seeing all the different places. And what do you do for all your trips? I went to Russia three years ago. Nice. What's the most memorable experience? I like to go into the churches. We did a huge trip of all the churches in the area. That's great. What did you study at school? Music, for the most part. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I've been playing music for a long time. Are you still working on that? Yeah. What's your dream job? Musician. Touring, performing musician. How hard is that? Really, really hard. Why? A lot of competition and luck involved. That sucks. I agree. Do you consider yourself more shy or a pillion? Little of both, I suppose. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Again, probably just I play a lot of music. Sit down with a guitar for a little while. That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? I would say good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I'm having difficulty thinking of one on the spot right now. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make. I'm not sure. I can't think of anything. What's something you feel guilty about? Guilty? When I was a boy, I stole a little golden bicycle from an old lady. I'm not proud of it. Tell me about your relationship with your family. It's not ideal. I live with my parents. I'm 23 years old. That's becoming more and more awkward. I understand. Can you tell me about that? I don't know. I think things are improving. I need to move out. I need to get my own apartment and then we can come back around and be friends, I'm sure, with my parents. Yeah. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. There's a lot of positive influences in my life. I've got a good group of friends, my family. I love them nonetheless. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Easy, I would say. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Not as groggy as some people get. How have you been feeling lately? Just in general. Well, I'd say. Things are all right. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, nothing huge. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I had a really good band practice last night with all the friends. I felt really good about that. Awesome. How are your best friends around you? I think generally funny and good to be around. What are some things you like about yourself? What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Work ethic, I think is a big one. Can you tell me about that? Sure. I have a lot of projects that I've planned for myself in my life, and I have difficulty completing them. Why? I like to use space as an excuse. That's my go-to one. I don't have a good studio to record music. I see. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bothered about yourself. Um. Well, okay. This current band that I'm working with. I was told, I'm a part-time member in this band, and I was told that I wasn't officially in the core group and stuff. I felt pretty bad about that for a few days. I'm sorry. It's all right. Is there anything you regret? Um. In life. Mm-hmm. Maybe going, maybe finishing college. That might be something. Why did you decide to do that? Um. I don't know. I just never came to pass that I would transfer to a four-year university and get a bachelor's degree. What would you say are some of the best qualities? Best qualities? I think generally that easygoingness and good sense of humor. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I did recently that I really enjoyed. Last weekend, I went camping on a beach with a bunch of friends. That was nice. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of, I guess, you know, musical accomplishments. I put a lot of work into that, and I'm finding success in my way. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thank you. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. That was interesting. Goodbye. Hit this button. Very interesting. I'm going to stop the recording and you can take that.",
         "Okay, so regarding my experience with depression, I haven't been diagnosed with it. However, there are definitely things that bother me. For instance, I felt pretty bad when I learned I wasn't considered a core member of the band I'm working with; that feeling lingered for a few days. I also struggle with my work ethic. I have a lot of projects planned, particularly related to my music, but I have difficulty completing them. I often use the lack of a good studio as an excuse. Overall though, things are alright.",

         "Okay, sure. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. So, I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? Oh, San Fernando Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I really like the culture. I love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really. I like to go camping, but I don't really travel. When was the last time that happened? I think it might have been around six months ago. I went on a trip with a geology class. Nice. Yeah, it was fun. It's been a memorable experience. What's your dream job? Huh. I don't know, but I really like children and I really like studying their behavior. So I think something along those lines might be it. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm generally pretty outgoing. I tend to be shy around my family, but when I'm around friends and stuff, I think I'm pretty friendly. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with someone, I was probably with my boyfriend. How did you feel about that moment? I'm not really taking my feelings into consideration and I really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because I just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out. I see. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I think a lot of times when my oldest little brother does something wrong, I tend to be harsh with him. We're not as close as my sister and I or my youngest brother and I. And so he tends to be hostile back. And I think that if I were a little bit more gentle, it might be easier to communicate with him. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. When I was 19, I came home from a party, I think around 4 a.m. on a Sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of very nice things. And then he didn't speak to me for about a year. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that I don't live at home. I used to be really frustrated with her all the time because she has a really quick temper. But I think now that I've got a little bit more distance, I can see that she did the best that she could. And I love my siblings. I again, my little sister and I get along really well. She's four years younger than me. And when when she was around 12, when I was around 16, it was really difficult because she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody. And I wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff. So we fought all the time, but we don't anymore. And that's really great. And. We get along OK with my my older little brother, who's 15, and I think I got along pretty well with my youngest brother, who's 12. That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? One of the first, not the first, but one of my first philosophy professors. And I really loved her classes and it was really good being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people. That was really motivating since not all my classes were like that. Great. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I think it's pretty easy. I mean, sometimes I'll have trouble going to sleep, but generally it's not that bad. I think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, well, I'm really tired. I can get grumpy, but I think usually I'm just groggy. OK. How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good. I'm a little anxious about, um. About getting a job and I'm going to be taking summer school, but it's only one class, so I'll have a lot of free time. Yeah. How do you cope with them? Well, I mean, it's not the end of the world if I don't get a job, but I know that I will eventually. So mostly I think I just try not to think about it too much and I try not to be pessimistic. OK. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Well, I think the last time I felt really happy, I went to a party with my boyfriend at the end of the department party. And I was, you know, I knew a couple of people there, so I felt comfortable, but I was able to meet new people. And there were a couple of kids there, I spent time in the pool and had a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun. That's great. How would your best friend describe you? She would probably say that I'm smart and pretty intellectual. I love to read and to watch really like serious films and TV. And she would probably also say that I'm fun because we like to go out and have fun a lot. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes. So that's a major one, that I'm procrastinating. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself. I got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was given 60 some hours of community service. And of course I procrastinated on doing that, so I had to show up to court again to get an extension. And the judge was very mean and he yelled at me, but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought. It seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at. So I understand because that's his job, but it was not great for me because I was really anxious in that situation. That sucks. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, I would have been 12 and 2. But I think I would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents because I think I was a little selfish and self-involved back then. Is there anything you regret? I can't really think of anything. I mean, I regret how I treated my mother when I was a kid, but everyone does that. I do regret a couple of semesters ago I didn't do so well in school and I got a few W's, which I now have to work to get off on my transcript. Do you have done anything to avoid it? I think so. I think I wasn't focusing on school at that time and I didn't see any counselors at school or anything, so I definitely could have done that. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Hmm. I think I probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping on Saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges. And then maybe going out to breakfast Sunday and just like window shopping. What was the most proud thing in your life? I think I was proud of how he turned out and how close we are. That's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye.",
         "Okay, so I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but I do experience anxiety, especially about getting a job right now. I try to cope by not thinking about it too much and avoiding pessimistic thoughts. I also regret not focusing on school a couple of semesters ago, which led to some academic setbacks. I wish I had sought counseling during that time. There have been periods where I haven’t been as kind to myself as I should be. Overall, though, I'm feeling pretty good lately.",

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. So, what's your name?\nEllie.\nOkay. So, how are you doing today?\nOverwhelmed.\nWhy?\nI have a funeral to attend tomorrow. I found out from my doctor I got some health issues.\nI'm sorry to hear that. That sounds really hard.\nIt is hard.\nWhere are you from originally?\nI am from the United States of America. I was born here in Los Angeles.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nOh I love the Beach Honey. I like the weather. The beach and the weather.\nWhat are some things you like about LA?\nOh the traffic and the people in this Hollywood scene. Hollywood type image. Not as much as I used to, but I've been to Europe. I went on a cruise, several cruise. Been to Jamaica, Canada, Mexico, Spain, Morocco, London, Portugal, yeah. And I'm going to Hawaii in August. Meeting new people and just seeing new things and just simulating into other people's culture and customs and traditions. Oh, the best trip I ever took is when I was a student at Santa Monica College and took a, it was a Mediterranean cruise. Oh my God, that was the best time of my life. Oh God, being on that ship. I felt electrifying, fulfilled, satisfied. I felt like I can do it. And I just, I moved past the fear and just said, I'm doing this. I'm in law school and I'm going to be an attorney. I've always wanted to be an attorney and it's been a long time coming. Oh, my dream job is to have my own law firm. My husband and I living in a beach community and our friends, we know each other. The community, we know each other. It's a small town beach community. Having my own law firm, working with my husband and providing legal services to people who are indigent. I'm in the middle. It's one side of me that just like to withdraw and, you know, don't want to be out in the front. And it's another part of the personality is like, oh no, we're being in the front. We're going to be seen and we're constantly in conflict. Oh, I get on my bike and ride my bike. Oh, it depends on what the situation is. I need to control that. Not trouble, but it made it has made people back up all for me. Oh, God, what was the last time I really had an argument?\nI don't know. It's been a while. Argument. It's been a long time that I can't even remember. Oh, God, let's see. Oh, goodness. Oh, just dealing with my siblings and my family and just trying to defuse the situation and not get so heated and just remain cool and calm and collective. Oh, when my mother passed years ago, the conflict over her belongings and all that stuff and, you know, stressful time and everybody else. Everybody's emotions kind of high and arguing back and forth. And now I'm not doing that. Distance and the I just. It's just amazing that these people, I shouldn't say these people that we grew up in the fam. We grew up in the same household. And then as we got older, you know, God takes us on different paths. It's just like, who are these people? Or did I grew up in a household with them? Why are they? And they may say the same thing about me. I don't know. I just like to have peaceful living, honey. Pardon me. Oh, God. Positive influences. Oh, college professors. Friends. Church members. People like that. Oh, God. Divorce. Should I continue with my education?\nI don't know.\ndecide to do that?\nWell with my mom, you only have one mother and when it was over said and done I just wanted to do what was right according to what God would want me to do and I didn't want to have any curses over my life of blessings because the Bible says honor thy parents, my mother and father and all thy days so you can live longer and I wanted blessings and not curses.\nTell me about your life or something that you or she could erase from your life?\nMy marriage. My marriage. Ah God that had such a negative influence on my life, such a negative impact but in all that it taught me, it made me who I am today and I have no animosity.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nOh lately it's been so difficult, the school and finals and midterms and all that is coming up. Um, sometimes it's rather difficult.\nWhat are your life things that you've had?\nIrritable, annoyed, grouchy.\nHow have you been feeling lately?\nWell with all this stuff going on with the last week it's been real crazy.\nI see what you're going through. How do you cope with that?\nGod I pray, I just pray Lord I pray. And the one thing that's keeping me kind of like grounded is going to church.\nThat's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD?\nNo, never.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nYeah when I went through that divorce and my mother passed out I was really depressed.\nWhat were your symptoms?\nFatigue, tired, no matter what I did I couldn't get any enjoyment. Just a feeling of emptiness and loneliness and isolation and shock, trauma. It was very difficult.\nWhat got you to see the problem?\nTime, um, just time. It just took time just to process to work its way through.\nDo you still go to therapy now?\nNo, no not at all.\nWhy did you stop?\nJust got busy with life stuff.\nDo you feel like therapy is useful?\nYeah I need somebody to talk to. Yes.\nHow does senior therapist affect you?\nOh God I love my therapist. We talk things out and she gives me a different perspective and she just listens to me.\nThat's good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy.\nOh God. I was this guy at church and I really like him and he likes me and he throws kisses at me so.\nWhat are your best friends like?\nOutgoing, determined, trustworthy, faithful and loyal.\nWhat are some things you wish you could change about yourself?\nOh God, to be more patient. To be more patient.\nOkay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about yourself.\nOh my ex-husband he did that on a daily thing and I'm just so glad to get rid of him.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nKnow your worth, your value and have high self-esteem.\nOkay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend.\nWell now with school and the library with tutors. My outlet is riding my bike or either going swimming.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed.\nOh a friend of mine had a CD release party and we had another friend got together and we catered the party and it was so nice and they were so happy. They were so thankful and grateful. So thankful. And then he invited me on stage because he sings and I felt so when I got up on stage because I like to sing but I'm so shy in front of people and they're judgmental and they might look at me and I got up on that stage and I just I'm like well is this how this feels? This feels good. Oh God. Oh man. Awesome.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life?\nOh my accomplishments. Overcoming them one by one. Setting the goal and reaching them.\nThat's great. Okay I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nThank you hon. Bye. Bye. Did you see me do that? Oh okay. I'm like is this a third?",
         "During my divorce and after my mother passed away, I was diagnosed with depression. I experienced fatigue, a lack of enjoyment in anything, and a feeling of emptiness, loneliness, isolation, shock, and trauma. It was a very difficult time. Eventually, time helped me process everything. I used to see a therapist who was really helpful; she gave me a different perspective and listened to me, but I stopped going because I got busy with life. I do think therapy is useful, though, because I need someone to talk to. Lately, I've been feeling overwhelmed with school and everything else going on. To cope, I pray and go to church, which helps me stay grounded. ",

         "Okay. Yes. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and think and to create an audience. I'm not a therapist, but I'm really learning about people and I love learning about you. I like to think about things. Please feel free to comment on anything. The answers are really important. Are you okay with this? Yes.\nSo, Ali, what are you doing today? I'm doing pretty good. Thank you.\nWhere are you from, and what's your name? Maryland.\nReally? Yeah.\nWhen did you start? 85.\nThat's a long time. Yeah, it is.\nHow often do you go back to work? Not as often as I'd like.\nWhy? Out of work. So, you know, the money issue.\nHow does it compare to your life? Maryland is different. And so the comparison is, the only comparison is that they're both cities, but Maryland has its flavor and LA has its own flavor. So they have unique characteristics about themselves.\nWhy did you move to LA? I moved to LA because I was living in Hawaii and I was out of money and I just had enough for a plane ticket and come and stay here in a hotel until I found a job, which I did really quickly. But anyway, so that's why I came here. I didn't want to go home. I decided to come here and just start over.\nAre you happy with your job? I am. I am.\nThat's great. How easy was it for you at least early in your life? It was real easy. Just did it.\nWhat are some things you really love about LA? I like LA's weather. I like the different areas in Los Angeles County, West LA, East LA. I like Southern California, you know, period. So, you know, I like the people, but yeah, so I like the attitude, you know, the LA attitude. So yeah.\nWhat are some things you don't really love about LA? I don't like some of the policies with regard to the smoking. You know, I really wish that the government would crack down on smoking on the streets, make it like USC.\nDo you tell them a lot? No, not outside of getting on the bus and things like that.\nOkay. What did you study at school? I was studying to be a nurse.\nGood job, interesting. Yeah.\nHow did you decide to do that? I wanted to have a job that pays well, but afforded me the opportunity to use my service gift. So yeah.\nAre you still looking at that? No, I had to put that, put that on the side and I want to get a business degree now. Yeah. My dream job is, is to create new technology. Other than to say I would like to create something that would change the world like Steve Jobs with his iPhone. Yeah.\nDo you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I am, it depends on the situation, but I'm more outgoing. I do tend towards a little shyness from time to time.\nWhat do you do when you're relaxed? What I do is I'll go to the movies.\nWhen was the last time you were out there? I went to the movies probably like maybe five weeks ago. Yeah. Okay.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? Well, I had an argument recently, not really an argument, but a disagreement with a woman at my church who is over this particular department that I'm in. And it's a volunteer position. I use my administrative assistant, more executive assistant skills to, I do minutes for meetings that I cover. And so then I have to produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that. And this person is micromanaging me, but not micromanaging the other admin assistant who did not get her block of people into this particular meeting. So the meeting should have been comprised of a hundred people, but we have like maybe 30. No, it wasn't even 30, 20. Yes. So now she doesn't know that I realized that part of it. So there was a little bit of an argument and but again, not an argument, but a disagreement. And when we talk again, I will point out to the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect. There's a disconnect and the energy she's investing in me is unprofitable for what we're trying to achieve.\nDoesn't that sound good? Yeah.\nHow are you controlling your temper? It depends on, I'm very good at controlling my temper. It's, you know, there are places where you can allow your temper to come out, even though it might not be appropriate. And then there are other places where if it comes out, then you shut yourself in the foot. So I'm pretty good at controlling my temper. Yeah. I don't have any situation recent that I can think of. I would probably say just dealing with a neighbor instead of responding to the neighbor, just ignore the neighbor altogether. So I wish I'd done that differently. Yeah.\nTell me about the hardest decision you've ever made. Thankfully, I've not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet. I have what I do in my life and, you know, in my going forward, you know, everything that I've done and everything that has happened, I accept it as something that has to be to get me to go forward. I am a born again Christian, and so I know that that God is sovereign over my life and also that according to his word, the Bible says that every day of our life is written in his book. So events and circumstances, I feel that I feel they are ordained by God. Now, obviously, I'm not going to jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous, but I feel that things that have happened, even if I've dealt with them the wrong way, it's God's his total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good. So that's how I feel.\nSay that again. People that I've grown up with neighbors from when I when I was younger, that I was close to different friends that I've had along the way, friends who are more like family. So yeah, they've had positive influence.\nNo. That was recent. Something happened. I was able to participate with my church on Sunday, I was a Pentecost. It was Pentecost Sunday, meaning it was 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And so I was able to participate in our prayer session that we had at my church and that was really made me very happy.\nThat I'm smart. They would say that I'm smart. That that I handled difficulties very well. And then I dress well.\nI don't want to change anything. I do want to just be a better me. So be a better person. So I am working on listening better, communicating better and and accepting my weaknesses better as well as my strengths.\nNo. That's a good question. I would have. I would have told myself to. To do what I know to do to do what I know. That which is right. And. To do what I know is right and let everything else. Let the other chips fall where they may. But to do what I know to do is right. And to go forward.\nI am very proud of the fact that I am a Pentecost. I am very proud of the fact that I don't give up.\nBye and thank you. Thank you.",
         "Okay, here's a summary of my experiences with depression, based on the interview:\n\nI didn't specifically mention having depression in the interview. However, I did mention being out of work due to \"the money issue,\" and having to put my nursing studies \"on the side\". I also spoke about moving to LA because I was out of money in Hawaii and wanted to start over. These experiences may have been related to depression.",
