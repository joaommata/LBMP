Okay. When you're finished, you can go ahead and ring the start button. Okay. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... All my family's here, friends, a mixture of people, and a lot of things to do. Okay. What did you study at school? Early childhood education. Nice. Are you still working in that? No, not right now, but I would love to get back into it. Why? Love working with kids, seeing them smile. Tell me more about that. I guess it goes back to when I was a kid. I liked being happy and playful, so I guess it just transferred to my adult life. What's your dream job? Working with kids as a school teacher, or in that capacity. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is, but if it's a passion of yours, it'll always be fun. That's great. How close are you to your family? Very close. Sometimes too close. Can you give me an example of that? I have four sisters and one brother. On my mom's side, and on my dad's, I have six brothers and four sisters. We are intertwined together, so that's why I say we're too close sometimes. I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself an engineer? No. Why? I have a lot of friends that I interact with, and we're always doing different things, so that's why I say I'm not. Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? Curse. Just let it out. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? A couple days ago. My nephew didn't call me back. How did you feel in that moment? Kind of mad, because I had set aside some time to spend with him, and he just blew it off and then called me back. Yeah. That sucks. Yeah, I know. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm okay. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When my mother passed. I'm sorry. Tell me more about that. It's been about five years now to the day. It's getting better. Time makes it easier. That's good. Do you feel down? A lot, because there's a lot of things that make me think about her on a daily basis. Like what? Anything. Driving by a particular restaurant that she likes, watching different TV shows. Just anything that could trigger a memory of my mom. Yeah. When was the last time that happened? Yesterday. How do you cope with them? I think about the good times. Don't stay in that place too long. Just go ahead and think about it and move on. Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not officially, but I think I might be depressed. Tell me more about that. Well, since my mom passed, it's been kind of rough. The job situation is not stable here in California, so that has a lot to do with it as well. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is. Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Not really. I've been sort of just to myself, reserved. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Not really. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. What are you like when you do sleep well? Grumpy, irritable, fidgety, big ball of nerves. Do you travel a lot? What do you mean? Whatever comes to your mind. I guess so, yeah. I like to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting new people, different locations, scenery, different opportunities to try something new in a new location. Awesome. I'd love to hear about your trips. I just came back from Memphis about three weeks ago. Going to see family and friends. It was pretty nice. Got a chance to see something new. Change the scenery. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Wow. Stick to the plan and don't veer off to the left or right. Just go straight ahead. What made you decide to do that? Just different circumstances in life that gradually pushed me towards the left and the right. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Every day. Is there anything you regret? A few relationships, not staying in school, missing out on great opportunities with employers. How would your best friend describe you? Funny, loyal, spontaneous, life of the party. How do you know them? Grew up together in the same community, went to school together, high school friends. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Big sister Michelle, my friend Troy. I mean there's others, but those two, no matter good or bad, they're always in my corner for me. Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. When was the last time you were really happy? Yesterday. Celebrated birthday. Ah. That's great. I'd love to hear all about it. It was just a little small, intimate setting. Cooked a meal, had family and friends over, listened to music, watched movies, talked about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one unit. So it was just a nice evening. Yeah. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye bye. Was the screen like that the whole time? While I was talking. It was? Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. That's very bizarre. I've never seen you do that before. Have to do it over? No.",

So there we go. Perfect. And now we can get started. When you're finished, when she's done, we'll hit this so that I know that it's going to be okay. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? Okay. How about yourself? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? Here in California. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Oh, well, that is big and brought us a lot to do, a lot of job opportunities in other states. Pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here. Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Maybe the violence rate, the bad news, even though you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still have to watch it so you can look out to see what's going on on a daily basis. What did you study at school? Sociology. I have a two-year degree in liberal arts, but my major was sociology. Nice. Are you still working in that? No. I'm still working as a MTA bus operator. What's your dream job? Well, since METRO is study growing, my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week. So, because they look to promote within the company, so that's a good thing. It's a lot of opportunities at METRO where you can take classes and they'll pay for tuition and things of that nature. That sounds like a great situation. Thanks. How hard is that? Well, it's not actually hard. Right now, it's easy if you take advantage of it right now because they look to promote within, so since I'm already working there, that's a good thing. So, it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible. Do you consider yourself an introvert? What do you mean? I'm sorry. Let's come back to that later. Okay. What do you do to relax? Read, take a long walk, hot bath, meditate, just close my eyes sometimes. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty much good because see, by me being a bus operator, you run into circumstances and situations, you've got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time. How hard is that? Well, I look at it like it goes with experience. You do something on a continuous basis. Usually, somewhere down the line, you become good at it. I look at it like that. I've been driving for years and dealing with the public, so it's just how you handle circumstances. You treat people like you want to be treated. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. I'm pretty good at it now, maybe when I was younger. As you get older, you get wiser and you learn different things, and I'm still learning today. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I would say my family, my kids. Even though I've been having a lot of deaths around me, but that's part of the life experience. You're born here, but you've got to leave here one day. My kids will keep me sane, and I love them, and my family. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Setting good examples, because you're the first teacher. You want to set a positive good example for your kids, and I think that's a good thing, and it starts at home. Can you give me an example of that? By you being the first teacher, you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up. Whatever's been taught in the home, they look in and learn every day. Whether it's at home school, kids have a tendency to do things what they see. You try to keep it positive, teach them good morals and values, and how to get along with other people, regardless of race, and different things of that nature. How many of your kids? I have a four and a half year old son. I have a seven year old daughter, and I also have a 23 year old. I'm about to be, well, my daughter's pregnant with the boy. She has three little girls, so I have three grandkids, and one on the way, which is the boy this time. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? The hardest thing is, well right now, I'm a single parent, so that makes it hard alone itself. They can be expensive at times, and it depends on the person's situation, whether they have help or a job, things of that nature to help the situation better. But it's hard. I try to keep a job, keep food in the house, just maintain and support my kids the best way I can. What's one of your most memorable experiences? With my kids, or just period. Whatever comes to your mind? What's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree. So it's kind of like, yeah, even though I'm the baby of ten kids, and I always kept that in the back of my mind, even though everybody, well pretty much my whole family have a decent job, but I'm the one with a degree. So I kind of gave myself a pat on the back. That's the only thing I remember in graduating, and my family there to support me. That's so good to hear. Thank you. How did you feel in that moment? Happy that I accomplished something. Even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma. I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident. I never went back. I got distracted. I was working at the same time, but I was just like more so. I needed income than schooling at that time, because I was a young parent, because I had my daughter at 17, so I was like I needed the money to support her. But I never went back, but I feel like it's never too late. So I felt like I'd take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder, so that's why I'm starting my class next week. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Hmm. Well, the advice I would have gave myself, that I probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age, and that I probably wouldn't have stayed in school, not let the accident just distract me. I would have remained in school. I probably wouldn't have had kids early. I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something. I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person, just having knowledge and learning different things. Keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day. So I think that's a plus in anybody's shoes, just to better themselves through education, maybe to promote within your company, or whatever the case may be to help better your career. Yeah. Have you done anything to avoid it? I'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes, but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones. I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change, like myself, even though I'm going to school late, but still, I'm going. I want to better myself career-wise. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Yes. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? My oldest daughter. We had an argument because just the life she's living right now and the things that she's going through, and I had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation. We got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear the stuff that you're saying, even though it's true, or they just don't want to hear it. They may be going through something they don't want to hear, but we got into an argument about it, but that just happened. I just told her my- How close are you to them? I'm sorry? How close are you to them? Very close. Very close. The situation my daughter is in right now, she just needs to make some changes to better her life. She's kind of like stubborn in her own way. I was raised to listen to your mom. Your mom was not going to tell you nothing wrong. I've been telling her over the years different things. It's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite, and now she's regretting it. She's like, my mom told me this. Why am I doing the opposite? I guess she's got to bump her head a couple of times to get it. It's kind of like I didn't tell you, I didn't leave it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change. How hard is that? It's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. It seems like it's taking forever for her to change, but it's left up to the individual when they're ready. You know what I mean? Once a person gets tired of something, they make a change. It may not be when you want it to happen, but the ball is in her court. I only can do so much. I see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Oh, wow. I have my days. Since I have two little ones, I kind of like train them to go to bed at 8 o'clock because they've got to go to school. I think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kind of like gets you ready for the next day. How are you going to feel if you rest? What type of person are you going to be that day? I'm going to be that day because everybody has their days, whether they're good or bad, but that's just part of life. I feel like if you had a good night's rest, hopefully you'll have a good day. Do you feel that way often? Pretty much. I need my rest because I'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people. The job itself is very stressful, so I feel like if I'm rested it'll help me. What are you like when you don't sleep well? What am I like? Irritated, tired, lazy. I feel like I'll want to lay down and probably go to sleep and get the rest that I need. What do you do when you're annoyed? I never thought about that. Like I said, everybody has their moments, they do. I never thought about that. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? I don't really have a best friend, but a person that I deal with, that I used to work with, she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing, a go-getter, dependable, responsible. I'm a people person. I get along with others. I leave a good mark, whether I know you or not. If you were like you and I now, you'd probably say, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever, something like that. That's great. Thank you. When was the last time you felt really happy? Well, I try to stay happy. I'd rather be happy than sad. My kids keep me going, you know what I mean? Especially when I go to pick them up from school or maybe, hey mom, you know, that just kind of like make my day. Just them run up to me, you know, and be happy and excited. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're more than welcome. You have a good day. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. You're welcome. So I'm going to turn all this off and then we can just have a little closer look. Okay. That is so interesting. Mm-hmm.",

And just stay active, stay healthy. Anything that's outdoors and active and healthy. Hiking, biking, rollerblading, skateboarding. Probably... That's good. Do you travel a lot? No. Why? Not really in a position to travel financially. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? If I could, I'm sure I would enjoy seeing all the different cultures and places and meeting all the different people and all the interesting structures and food. Yeah. What do you do to relax? I meditate. And I sit down. I meditate. And I skateboard. Well, I can meditate on my board. Could you say a little more about that? I meditate. It helps me relax. Sometimes if I don't really feel like skating hard, I'll just go for a nice sunset skate and meditate, a nice two hour skate and just relax. That sounds like a great situation. How hard is that? It's not that hard. You just gotta get to the skate spots. I usually like skating. There's some good skate spots in LA, streets in LA. The beaches is always good. Nice. Just, it's really not that hard at all. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? The situation with my life right now, I can't find a fucking job. I just need a job. It can be tough to find a good job these days. I don't even care about a good job. I just need a job. Anything that pays. Just gets, gets, just gets hard after a while. Yeah. Can you tell me about that? I mean, I applied from anywhere and everywhere. From entry level to management to anywhere in between. I can't find a job. I can't get a job. I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying. Yeah. I'm sorry. It is what it is. Do you feel down? Yeah, it's pretty depressing. It's hard. It sucks. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It isn't. Do you feel that way often? Yes, at this, that happens often. When was the last time that happened? Last night I couldn't sleep. Why? Just thinking about my situation. A car payment was due yesterday. And I just, I don't know if I have what it takes to continue to do this. You know, I survive day by day trying to see if I can eat. At the end of the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? About three years ago. Four years ago. Couple years ago. What got you to seek help? My mood was just not right. I was always feeling down and depressed and lack of energy, always wanting to sleep. Lack of interest. Do you feel like therapy's useful? I've gone to therapy. It has been useful for me in the past. Is it useful for me now? I don't know, I don't have health insurance. I would love to talk to someone. I just feel like I don't have anyone. So I don't depend on anyone. Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Oh yeah, I've always felt depressed in my life. What were your symptoms? Lack of energy, wanting to sleep a lot, lack of interest. My appetite was uncontrollable, either lack of or I was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things. Having noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Yes. Can you give me an example of that? My sister just passed away. I'm sorry to hear that. It's all right, six months ago. And I became homeless and jobless two weeks ago. Homeless and jobless two weeks ago. And I got to a point where I just missed her and I wanted to be with her. Yeah. How close are you to your family? Pretty dysfunctional family. You know, really can't depend on them. That's why I just depend on myself, so. That sounds really hard. It is what it is, what are you gonna do? Yeah. I'd like to give up, but my parents just buried their daughter six months ago. They don't wanna bury their other daughter. So. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't know. I don't know, I just, I just haven't had good luck. I was a corporate manager for 20 years. And, who would've known 20 years ago what advice I would've given myself because I tried to commit suicide instead of returning back to work. And so now it's just, it's been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and get my life back together. I don't know what advice I would give myself when I started with my corporate job 20 years ago. Okay, I didn't know I'd be here 20 years later. You know? Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy? A couple days ago this week, I've been trying to make ends meet. I've got a lot of things prouding. I've got a lot of things that are happening for me, but I need like two more weeks here in LA so I can connect the dots. But financially I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. So I was happy because I was getting callbacks. Things were starting to look up for me, but it's just time again isn't on my side. So my car is packed and I'm hitting the road and I'm taking off and I'm leaving LA. How would your best friend describe you? Loyal, emotional, strong, and a little bit of a Do you consider yourself an introvert? I have been lately. I was an extrovert for 20 years when I was a corporate manager. And now I am quite an introvert and I stay to myself. What made you decide to do that? Circumstances in my life I don't feel as confident. I don't feel as charming and as social. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I don't know. It's hard to say. Can't really answer that one. Okay. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Okay.

I try to keep my mind off of it. I do yoga and other things to keep my mind off of everything. Have you ever been to therapy now? I never went to therapy. Why? Wait. No. I did go to therapy. When was the last time you went to therapy? Three or four years ago. I went to a separate therapist, but then I went to a thing where they did a bunch of cognitive tests and memory tests, and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time. I get depressed and it lasts for months on end. What type of therapy do you do? Okay. What were your symptoms? I don't know. What the fuck? Let's come back to that later. Yeah. Do you have any memories of that? I mean, my wife left like three weeks ago, so yes. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done, so yeah. Well, considering I'm only 19, if I could go back 19 years, I would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would have drove away my wife and not to be angry. Yeah. Driving away my wife. Yes, many, many things every day. Well, I could have not broken stuff, and I could have stopped. Like I was basically blocking out the external universe, and I was putting everything into myself and focusing on other things so that I don't focus on the real life. I was basically escaping. And so in that sense, I wasn't paying attention to her, and that's basically why she left. I mean, that and being angry is like both contributed their own proportion. Their own portion. Earlier today. I mean, I feel really happy all the time, and then it just goes away. It's like back and forth. Like one day, one second, I'll be really happy, and then another second, I'll be really sad because I'll think about something again. It's like I got to keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like think. And I really know how to explain it. It's just something you feel. No, you need better programming. Silly. I'm creative, potential of intelligence. Charming. I'm loving. At some points, I'm all of those things. At some points, I'm not. Doing yoga and playing video games and having my wife around. My hip hop. I mean, kid travel here. You need better programming. Kid Traveller is my friend. To be a hip hop artist. I don't know. I just started one day. Not hard anymore. I mean, it was hard when I was practicing when I was younger. I was like 11 or 12. Now it's just easy. I'm still in school. No problem. Have a nice day.",

         " There you are. Don't I look gorgeous? Let me straighten up a little bit here. Okay, so I'm just going to do something that syncs our equipment. Okay, now you're going to chat with her for a bit, and then when you are done, I'm going to give you the doorbell again, and I'm going to put it right over there. Okay. When she says you're done talking, if you just want to ring it to let me know. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming to Music Week. I just created a song for people in the same community here in Miami. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me an email. And your answers are really important. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, are you doing okay? Quite well. I feel good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Here. Really? Mm-hmm. One of the few native-born Los Angelesians. What do you do now? I homeschool my 10-year-old son, and I'm a homemaker. I have five children and married 22 years. Wow. Mm-hmm. So that's a full-time job. Huh? Have you traveled a lot? Somewhat. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah. So I would say yes. I've traveled a bit. I'd love to hear about one of your friends. Well, most recently, like two months ago, we went to Israel for a pilgrimage. We were gone about nine days, and it was fabulous. We spent the first five days in Korazim, which is near the Galilee, and in a place called... I mean, the name of the area is Korazim, but we stayed in a place called the Doma Scalileia, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. That's so good to hear. What do you enjoy about traveling? I enjoy... Really, the most important thing I enjoy is meeting the people and, of course, seeing the history, especially Israel. I mean, it's totally ancient, but most I enjoy is the people, I think, to get a better understanding of how different cultures live. Okay. You can do this all by yourself? No, not at all. Why? Just don't. All my life, I've always been open and willing to socialize, and I remember my younger brother always joking, saying that I would talk to anybody, and I will. I'll talk to just about anybody, just because I enjoy learning about other people. That's good. What do you do to relax? By the end of the day, after I've cooked dinner, and we've had dinner together as a family, there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while, and then watch TV, have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax. That's what we do. Because we have a lot going on, we don't stay up too late, and I like to watch crime dramas. Nice. What does it mean to be really mad? Really mad? Probably not a lot. I get frustrated with, for example, my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever, so that gets me angry. In terms of really getting heatedly angry, other than little things that my children do, especially my oldest child who's 21, he can be confrontational. Other than that, nothing really gets me really angry. I haven't felt that. What's the best thing about being human? Contributing to society, helping to raise responsible people, I guess. Of course, the love and the affection and the fun and the excitement that goes with it, and all the stages that go. Right now, I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers. I have one 11-year-old, and the rest are all teenagers and adults. It's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world, and have challenging discussions and that sort of thing. It's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and changing diapers and that kind of stuff. What's the hardest thing about being human? The hardest thing is that it's 24-7. You're never not a parent, and so you have to accept that. I remember with my first child thinking, when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. There's no going back. I guess you could if you did something horrible, but in normal circumstances you can't change that. It's a permanent thing. In some ways it takes away your freedom, but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. I'm sorry? I didn't get what you said. Some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life, most importantly my church and my faith, but also my husband. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very logical thinking and very grounded. If I get emotional or I get upset about something, we balance each other out. Likewise, if he gets upset about something, I'm able to balance him out. That's been a great gift in my life. How do you do it completely? I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper. Occasionally I get angry, but rarely do I have outbursts. I'm more likely to say what I feel, not let it build up. My husband and I don't rarely fight, have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that. It almost never happens. Like I said, I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot. If I'm thinking something, I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. That's good. When was the last time you argued with your husband? Usually I'm arguing with my older son because he thinks he knows everything. He's 21 years old, so he has the know-it-all mentality. I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all. As life goes on, he'll learn more. He's very confident and very self-assured. He thinks that everything he does is correct. He still has a lot of learning to do. It sounds really hard. It can be. What do you think is a good kid? I think that many of them are spoiled and live in an environment of instant gratification, which I think is going to be detrimental to the future of this country. Given that, with all the technology we have, there's really not any way to go back. I have hope that they will... I think this country was built on hard work and ethics. Hopefully, the next generation and the generations after that can maintain that standard of living. I don't know if it's possible. How would your best friend describe you? As loving, nurturing, funny. We laugh a lot. Caring, honest. Things that... I mean, my best friend... Well, actually, my best friend is... It's two people, it's two sisters that I grew up with. We, for some years, took care of their mother who has Alzheimer's before my parents got sick. I have a very close relationship with them, still do. I'm considered the fourth sister. I would say that those are my best friends. We love each other very much. It's a good relationship. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long have you been diagnosed with depression? Minorally, depression. It was more anxiety. Probably... It's probably been five or six years. I've had it off and on all my life, but it was never diagnosed originally. As a teenager, I think is when I first started with the anxiety. Other than that, I... Depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. But now it's under control. I have a great... Are you triggered by something? No, I think it was what they call free-floating anxiety. I think it's a kind of organic reason for it. In other words, there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The holidays were great. We had a good family gatherings. A little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out. My dad is really sick. We've offered to move in with them. They have a big home, but we would have to do a lot of... Some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around. We're in the throes of that. That's a big change, but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get... They're in their 80s. As they get closer to death, I want to have my family there with them. I understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not easy. Usually, all my life I think I've always... I mean, I've always had... At least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, basically. Other than that, I mean, no. Now I sleep well. Other than that, I sleep well. But sometimes if I wake up really early in the morning, then I can't go back to sleep. I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on what my schedule is and if the kids have to be at school early. There's a lot of factors. That sucks. Yeah, sometimes it does. What are you making your sleep from? Probably basically the same. I think I might complain a bit like, oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever, you know. But I think overall I'm probably the same. My kids know. I'll tell my kids, oh, I'm really tired. And they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful. And maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know, they may pitch in a little bit more. I can understand she's using it to be there. Not really. Not, not, no. Not really. Not anything significant. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Actually, yes, I do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Tell me more about that. Well, we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety. And we have had her in therapy for some time. And we just recently are, we're about to finish a group with her. It was a six month group for DBT, it's called. And it's like a, it's the first time, it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And it's been really good. It's been very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental strategies to keep your, keep you from your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or, you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So that's the focus of the therapy. And it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter. And it's been really, really informational and really helpful, I think. That's so good to hear. What got you to see the company? Oh, my daughter was, she was in a bad way. She was, you know, suffering a lot. And we knew it and we acted on it. That's all. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Like really joyful and happy, I would say probably. I mean, probably it would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the, in Cana. So, you know, where the wedding of Cana took place. That was really moving and beautiful. And it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day. We flew to Israel. So it was right at the same time. It was beautiful. Very meaningful. And other than that, I would say, you know, like other joyful occasions have been, you know, like Christmas and, you know, family gatherings and, you know, my dad's birthday. He turned 83 on Christmas Eve, you know, that kind of thing. So. What are some things that you do? That's an interesting question. I would say once I get like things done that I need to do, like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once I get them done, I feel like a sense of accomplishment. You know, much like I mean, I worked for many years as an administrative manager at UCLA. And, you know, once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that you have to make deadlines. There's that feeling of like, yeah, I got it done, you know. So I think that would be, you know, for me, the most most recent way of feeling good and feeling, you know, like feeling accomplished. What's your dream job? Dream job? I think I've already lived it. I'm also a birth doula. And yeah, and so I've attended a lot of births and now I really only do it for family and friends. And it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth, the bringing of new life into this world. So I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and I didn't know it. I trained much after, you know, I did my managerial stuff and was it is and was awesome. So I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed. But like I said, I do for family and friends. What made you decide to do it? I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She she happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children. And I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. We were close friends and, you know, her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there. She wanted me to stay. She didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it. So that was the first birth that I attended outside of, you know, my self-giving birth, which is a whole different experience. So after that, I was really interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery. But then I discovered this thing called being a doula, which is really gives you even a lot more hands on one on one contact with the patient, which is what I like. So I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old. No, 16 years ago. So, yeah, and I've been. Well, it can be challenging in terms of hours. It depends on how long the woman's in labor. But and, you know, also like for me, I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100 percent. I'm not doing it for business. And that way and because of that, I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available, somebody else could fill in for me. So but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me, I've been able to be there for some reason. So the the the only one that I missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby. I was with her for her first, but her labor went so fast she didn't even call me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor. She would even if she had called me, I would have been there in time. So went really fast. But other than that, you know, yeah, I've been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In all of life or in your job? Probably my my own birth. I mean, my the birth of my own children. Like there's an extreme sense of joy, excitement, relief, because of course you're out of the pain. And then like it's just it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's it's like something you can't explain. It's it's just it's awesome after you give birth. So and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I had my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both both experiences. I was my third child that had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic. But other than that, we laugh about it now. But when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she she was not there when the doctor I mean, it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And my husband was there, but she was not. No, it was a doctor. And she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that. And my daughter was born in the bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor. But I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago, 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more not as relaxed, not as like I feel now at my age that I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry about I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what you know, you know, like my I notice my daughters. Oh, Mom, you can't wear that because people are going to say this. I say, I don't care. You know, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that, oh, Mom, you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever. So that would probably be it. The wisdom that you you achieve with age that you see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. Most proud of. Probably my family, my husband and my my children. I mean, the fact that we've stayed married, that we've were an intact family, that my kids see every day how their friends suffer, who who come from divorced families or single parents. And they they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. Probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years, I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people I know from church. And it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. OK. OK. Goodbye. Hello, Squick.",

Yes, I do. Well, I'm a football recruiter, so I travel all around the world to sign different football players for our sports management company. Just the independence about it being alone, being able to be free and not tied down to one thing, you know, it's great. I remember traveling to. And take them to clubs and this and that. We're not that type of organization. Yeah. This honesty. I don't like when people are dishonest. That really, really, really bothers me and not true, not honest, not real. That that upsets me a lot. I tend to just try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind. I usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head. I'm okay with it at times, but I can definitely be better. Oh, I argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school and she she wants to raise her one way. And I think I want to raise her a kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations. So I think different discipline is a big key in a kid's life and she she she was raised a little differently. I don't know, just angry, upset, you know, when you're in an argument, that's what you feel. So you do and say things that that that bother you and you just you go on with it. Yeah, a little bit. I don't know. I just just the way I feel. I don't know. I can't really say just the way I feel. A little, a little. I don't know, just realness. Honesty, truth, just being straight out front. I'm pretty close. I'm pretty close with my family. Oh, oh, another subject just they're raised different. I think society is going to become even wilder the way the kids are raised and no discipline and the things they're doing, everything we we they live in, everything inflated so much to where it's getting to a point where it's getting out of hand. I think kids these days to a certain extent are much wilder than I was and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and you know, just education wise. I think it's just tough times for kids and the way they act. It's it's ridiculous to me. I definitely like to watch sports. I like to gamble. I like to travel. I like to skate. I like kind of like a guy that likes to see different sites and go different places like that. I'm a big movie person so I like going to theater stuff like that. I'm actually living it. I always wanted to be in some kind of sports industry and that's what I'm doing now. I just my goal is to get a little higher in a ladder and in all my own sports management company, but I'm doing pretty well for myself so I'm happy. Yeah. No. No. No. Um, it's okay. It's pretty easy. Irritated. Tired. I don't know. It's been a while. It's been a while. A couple weeks ago. What did you say? No, not really. I think he would describe me as a stand up guy. I try to be a good loyal friend and an adult. I think he would describe me like that. School. Once school grew up together. I've been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life. Yeah. We're very close. My friends and I are very close. We pretty much do a lot together still at this age. I'm honest. I'm loyal. Very loyal. I'm an art worker. I think I am to a certain extent I'm just not the average guy. I'm pretty much I'm a different breed. I just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy. I think I learned that from him a lot. It's kind of the same path I took. A lot of things I regret. I regret a lot of decisions in my life. Yeah, one. I actually let a lady of my life go years ago that I felt was my soul mate. We had a big argument. One thing led to another. We decided to take a break. I started dating somebody else and I told her I'm going to go my way and she went her way. I think that was a bad decision. Very bad decision. Yeah, totally. I think I could have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of being so upset and moving forward. I'm just upset. I tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded. I need to think a little more when I'm upset. I don't know. Just experience the time. Make enough for your mistakes and being better about these decisions after you made the mistakes. Think a little harder about situations and things and the decisions that you make. Think a lot longer and harder before you make them and I think the outcome will be a little different today. My grandmother, she's always been a positive influence. She's a great black woman with old school ways of living. I think I've added that to my life. She's a great woman. She's a great woman. I was a pretty good player. I was a pretty good athlete growing up. I was one of the top. I had started a future in athletics and that's what I wanted to do so I accomplished my growth. At the time it was a great thing and still is a great thing. It's a great accomplishment in my life. Accomplishments. Being able to, if I have a goal or something I'm supposed to do that week or that day and I accomplish it always puts me in a good mood. Or getting my job done the way I'm supposed to do it in a timely fashion always puts me in a good mood. Being a positive role model right now for younger kids that's in our sports academy program. I think as I got older the thought process and the way I look at life has totally changed. I think a lot of kids can look up to me that I deal with now and say that's somebody that is a positive influence in my life.

Let's see if I can start you up. Oh, actually, before that, one thing I almost forgot, I have to do something that syncs our equipment. There we go. All right. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just creative to talk to you about the world and state and the spirit environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And if things feel free to tell me everything, the answers are within comprehension. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm all right. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Oh, really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? The lights, the big city. It's always something going on. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic and that's it. Okay. What's your study at school? Business administration and business management. Are you still doing that? Not that. I'm doing networking at the moment. What's your dream job? Hmm. To open up a big clothing line and just supply the whole world with clothing. That sounds interesting. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Definitely. Why? Because I'm all about myself. It's all about me. Do you feel that way often? Not often, but more times than not, yeah. What are some things that you do really like? Being lied to and I guess when people think you're dumber than what you are. I understand. What do you do when you're in life? I try to get away from everything. Go into my own space. How are you at controlling your temper? Very well. I'm great at controlling my temper. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? Probably two days ago. It was probably just over some sports. It wasn't a real argument. Okay. Do you travel a lot? Not a lot, but I travel enough. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just being able to get a change of pace. See somebody new, see new faces, new environment. I'd love to hear about your trips. Let me see. The last trip I had was Vegas. You know how Vegas goes. It was pretty fun. There was a lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on. Nice. What would you say of somebody that's following you? Pretty open-minded. I'm kind to pretty much everybody. I'm a pretty even-killed guy. How do you like your living situation? It's alright. It could be better. Do you have roommates? No. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No, ma'am. Have you ever been diagnosed with stethoscopy? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Lately it's been pretty tough. I guess because I haven't stand up so late. That's my fault. Why? I don't know. I guess I'm a night owl all of a sudden. I'm turning into an owl. Okay. What are you like when you're not sleeping well? Sluggish and tired all day if I don't sleep well. All day I'm just laying around. Have you ever stayed in a hotel room? No. Not too much. Okay. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay focused and listen to the adults. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. Listen to the adults. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Tell me more about that. I mean, self-exponential. I think I just listened to parents or other adults that tried to stare you in the right way. You know, you're being a stubborn kid at those ages. So it's like, what are you talking about? It's my life. I can do what I want. I don't have to listen to you. But now I'm a good sleeper. I can still listen to you. But now I see that what they were telling me was correct. Yeah. How are your best friends describing you? Um, hilarious. Okay. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. You're someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Both my parents, mother and father. That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Recently, what did I do? New Year's Eve party. I had the time of my life. It was so fun. I'd love to hear all about it. This New Year's Eve, I went to a party at a friend's house in Balling Hills area. He had it at a pretty nice house. It's a three story house. And it was like 350 people in there. It was pretty fun. But it was also not that fun because it was so many people and you couldn't really move. So that was the only downfall. I brought my New Year in great with tons of friends. That's how it's supposed to be done. Awesome. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, I'm generally in a good mood every day. I mean, waking up puts me in a good mood. I guess you could say that. I don't know. I don't know. A good meal. That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? One of my most memorable experiences were probably when I was younger. I was in a Boy Scouts and we used to go camping all the time. And then one year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite, one of those places. And we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge. And of course being from the city I'm like mountain biking. I can ride a mountain bike. But once we got into the real mountains and got on real mountain bikes, I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers. It was pretty, it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense. I'll never forget that. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a tough one to answer. What am I most proud of? I don't know honestly. Bye. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one.",

         " Alright, looks good. So let's move around just a little bit because we have an Xbox Connect that might use your motion. There we go. Picking you up just fine. Now I'm going to do something that syncs our equipment. Oh. Syncs your equipment. What does that mean? Basically it means the audio and the video can get together. Oh, so they'll be in harmony. Okay, alright, sounds good. So I'm going to pull up the virtual human, she's going to chat with you, and then when she's done, she'll let you know and you can go ahead and ring that doorbell and let me know that you're ready to go. Oh, okay. Alright, please. Hi, I'm Ellie. Okay. Okay. Los Angeles. Well, that's a good question. I like the familiarity with everything. I know where everything is in the city. That's all I can say right now. So spread out. So hard to get places. Is there anything else? My dream job. I don't think there is a dream job. For me, no, there isn't one. I'm sort of unemployed right now. So am I. And that's true. I started, I studied urban planning. Well, I think this school shooting thing and the NRA seeming to not want to budge on this gun control issue thing. That's it. I try to remove myself from that situation that's annoying me. I've been better over the years. Most of the time I just try to, you know, walk away or, you know, control my emotions in terms of, you know, just walking away. Just watch TV now. I would say my children being born. Well, I have four children. Each birth was special. And, you know, it was a unique experience each time. It's a lot easier now because they're all adults. But, you know, it was challenging. I would say senior children grow up to be successful and exceeding your expectations. You worry all the time. You worry for them. You know, now I'm not around them as much and I certainly worry about them. Then I saw my children. About a week ago. I'm usually pretty happy when I see them. You know, I'm interested. My girlfriend and insignificant. No. Around LA maybe, but that's about it. Excuse me. Why don't I travel? I don't have the funds to do that anymore. Or the health. No. Yes. Let's see about a year. Recognizing that there were some things in me that were wrong. I knew that there was something wrong if I wasn't myself. Well, you know, I was always tired and not excited about things anymore. Kind of lethargic, you know, laying around and just not feeling myself. About the same. Yes, I do. Once a month. Yeah, I do. I do. Well, it's, you know, it's, you know, I see a psychologist and we talk about things. I don't really want to elaborate in detail, but you know, it's, I seem to think that it's helpful. Well, I think. That's a hard question. Let's move on, please. I think it's a little bit irritable. Cranky. Yeah, it is. That's a good question. It's been a while. I'd say. Year and a half, maybe. I've lost a lot of stuff going on in my life. You know, I just lost my parent, my dad, my last parent. Just a lot of stuff going on. I'll leave it at that. Well, I still like sports, you know. I like to play soccer or something. It usually puts me in a good mood, particularly if my team wins. You know, I like USC. I have a nephew that's a freshman football player at USC. And I've been a children's football fan for 40 years. You know, I think I listen well and, you know, I'm pretty much honest and straightforward. That's a good question. I don't know. You'd have to ask her. Definitely my mother. But she's deceased now. She's been deceased 10 years, but she was definitely positive influence my entire life. No, I have many regrets. Too many to name and number. But, you know, it's, you know, you have the benefit of hindsight. Yeah, I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of kids. I'm very proud of them. It's been a pleasure. Okay. It went on a lot easier.",

         " Okay, this looks good. Great. Start this recording as well. Maybe something for our system. Now we start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. When she's done, she'll let you know. I'm going to put the doorbell right next to you. So when she's done, just let me know. Hi, I'm Ellie. I'm a student at the University of New York. I'm not a very good student, but I'm very learning about people. I'm a graduate of the University of New York. I like to do research and research. I'm a student here at the University of New York. I like to do research and research. Are you a student here at the University of New York? Yes. So, are you Indian? Okay. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from India. Why do you miss the land? Why do I miss the land? Why do I miss LA? When did you start? Oh, about 20 years ago. How often do you go back to LA? Once every 3-4 years. How did you get used to it? I mean, the first 6 months it was a little difficult. But then I got used to it and I feel very comfortable now. That's good. Are you comfortable? Yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? The food. Actually, I enjoy flying, then meeting different people, different scenes. Then I try to achieve my goals. I'm sorry? How did you get involved in the business? I used to run a business. I used to travel to meet people, to get orders. Traveling involved going to Northeast, Ohio and Pennsylvania, places like that. Meet top people to get orders for my business. I enjoyed listening to their problems. I used to take them out for dinner. I genuinely enjoyed talking to them. Many of them were open enough to tell me about their problems. But my main goal, main objective was to get the orders for the business. Nice. What do you do for a living? I cook, watch movies, meet friends, throw a party. What do you do now? I'm talking to you. What did you study before? I'm an engineer. I did mechanical engineering. I'm also an MBA. Are you still working on it? Actually, I branched off to finance. I trade stocks now. How did you get involved in the business? A friend of mine was making a lot of money in stocks. First, I used to interact with him. I realized he was making a lot of money. Then I did a formal course in it. I attended a lot of seminars. Lost a lot of money before I started making money. What do you do for a living? I watch movies, visit people, play basketball, do shopping, cook. How are you doing? I'm very good at controlling my temper. When was the last time you argued with your brother? The last time I argued was with my brother. It was about my dad. He's getting old. He lives in India. I was planning on bringing him here. My brother said it's going to be very expensive with respect to health bills. I was arguing with him that we should all pull in the money and get them here. They are quite old. I have a mom too. They are both old. How close are you with your family? I'm very close to my parents. Not so close with my brother and their family. Why? I tend to be judgmental. I think sometimes that my niece and nephew should have been brought up in a different way. My brother doesn't seem to think along the same lines. We have disagreements and that's the reason. Do you think it's going to happen? It is. Do you believe in their race? No, not at this time. What do you think is going to happen? What do I think of what? What do you think is going to happen? Can you repeat that one more time? What do you think is going to happen? I still couldn't follow you. What's the matter with you? Have you ever served in the army? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. How long ago were you diagnosed? About one to two years ago. What made you decide to go into the army? I was feeling down and I was not interested in things that I was normally interested in. I was sort of withdrawn and I was not able to focus on my things. I went to see a doctor and I ended up doing that. Did you ever have trouble sleeping? No. What made you decide to go into the army? I lost appetite. I was not sleeping well. I had difficulty concentrating and focusing. I was not getting my assignments done on time. These were some of the problems. How have you been doing lately? I've been feeling good. You've been doing yoga? No, I don't. Why didn't you stop doing yoga? I started doing yoga and I've been doing that for about a year. And meditation. That's helped a lot. Awesome. What made you decide to do it? It's just that when I was diagnosed with depression, I thought I shouldn't be taking any medication for it. I was looking at other ways to get over the problem. Then I realized some of my friends were doing meditation and I got influenced by them. How easy is it to get rid of depression? It's a little difficult. But I've been able to sleep within half an hour. There are days when it takes almost one or two hours to go to sleep. Are you better by sleeping? Are they what? Can you repeat that? Are you better by sleeping? No. What are you working on these days? When did you last do yoga? Okay. What are you most proud of? What am I proud of? I was among the top 2% in my MBA class. When I used to run my business, I designed a product that was working really well. I was happy that I was able to design something that was so useful for my business. How are your best friends? I'm thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly, very easy to get along with, very focused, very intelligent, and a good cook. Who's your best friend? Albert Einstein. Can you tell me about that? Some of his theories involve a lot of deep thinking. The first few times I read about him, about his theories, I had difficulty in really understanding that. When there are things that I really try to understand and I'm not able to, they're all the type of people I admire. What advice would you give yourself? I would say to be open to other people. What is the thing you like about yoga? It's diverse and I like the entertainment industry. I like the fact that there are more women than men here. There are certain areas where only Spanish is spoken. I would like for all people who come to America to be able to understand English and be able to speak in English so that everybody can participate. What is the thing you like about doing yoga? In LA? What is the thing you like about doing yoga? Some of the things the political leaders do really make me mad. Sometimes I think they're wasting their time, our time, and other countries are advancing. These guys don't get things done and I feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry. What advice would you give to people? The first four years of the Obama administration I think it was wasted because if Congress had acted together and got things done, then maybe we could have made it much more difficult for China to catch up with us. The fact that China is able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still argue and find faults with each other and not get things done. They don't seem to realize that the clock keeps ticking. They have to get things done. What's one thing that makes you feel bad? One thing that comes to my mind is that I made a lot of money once in Los Angeles. I remember that it happened during Christmas some 10 years ago and that made me very happy. What is something that makes you feel bad? Good music, good food, a party with friends that I like, and I also like cooking and I enjoy cooking with groups. Those are things that really put me in a good mood. What advice would you give to people? I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope it was worth your time. Thank you so much. You've been nice. Bye. Thank you.",

         " Okay, looks good. Do something for our purposes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Good. Chicago. It's cold in Chicago. Oh, I think in 90. 1989, actually. Oh, very simple. Very easy. Weather, of course. I'm so easily located to San Diego, Palm Springs, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and things I like to do. Smog, of course, is bad. Crime and retirement should be. And financial and economic problems here. Every year. Thanksgiving. Very, very much so. We're a very big family. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Very much in fact. I love flying on airplanes. I love visiting new places. I even like visiting different airports. Everyone's different. Oh, let's see. I started off in high school. I was in the pre-med. I ended up in physics. Yes, I teach physics. And math. My dad was a truant officer. And I've enjoyed it. It keeps you young. My dream job would be to be a judge. Yes, in the youth court. I'm not going to be able to do that. No. Not at all. I enjoy people. Being around people. I'm very talkative at times. I like to do a lot of things. I'm very social when I do them. Believe it or not, I play bridge. I play chess. And I watch a good old, old movie. Ooh. Bad drivers. Bad laws. Politics often. What do you do when you're annoyed? I really don't get annoyed that much. I just let it go. It's not worth the pain and problems it could cause. If I can't straighten out a problem, let it go. Go somewhere else. Always my bridge partner. But that's different. As far as anything else, I don't really argue with people. I don't like confrontation. My parents, of course. I had great parents. Can you tell me about that? My parents were at Tuskegee, which is a black college. They always want me to go to a black college, but of course I didn't want to do that. They're a very positive role model for me. I don't drink. I don't curse. I don't look down on people who do, but I don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things. I love to drive. I love to travel. My dad used to always take us someplace every weekend he was off. We'd go somewhere. We were in Chicago, Indiana, Michigan. Someplace in the area. We'd go to Michigan and pick fruit. We'd go to puppy farms in Indiana, that kind of thing. I had an uncle who lived in Wisconsin who was a dairy farmer. My dad used to love to drive, and I love to drive also. That's a hard one. I've had a lot of great experiences. I think the best one was we went, for my anniversary we went to Europe. We went to Paris. We rode the Orient Express. We didn't go all the way to Istanbul. We went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris. That was probably the best experience I've ever had in my life. I've never really cared for Europe because there's so much here in the United States to do and so much in America. I've been to Alaska and Hawaii, but we said we'd do something different. We'd always want to go on the Orient Express. We did that. Expensive, but a phenomenal trip. You've got to do it once. It's a once trip. Not once in a lifetime, just once. Not traveling more sooner. There are a lot of things we should have probably done we didn't do. We always went to Chicago on Thanksgiving, but I think we should have gone more than just on Thanksgiving. My parents come here around Christmas time, but I think we should have done a lot more when it comes to that. Yes, that's why it's a regret because it could have been avoided. We could have done a lot more things we could have done and we would have spent our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us. I think that people... Oh yes, very definitely. That's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago. I would have said don't take things too seriously, but don't be too relaxed over them either. Sometimes you can take things for granted. Never take anything for granted. Nothing's promised. Oh, heaven forbid. No, I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Very, very easy. I really have no problem with that. Once in a while. If I'm anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due, then I get kind of anxious a little bit. I don't like to be late. I don't like to make mistakes. Therefore, I do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that everything is right. What are you like when you're just being blown? Tired. I don't get irritable or anything. I'm just nostalgic maybe. I'm just a little bit. How have you been feeling lately? Very good. I was up late last night, so I'm kind of tired now. I usually have no problem sleeping. I get a good night's sleep. I just came back off a Christmas break. I should be very relaxed now. What are you most proud of in your life? I have great kids. I have a son at USC. I have a son at UCLA. My daughter just got married. I'm really proud of my kids. They're going to have a good life. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I enjoyed it. I still enjoy it. Being a parent is forever. What's the best thing about being a parent? Taking care of someone else and getting them started off to have a good life. I think that that's rewarding. Making sure everything is covered. That needs to be covered with your kids. Whether it's their eating, their sleeping, their clothes, their dress, make sure they're content. Make sure they have no problems at school or at home. Physically, mentally, spiritually, everything. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend would say she has not changed since high school. Level-headed, but a great sense of humor. Relaxed. I don't take things too seriously. When was the last time you felt really happy? I love the holidays. I love Christmas. I love everything about it. I love preparing the house for it. I love baking and cooking. Especially baking. I love experimenting with new recipes. The last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here, I felt fantastic. Everything is quiet. I'm not at work. I'm not stressed out in any way at all. I have no projects to do. I have to think about it anyway. Christmas time. Holiday time. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I really enjoyed it recently. Well, Christmas of course. We went to Las Vegas on the 27th of December. That was fantastic. We only stayed for two days. We had a really good time. We saw a great show. We had some great food. We drove there. We don't usually drive. I don't like to drive a lot, but we drove there and just took our time. That sounds like a great situation. It was good. It was nice. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye. Thanks for listening. How's that one? Okay. I have to ring the bell. My mind is wandering. Here we go. Hi there. Okay. Actually, before I do that, let me see if I can get the mic on. Okay.",

Who's someone that's been a positive employee? My family. I'd love to hear all about it. My mother. She's a very good-hearted person. Gives me good advice. That's good. What are some things you like to do for fun? Oh, pretty close. Yeah. Family comes first. Family's number one. Yeah. What are some things you like to do for fun? Go to the gym. You know, exercise. Go to the beach. Party every once in a while. Watch basketball, football. Okay. Take trips. Go to Vegas. What's the last time you had that? Which one? Went to the gym last night. I have friends that live in Vegas, so I go there often. Enjoying the travel? I just take a trip, get out. Get away from the city for a minute. But I'm a city boy, so it can't be way too long. You know, head up the city. What do you do to relax? I don't go to the beach. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, that's been a problem over the years. What's the only thing you worry about? I don't know. I just have a little anger, I guess. Anger management problem. When was the last time you had a problem with someone? Probably only yesterday. I forget what it was about. What do you do when you're in life? I go to the gym. What are some things that will be really annoying? People. Tell me more about that. I don't know, just people. Just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes. Okay. What's your dream job? Dream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Plan Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far, the past 10 years. Then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX. I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA Airport. Nice. What's one thing that most number of people experience? What, working at the airport? I guess during the holidays there was some girl that worked there. I had a crush on her, but she turned out to be a lesbian. She's beautiful. Yeah. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. Have you been diagnosed with a disease? I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No. Why did you stop? I just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped. I'm sorry you're late. No problem. It's not your fault. Do you think it's their disease? Excuse me? Did your parents just help you? It wasn't when I was a teenager. Tell me more about that. What, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know? How have you been doing lately? I'm not going forward as fast as I want to. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is. Have you done anything to avoid it? To avoid what? Going forward? I guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would. Excuse me? Yeah, I guess. Are there? Yeah, it's like mood swings, I guess. Mood swings? Are you triggered by something? It could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know? When was the last time you had a mood swing? Oh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today. Really? How did you fool around with me? Angry. How hard is it? Yeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know? Do you think you're going to be able to control it? No. Okay. How are your best friends? My best friends? My best friends? Excuse me? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? The goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted. That's great. Thank you. Is that even your address? Yeah. Yes. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then. What made you decide to do that? To do what? To do what? Let's come back to that earlier. When was the last time you were in the house? I don't know. Today. Happy to be here. That's great. What are some things that you really put into your life? Um, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah. What would you say is something you've best followed in? My best qualities? Just that, uh, qualities. Just that I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What do you mean by qualities? What comes to your mind? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay. I think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay, bye. Can I take her home with me? Is she, um, is she supposed to be a psychiatrist or can I hire her? Okay.",

         " Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. I'm fine. This is a little bit strange, you know, talking to a virtual human. I was born, I was born in LA. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived in the city of San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I was born in LA. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived all over Los Angeles. I've lived in the valley, Long Beach, and now I'm in Culver City. Awesome. What are some things you really like about LA? There's great food here. The weather is great most of the time. There's a lot of sunshine. I think that's really great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? That is a much longer list I would like to get out of here. The traffic, I think that's number one. I think everybody hates the traffic. And everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to get together with anybody. Everybody's so devoted to their jobs and then we're sitting in traffic a lot too. Yeah. What did you study at school? I studied Marine Biology. Wow. That sounds interesting. Why did you decide to do that? I went to school and I originally studied graphic design and I found that kind of unfulfilling. So I took a trip for a while, traveled around the world, and started scuba diving. And I realized that I really loved Marine Biology. So that's how I got into it. Nice. What's your dream job? Everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since I just graduated. I think I would like to... I think maybe managing a research... I'm not really sure. I think I would like to... Something in Tropical Marine Ecology, maybe managing a preserve, something like that. It's a hard question to answer. I do. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I traveled for eight months in Central America. And I visited a lot of different countries. I... I traveled a lot. I traveled a lot. I went to different countries. I went scuba diving. Wow. What are some things that you're doing now? I think intolerance, injustice in the world. I think intolerance, injustice in the world. Those are probably the things that get me the most fired up. What do you do when you're annoyed? Brant to my boyfriend. Does that count? How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. Very few people have seen me angry. To the point where I'm kind of yelling and screaming angry. I don't know. I just don't get there. I think that I'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper, so I keep it under control. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone you loved or loved without? It was yesterday, actually. I argued with my boyfriend about getting a job. I was talking about taking a job somewhere, and he was being very supportive. I really wanted him to say, No, don't go take that job for six months because I would miss you. He was just being supportive. We kind of argued about that. It was ridiculous, so I ended up laughing. That's good. What do you do to relax? Meditate, exercise, go out in nature. Just unplug, get myself away from a computer, away from technology, away from people. Okay. How close are you to your family? I would say not really. I'm an only child, and it's just me and my parents, and we're very, very dissimilar. For example, I'm a pretty adventurous person. I like learning, and my parents are couch potatoes. They like to watch reality television. We don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activities. I love them and everything, but there's not too much common ground. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Yes. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I don't think I'm a social person. I think I'm a social person. I think I'm a social person. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I seem to find most social encounters to be draining, whereas my boyfriend, for example, he derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people. For me, it's always a little bit the opposite. I have to recharge. How are your best friends? I'm not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He's kind of my best friend. I'm not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He would probably say passionate, intelligent. He always tells me that I'm really hard on myself, which is true. Dedicated, loyal. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm just proud of who I am. I don't know if that's the answer that most people give, but I think that I'm really proud of who I am. I try really hard. I've done a lot of things in my life. I'm a really good person. I think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind, and I consider myself a kind person that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so I'm proud of that. That's so good to hear. Have you ever served in military? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I was probably about 15 at the time, so I think 17 years ago. You were very young weren't you? Yes. What got you to see the doctor? I was diagnosed with depression. I called my parents and let them know, and at that point they took me in for treatment. That wasn't the first time I had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist, but before it was more, they thought I had ADHD. So it was, I think, my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help. Do you still go to therapy now? I haven't for about three years. I was checking in with a parole officer. I just wasn't enjoying the relationship I had, but I still have a psychiatrist that I go to for med checks. That sucks. Do you feel like they're useful? I do think it's useful if you have the right therapist. I think if you don't have a good relationship with a therapist, it can be incredibly harmful. I have talked to people that have had bad experiences How have you been feeling lately? Lately I've been a little bit down. I should say a little bit more down than usual because I graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things 24-7 has come to an end. Without the routine, it's been a little bit weird finding out what to do with my... finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time. It's also been a little bit depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in California. That sounds really hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Almost impossible. Ever since I was a little kid, I had trouble falling asleep. About four years ago, it became really, really bad or I just couldn't sleep through the night. I was getting about four hours of sleep. Sometimes I would wake up every hour and I would wake up in the morning just to complete rec. For about four years, I've been taking trazodone so I can sleep. What are you looking down for these days? Have you ever seen Fight Club? You're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's pretty much like that. I'm just a complete panicked, anxious rec. I lose my ability to deal with things. I'm much more likely to lose my temper. I can't regulate my moods. I'm just really volatile. When was the last time you were happy? Probably a few months ago. I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a week, and I was just really, really happy. I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a weekend, and forgotten to take my medicine with me or something like that and then I can't sleep and so that's what happens. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy. I don't know. It's easier for me to keep track of when I feel really, really bad. Really happy. I guess I felt happy on New Year's Day and really happy on New Year's Eve, which was 10 days ago. I was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to Palm Springs and Joshua Tree and it was really nice to see them. I don't get to see them very often because I've been in school and I've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to real life. That's great. What would you say as somebody who has followed you? I think that I'm kind, I'm considerate, I'm tolerant, I'm pretty open-minded, I'm aware of my faults. I just try to be nice to everybody and I'm very curious about the world and things that I don't know about. I really like to learn. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think that I was in a relationship with my boyfriend and he was really nice to me What's one of your most memorable experiences? Off the top of my head, first thing that comes to mind is diving the blue hole in Belize. It was really amazing. It was me and my friends. We just jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this limestone sinkhole and it's really, really, really blue and you just drop down to about 140 feet in something like two minutes. We did it pretty quick, not everybody could do it that quick. As you go down, you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge, they're larger than a human because it's this cave system and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you. That was pretty good. What are some things you like to do for fun? I'm trying to remember that at the moment. I haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school. I guess reading, hiking, just being together with my friends, doing relatively low key things, going to movies, having dinner parties, cooking, playing with my cat. Is there anything you can remember? Not that I can really think of. I've made mistakes in my life, but I'm still here so it can't be that bad. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't know, hang in there. Hold on to your clothes because the 90s are coming back in fashion. What are some things that you believe have been a good way? There's someone that's been a positive influence on you. I think that's great. Especially the last year, he's really inspired me. He quit drinking, he quit smoking. He's made a lot of positive changes in his life. I know that those things aren't easy. So to see someone overcome that really inspired me. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thanks for having me.",

What are you enjoying about traveling? Um, the different sceneries, different period, different. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Which one? Europe? France? Yeah, it was cool. It was great, learning different languages and seeing different cultures and different people. It's enlightening, mind expansion, definitely. That sounds like a great situation. Hmm, to say the least. What was your most memorable experience? Berlin Wall. How did you feel about Berlin Wall? Uh, overwhelmed. Why? Because it was atrocities and stuff that went down during that war. I think you know. How easy is it for you to get into the next stage of your life? Man, that's a good question. Depends.

Maybe when I was flying last, flying in a private plane, I guess. You know, there's no reason to get super, super, super happy. And I guess if you're married, hopefully that'll make you super happy.

You can just ring the doorbell when she's done talking. Yes. Fine, thank you. Montreal, Canada. I moved here with my mom when I was in high school. Yes. Oh, it's very cold there in the winter and our summers are very short. It was very easy. I custom pretty quick. No, not very much anymore. I don't have much family in the United States. It's pretty expensive to go back home so I only go every couple of years. Meeting different people, different places, different customs. Well, we just recently went to San Francisco, same custom and everything, but the city was very different and I enjoyed it. I took general education and child development. Right now I work part-time for an independent auto repair shop. I'm a very good driver. I'm a very good driver. I'm a very good driver. I work part-time for an independent auto repair shop. Just working with people, talking to people. No. I'm shy sometimes so I stay to myself a lot. I walk along the beach, bike riding. Arrogant people. I try not to get angry but sometimes I do try to learn. I'm learning to walk away from things but sometimes people provoke you. I'm getting better. I'd say 75% under control. About a month ago with my daughter and her finances. It's really hard. You don't like arguing with your children. I have two girls. One is 23 and one is 26. One lives in Louisiana and one lives here. Now that they're older, yes. Satisfaction of giving love to someone else. Worry. Well, unfortunately when I was young my sister was kidnapped so when my children were growing up I worried about them a lot and I didn't let them do things a lot on their own. Now it's easy because they're grown and they live on their own so it's a lot easier now but you still worry even though they're grown. I'm sorry, what did you say? Oh my goodness, they're spoiled rotten. They have everything. Waking up when my kids were younger on Christmas Day I loved it. No. Yes. It's been exactly two years and two months. Loneliness, depression, especially after I didn't have any family members left in the United States so I went to counselor and then the group therapy. Yes. I mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your likes, your dislikes, your problems and sometimes somebody else is going through the same thing you are and you can share what you're going through and what can help make it better. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It's affected me a lot. It's helped me cope with things. It's nice to have somebody else to talk to. Yes, I didn't want to admit it but after a while and feeling depressed for so long I knew I had to do something. How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just getting more positive, better. That's good. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's not. It's about 50-50. Some nights I sleep good and some nights I don't. That sucks. What are you likely to do to improve on? Lack of energy the next day. How hard is that? It's hard, especially if you get two nights in a row of no sleep. Wow. When was the last time you felt really happy? During the holidays, so a couple of weeks ago. How did you feel about the holidays? I felt good. Holidays always try to, you know, Christmas trees and kids and everything. So usually is a good time makes me feel good. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? I was married and raising two children and having two kids. I'm very proud of that. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoy. Wow. That's great. Thanks. How did you decide to decide? Well, I went from full-time to part-time work and there's not as much work in the automotive field. So I decided to go back to school. Easygoing, fun, easy to get along with. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mom. She's raised four kids single-handedly and was a very hard worker. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't give up. Be positive and anything you try to accomplish, Ken, you can do it. Is that anything you regret? Not going back to school sooner. Have you done anything to avoid it? No, because I was raising two kids by myself. So now that they're grown, I have no excuse. So I'm doing it. That's good. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm friendly. I'm a hard worker and most of the time I'm easy to get along with. Can you tell me about that? Like I said, I'm a hard worker. If you give me work to do, I'll do it. Most of the time I'm in a good mood so I'm easy to get along with. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Like I say, bike riding or walks on the beach. The beach is very relaxing. That's so good to hear. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, okay.",

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions at the start, and please feel free to tell me that. Your answers are really confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty well. That's good. Where are you from originally? From New York. Really? Why did you move to LA? To go to college. Well, to San Diego to go to college, and then later to LA. Cool. What did you study at school? Aerospace engineering. That's nice. How did you decide to do that? I was really good at math and science, and I had an interest in airplanes. Are you still working on that? No. What do you do now? I'm a life coach. Cool. What's your dream job? To be a life coach and help people. Tell me more about that. I really like how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that I made a contribution to their life. That's so good to hear. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. It's great. I really like to do outdoor things, and I like doing things by the ocean. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic and how crowded it is. Do you have roommates? Yeah. How do you like your living situation? I live with my girlfriend, so I like it. How do you know them? We met on eHarmony. How close are you to them? Really close. That's great. There's someone that's been a positive influence on you. My meditation teacher. Can you tell me about that? I used to be very shy and self-conscious and have a lot of anxiety. I worry a lot about the future. I took classes, meditation and yoga classes, and it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and enjoy life a lot more. That's good. What do you do to relax? I meditate and do yoga. What are some things that you don't really like about LA? I don't get mad that often, but frustrated. I would say being stuck in traffic or people that do mean things to other people for no real reason. What do you do when you're annoyed? I usually talk to somebody about it if I can. That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? When was the last time you argued with someone? How did you feel about that? What did you do in that moment? Do you feel that way often? That's good. What are some things you like to do to find? What's one of your most memorable experiences? A trip I took to India and Nepal for six weeks. Can you travel a lot? Yeah, as much as I can. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love to explore. I've loved to explore ever since I was a little kid. I love seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures. I love backpacking in the wilderness and exploring nature. I'd love to hear about your trips. Cool. I went on a trip to India and Nepal. It was my first time ever there. The first week and a half I was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat. I went whitewater rafting on the Ganga River. Then I went off on my own for the rest of the trip. I went backpacking in Nepal with a guide there. It was really beautiful in the Annapurna area. Then I went back into India and explored the area up near Tibet. Then I went to Rajasthan and to a tiger park in Madai Pradesh. It was really close to tigers. How did you decide to do that? I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this trip. I'd always wanted to go to India. So I decided to do it. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was really fun. How are your best friends? They're caring and enthusiastic for life. That's good. Have you ever served in a military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with insomnia? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I don't sleep as well as I did when I was younger. For the most part, I sleep well. Once in a while, I'll wake up at four or five in the morning when I want to sleep until seven. I'll not be able to get back to sleep. In general, it's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I feel tired and not as motivated as usual. I sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon. Okay. Have you ever studied using a video app? No. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago? I guess, too, I wish I would have invested money or bought a house or something when I was younger. That would probably be the advice I would give myself. Okay. What would you say is one of your best qualities? I am empathetic with other people, positive and have a positive outlook on life. I'm very determined when I decide to do something. I'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging. I'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things. I guess probably the strongest thing is that I'm pretty balanced. I'm very organized but I'm also pretty creative. I'm pretty balanced that way. That's good. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. Much closer than I was when I was younger. Although I'd say I'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than I'm able to get to my family. Okay. What are some things that you do that you think are good? Being outdoors and nature and exercising and also singing. What are you most proud of in your life? The fact that I've gone with, followed my heart and done what I wanted to do versus going with what I think I should do. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? I guess yesterday. I spent the day by the beach and just bicycled and went skating and visited some old friends there. How did you feel about that? I felt very relaxed and invigorated. I also felt like I missed living by the beach because I used to live really close to the beach. I guess a little bit sad that I didn't live there anymore but really happy to be there. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Goodbye. Okay.",

How do you know that? Who? Let's see now. Yes. No. No. But... Well, I don't really consider myself an introvert. Yeah. I have a lot of I have a lot of regrets. But there really wasn't anything I could do about it. So there's really no point in regretting it. Cause you do what you do and you make a decision and then it's already done so why regret it? Why bother? You know? What advice can you give yourself? Make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol. That's one for sure. That was the only question I didn't ask. I didn't know. There's a lot of things. A lot of stuff. You know? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Just the things that I can do. That my talents, that's it. Why do you think you need to do something like that? Why do you think you need to do something like that? Um... Well, if I can have my Starbucks and my Orange Gina. I drink Orange Gina every day. I smoke cigarettes unfortunately but it's always good to have those because I'm addicted to them. And then if I can eat something really good and healthy at night time and... Well basically if I have something to do if I have a goal, somewhere to go, something to do, like today even puts me in a good mood. Yeah. Otherwise I'd be afraid that I'd stay home and just lay in bed or farm all day. I could farm for 8 hours on Farmville. Yeah. Okay. I think that's all for me. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So I press the button. Okay. You're good. She's good. Except for you know, it's like the one eye... Can she hear me by the way? The one eye always kind of moves weird. Oh does it? Yeah it's kind of distracting. Yeah the one... Yeah. Yeah she kind of made a mistake on one part.",

         " collection. Now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. I'm going to put the doorbell back over here. When she's done, she'll let you know and you can hit the doorbell. Okay? Alright. Okay. Yes. Very well. New York. This turned the volume up a little bit. For a change. That's good. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was about. Probably took a year or two. Well, you know, being away from my family, being away from what I was used to in New York, the neighborhoods, the people, and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here. Well, the weather. Can't beat the weather. It's generally always nice. It's not too hot. It's not too cold. It's creative. I do like movies. I like the beach. The traffic. There's a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places. I was a history major. I do demonstrations in high-end supermarkets. To be a screenwriter. That's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. It's hard because I don't always maintain focus and motivation. I let other things distract me. I've always been interested in films ever since I was a child. I just always was writing and had an active imagination. In the last probably almost ten years I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well, I've always traveled, even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So, yes. Seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am. Seeing how they live and taking in the sights. I went to Kenya. That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on. On the safari and just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible. Oh yeah, that's one of the great experiences of my life. I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called Charmel Shake, which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world, which is hard to believe that Egypt would, but it was just amazing. I didn't go scuba diving. I went snorkeling. What do I do to relax? I like to listen to music. I like to watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of whatever might be on my mind. I do meditate every day. I like to take walks in nature that's always calming, especially down by the ocean. It depends. Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper. A lot of times I'll do a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself, which is something I've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. Also, since I meditate, I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past. Some things that make me really mad. I guess I think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along and make the world better. What was the last thing you argued with someone? Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film and I didn't think it was done very well. We had a fun argument about the movie. That just happened yesterday, so that's on my mind. Is there anything you regret? Is there anything I regret? Yeah, there have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued them. Certain jobs. When I first got to Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to become a GRIP and I probably should have pursued that. How did I decide to do that? I don't really understand the questions. Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important and no matter how you feel, you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do. No, but I've been depressed in my life. For the most part, I've been feeling good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. Sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down. I can usually get out of it pretty quickly. Sometimes financial concerns, sometimes an opportunity, how do I explain it? Financial is one way that if I made another decision, I might have more money or my life would be different. Not really. I feel pretty much the same. What got me to seek help for? Let's come back to that. Generally, talking to someone has helped when I did do that. Pretty easy. I don't have problems sleeping. Usually I'm grumpy. If I don't sleep well, I feel tired and irritable. How would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier. I think it's tough, it depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write, so that means that I have to spend time alone. When I come out of that, I'm extroverted. I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood. My best qualities. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likeable personality. People have said that. I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's a cool detachment. I'm creative, intuitive. Yes. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy. I had breakfast, I was happy. Sun was shining. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I do remember snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun, the powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond, almost beyond like human in a way. Just more in touch with everything, the universe. It would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day, but... What am I most proud of in my life? I think I've helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, I've written some screenplays, I've had some good relationships. Good relationships, just being connected with someone else, spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels. It could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something. If I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive, it puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye bye. Sometimes she would ask me, it would sort of tweak, and then it would ask me this question about not being able to do it. I don't remember it really getting specific like that. Oh, like what? Do you remember what question you're talking about? It kind of asks me, well, are you depressed? Sometimes. It will explain that, and then it was like, well... Then it did something, and then it was like, well... Did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, we... There was no bridge to that conversation. Got it, got it.",

         " So, now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. And I'll give you the number bell to let me know. Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are welcome. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from a suburb of LA, from the San Gabriel Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity of the city. I've lived other places and it's just not as happy here. I feel like I can really thrive here. So I just like LA. Like all the things that are so close together. And there's a lot of interesting things that are totally different parts of the city, just miles away from each other. Yeah. I see. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. I don't like all the cars. But I can live with it. There's not that much I don't like. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied music, vocal performance, I studied music technology, things like that. Awesome. Are you still working on that? Yes. What do you do now? Right now I sing at an opera company. But I do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the LA Opera. So I do have a day job. I work at a call center. They cater mostly to performers and actors and things like that. It's really good because if I get a call, I can call in and change my shift very easily. So it's actually a pretty good gig. I do some technology gigs sometimes. I do some recording, some live sound stuff. But I kind of want to get away from that. I do some video work sometimes. But again, I want to get away from that. I want to go back to the... Because I find that performing is more interesting. I like being talent more than I like being crew. So I kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Sometimes. I mean, for my personal life, yeah. I do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people. But if I'm at home, I'd kind of rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever. I don't have too many close friends. But yeah, you know, I'd rather keep to myself. How close are you to your family? I'm moderately close to the family that I have left. I've actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so. Thank you. But I'm close to my husband. You know, I've got a couple of cousins I talk to and my aunt that I have an aunt that I talk to a bit. But it's not like we're interacting every day close together. But it's somewhat close. Okay. What do you do to relax? Mostly I sing or I read or I write or just hang out and try to... I hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in. And sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things, contacting my family, you know, through Facebook or whatever works. But mostly in my free time I create things. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I'd like to travel more. I like to travel by car a lot. I mean, my idea of having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. And I'd like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Particularly traveling by car, seeing the landscape change, seeing people change, feeling the vibrations of the area change. I like just seeing what's out there. And I know that there's a bigger world outside of where I am and where I live and my world. I like to see that. But I like to leave that too and go back to my own world. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Um, let's see. I think a trip that I like to take is to make the drive from here to Nevada, whether I go all the way to Vegas or just go to State Line. My cousin and I would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway, you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway. So we would take those. We just sort of impromptu with a day or two notice, just move things around, just take off. So those are actually trips that I like to make because I take off and then just come back. Sometimes the same day, sometimes overnight. Just small, short trips that aren't very involved, but you just get to go and you see things and see how, um, you know, the desert landscape looks in different seasons, how people react in different times of the year in different areas. So close to home, but not, but not close to home, close to home, but still a world away. So that because I don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever, but it's just little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head and things like that. I mean, because there's sort of a sense of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway. So I like doing that. The last time that happened was May of last year. So last time I was able to do that. We actually, my aunt came over with my cousin who's 10 years younger than I am. And we kind of grew up like sisters. And I was about to move away from the Inland Empire, which is where they live. So they kind of took me on a last hurrah. We drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while, but I didn't like it. So they kind of, I showed them some of the local sites around there and we came back and was, you know, an overnight trip, but we're driving the entire time. That's kind of interesting. Things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals or people who can't fight back. They're mean to them just because they can't fight back. And I actually like to see people who are as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you. So I think that's one thing that makes me really mad. Just being cruel or mean for no reason. You know, not for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it. That kind of really just makes me mad. When I'm annoyed, I'll try to just walk away from the situation. And if the situation is just unfollowing me, then I'll wind up lashing out somehow, either verbally just cutting them with a quip or, you know, I rarely will yell at somebody. But I'll try to, you know, if I try to walk away and defuse it, if that doesn't work, then I'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me. That usually works. Not like legal trouble or anything, because usually I'll find a way to get them to leave me alone. There's not really like big trouble, but I think because it is off-putting and it's not the expected reaction. And that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that will work and get people away from me. So it's not really in trouble. And if it is trouble, it's usually trouble that it's from the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because due to the situation I can get out of. So as long as they leave me alone, you know, I'll walk away from it. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody, like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my... What was that in your mind? The last thing I could think of was I argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law because she's got dementia. And so one of the reasons we came out here from the Inland Empire was to take care of her because she won't go anywhere but LA. I mean, she's like hardcore Angelino. We know we are that, we're that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere. But so we came out here to take care of her and he wants her to be able to stay in her apartment. And I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us. But she wants to stay where she is because she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process. But he wants her to stay where she... He wants her to be able to have what she wants because he's a mama's boy like I am. I'm a mama's girl. Even though I lost my mom like four years ago, I'm still a mama's girl. And I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much. That's what they want. So you want to get it for them. And because they, you know, that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it. And you want to do that for them now, like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about, somebody you feel deserves it. But it's kind of dangerous for her, you know, and I don't want this thing to happen to her. Yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as she can. Because I know the disease that she has is going to erase who she is eventually. And eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her 24 hour medically trained care. But until then, we can handle it amongst ourselves. It's not that bad. But it's getting worse. She really has no business living by herself anymore. So the solution right now is he stays there most of the time with her. And I go back to our house. And it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I do I handle the outside things. I run the errands. I take her to the store, things like that. He does the day to day things, make sure she has she eats, make sure she, you know, has clean clothes, things like that. So, I mean, it's a partnership. It's a it's a dual effort. It's very much a dual effort. But I would like her to move in with us. So that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling, screaming argument, but lively discussion, you know, and debate. It's not insurmountable. I mean, life's not going to be easy ever. And if it is, it's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life, it's not going to be easy. But you deal with it and you move on. The most positive influence, I think, have been probably my mother and my grandmother, because my mom was pretty much a single mom. And my grandmother helped raise me. And they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it. So, I mean, I think I have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperament to myself. But they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that, you know, life's going to go on. You know, my mom would say to me, when you're 40, you're 40, whether you're working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life. I think that was a big influence on how I've lived my life since she's passed. I regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have clouded some of my decisions. Now, I do have underlying conditions. Everybody in my family is diabetic, and I didn't take care of that when she was the last year for life because I was too busy wanting to get her home. My focus was to get her home. So I didn't eat right. I didn't take my insulin right. I wanted to make myself insulin resistant that year just because my blood sugar was so high for like a year. Eating just horrible foods when I did eat. So it really took a toll and it really actually made myself very sick. And I'm wondering, well, if I didn't, if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straight, my vision and my thoughts weren't completely weren't clouded. Would I have made some better decisions on her behalf, especially when she needed them? When she needed me to be to step in and make this his for because she wound up having a health catastrophe because she had kidney, she had kidney damage. I want to be kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that. So she wanted having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. She wanted having a stroke at like 50. She had a small stroke and it just kind of went down from there. So I'm thinking, well, if I didn't, if I had taken care of better care of myself, would I have been able to take better care of her? And I know there wasn't anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death. But what if I if I would I have been able to make it easier on her? If I would have taken care of myself. That's like one huge regret that I have. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Oh, I know I am. But it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And I know other people, I can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings. And they can't, you know, be what I want them to be. And I know they're not going to be. But I still have, you know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to. Fit into my life in a way in the best way possible. But I know because they're other beings. And I'm not going to be able to do that for them. Then I can be able to do that for me. But it's still by ideals. So I have to sometimes have to look at and go, well, is this what I want? Because I want it or what is what they want and what's there is their decision or mine and it's theirs. I know it's there. So if you really care about somebody, you're just going to support them and go with them. But it's still kind of hard for me. And I know I got to get over it. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago. Probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because I went up taking care of my mother. I mean, she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college and I had a job lined up and I had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her. I think I would have been more aggressive about starting my own life, getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her, getting my own job history, my own credit history, things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years. So I think I probably would have done that. But to myself, just do that and keep who you are and learn to separate. You who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of yourself. That's probably what I would have and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself. That's probably the advice I would give myself 10 years ago. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, but probably because I haven't gone to a doctor about it because I don't want to know. I mean, it's not, I know there have been times in my life where I've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it, but I'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. Can you give me an example of that? After my mother had died, it had been this long battle for a year that we lost. I didn't know if I was to blame for that. It's like logically I knew I wasn't, but how could I convince myself of that? Two weeks after she died, I wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because I didn't take care of myself for a year. I feel, oh, I'm 30 years old. If, you know, whatever I do to myself, I can get over. No, turns out no. But I wound up having to take more medication because of that. It's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter. All of a sudden I didn't. It's like the rug was pulled out. My like bottom fell out of my world after that. So that was the pretty pretty much sent me into a deep depression. I'm I almost got divorced because of it because I just didn't want anything anymore. So I was being really distant from my husband by then. At that time, we were married for about two years at that point, and I started getting very distant from him, just pushing everything away, just, you know, figuring out what am I going to do with the rest of my life now? And it's been a fight. And there are times when, no, I couldn't get up. Just stay in bed and sleep all day. You know, but then you realize that when my mother died, I had forecast look after two are mine to rehearse. I mean, well, they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own, you know, own supplies. I took that responsibility of doing it for them. So that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them. I mean, I could go without eating. I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't. They didn't, you know, so they actually got me up and. And made me go out and face things, even though I didn't want to, just didn't just kind of want to curl up and die. But that would have been my choice, not theirs. And they I mean, what would happen to them if I wasn't there to take care of them? They would have been, you know, sent to a shelter or whatever, probably. And maybe they would have not been re adopt me home and adopted by somebody else. Maybe they would have been killed for for me. I mean, for me making selfish decisions. So it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed. And that's actually been a motivating factor is to take because I figured out that it was just me. I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff. I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted. It wouldn't be a big deal. I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life. But I have a family to look after now. So I have to go out and do things. You know, I have to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day, day job. I have to, you know, but I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what I want to do with my life. But yet I have to take care of my family. Some work on a balance of the two. Very. But it's worth it. I mean, it would be very I'd have a lot less things to worry about if I just lived in my car and said, forget it. But keeping a residence down, paying bills, things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it. You know, if you want you want any if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through that. And I know that. But it gets hard. Sometimes you do want to give up. But then it's like, well, what's the alternative? I mean, I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did, I wouldn't do anything. I have to be slightly uncomfortable or I'm not going to do anything with myself. I'm just going to be content. Just hang out all day, stay in bed, hang out with my cats or whatever. And I wouldn't get anything done. I see. How do you even feel? Very anxious and nervous. And I mean, what if. I don't find enough, you know, enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever. What if? You know, what if I can't. Keep. Assemblance of stability in my life, and it's actually hard work to be stable. And I know it's hard work to be stable, but what you know, it's just a lot of what ifs. And I don't think it's things that haven't happened. And it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened. And I know that, but it's still have it still creeps in. So that's actually a source of. Anxiety. The internal anxiety go by getting things done, figuring things out, making a solid plan and going for it. But I know it's a cycle and I'll go from being really anxious and oh, my God, what am I going to do? What am I going to do? Just saying, OK, what is. The fundamental thing I need to take care of here. I mean, what is just extraneous and what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue? And so. Figure out how to figure things out that way. And then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit, but then something will pop up and the what ifs will come up again. I'll have to. Figure it out again, but I know it's a cycle. I know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it, you get over it pretty quickly. You get through it. The last time I felt really happy. I don't know. Like. Huh. Good question. But that actually surprisingly stumped me. Because I do feel happy sometimes, sometimes not so much. Sometimes it's kind of in the middle. Really like over joyously happy. I don't know. I have not. I can't think of when that happened. I don't know. I don't know. You don't know perceptions of other people. I mean. Probably as somebody who. Oddly enough, somebody who is laid back and you know. Handle things as they come, but I don't see myself as that at all. And so it. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to. Hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to to survive and get things done. That. And I can do it creatively and I try to. Strive for balance. Probably. Probably the best things about me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? That I'm doing basically what I want with my life, which even though it's not all easy, it's not. I'm not financially well off or anything. It's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives because I have an aunt that I really don't talk to who and the reason why I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable. I mean, she's got a career that she. It's more of a job that she fell into. Because my older aunt loves animals, but didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it. She had a stable business for a long time. But her, you know, she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had actually my cousin's father. Actually, my cousin's father went and kind of stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business. And she kind of she retired early because between that and the arthritis, she wanted retiring early. She employed my younger aunt, who is still a dog groomer, but she hates it. And it's like change your life. If you hate your life so much, change it. And I think the thing I'm most proud of is. Yeah, I'm not as financially well off as she is, but I'm doing what I want with my life. You know, I can be creative. I can have creative people around me, people who I actually like to talk to around me. People I actually like in my life and be happy with that. And I see a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say I'm not like that. That I'm actually doing what I want, even though there are sacrifices. I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you.",

         " So I'm just answering questions. Okay. She's going to chat with me for a bit, and then when she's done she'll let you know and I'll give you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're done. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Hi, I'm Ellie. I just created a topic in the morning, and it's called, I'm not a dancer, but I'm here to learn about people and I'm glad that I'm here. I like the new fashion and the new fashion. And you can still see me in the video. Can you see me? I'm really comfortable with it. Are you going to be able to see me? Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from? I'm from Los Angeles, California. Really? What do you think you really like about LA? Wow, wonderful weather, outdoor activities all the time. What are you studying over there? Too crowded pollution. The norm. Okay. What do you study at school? I study child communications. Recently I just, I would say yes. Preschool teacher. Well, I've always worked with children ever since I was 18 years old. So I figured doing something helping someone. It doesn't pay well, but you're investing in the future. Wow. Some job that I could get paid to be outside all day. Get paid well to be outside all day. Yes. I'm kind of quiet, but I also like, I probably would say borderline. I like outside activities, but I mainly kind of do activities probably by myself. So yeah, I would say I'm an introvert slightly. Wow. Just maybe a racist or disrespectful person. I kind of shut down and reevaluate how I am as a person, how I'm coming off to other people. I can't change anyone else's personality, but I can work on my own. You're pretty good. I usually argue with people I usually walk away. I mean, an argument doesn't settle anything. Wow. So a lot of things I regret, but it's not anything that I can control. Probably the biggest regret was losing my mother. Thank you. I was extremely close to my mother. That was who I am as a person who made me as a person. Wow. 2010 years ago I would tell myself not to be so angry, so upset all the time about things I can't control. I would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself. Pretty cool. I think you should have different avenues to deal with different people. No, I have not. No, I have not. Yes. I realized I have to evaluate myself as a person, so I can't really look to anyone else to help me unless I start with myself. No, I don't. I feel like as a person, as an individual, I feel like I should be able to control things myself. I feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else. It probably is very good for other people. I've worked with that population of PTSD veterans before, so I know that it helps a lot of people, but I don't feel like it's for me. It's not difficult at all. I've always been alone or someone who tries to handle my own problems and situations. I'm a little depressed, but I think everyone has a little bit of sadness in them at some point. Day by day, day by day, I just started an exercise program, so I'm trying to look at myself for the solution. I've always known, ever since I was a child, things move me differently than other kids, so I felt like I was always different. I felt like if I was going to ever understand me as a person, then I would have to work on myself. Okay. When was the longest time you felt really happy? Today. I got to see my best friend after a long time. I mean, happiness comes and goes, but I felt happy today. That's great. How are your best friends? Wow. He would say really silly, but still, when I'm around him, I try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy. No one wants to be around a depressed person. Wow. I mean, on certain days, everything could be my best quality, but I would say I'm loyal, I'm dependable. I would just say I try to be there in the moment. I'm not a person who is really flashy or into materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded. Can someone tell me about your mother? Oh, my mother. By far, my sister. Can you tell me about that? My mom was a school teacher, which made me want to become a school teacher, and that's basically what I have been doing. My sister has been at her job for 40 years, so I've always had a stable influence in my life. What is your favorite thing about your mother? Wow. I would say just sitting on a sunny, nice day talking to my mother, I would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately. How do you feel about your mother? Wonderful. Wonderful. What is your favorite thing about your mother? I like to get out and play sports. I play four or five different sports, and I like to go for a walk. I like to ride my bike. I like to get out and be active. What's good? What are you learning from your mother? Having such a wonderful mother. I mean, I have to keep going back to that subject, because we're introduced into this life, and that's our first teacher. That's our first teacher, and it's going to be our teacher for a very long time. I'm just very thankful. I'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother. How did you get so into your mother's life? Riding my bike. Simple things. Going for a walk with my sister, exercising. When was the last time you talked to her? Just last Sunday. That's good. Okay, I think I know what I'm saying. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Well, thank you. Bye. Wow. That was too scary. That was too many glasses.",

         " I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. And when she sends, she'll let you know. I'll put the doorbell over here. You can let me know when she sends. Okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in San Bernardino, California. Really? Yes. Where do you live? I'm staying with a sister in North Hollywood. What's it like for you living with them? She makes it as comfortable as possible. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. And the air is so nice. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. And the entertainment. And the public transportation. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's very difficult to find full-time employment. And some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the South. Because I lived in the South before. And those are the only two things. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. What did you study at school? I was an English major in college. Are you still working on that? I haven't finished. Yes, I am. What's your dream job? I'd like to be a recording singer. Really? Yes. When did you decide to do that? I've always loved to sing from the time that I was a child. Do you consider yourself an introvert? At times. Can you tell me about that? When I'm alone, I am extremely... I guess I would say... Inter-minded. I have a lot of thoughts and I keep them to myself. So if I'm in that mode, then I don't really interact with people. But I can also interact with people if I change modes. Okay. Okay, listen. What do you do to relax? I've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago. Cool. When was the last time that happened? Last week on Thursday. No, on Tuesday. What do you do when you're annoyed? Usually I just try to remain quiet and listen to the situation, if it's a person or if it's a situation that I'm dealing with myself that's annoying. I try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better. Come up with alternate plans so I won't be annoyed. How are you able to control your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I may have had an argument a few weeks ago just about timeliness. Meeting on time and showing up on time. It was actually last Monday. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To just be cautious of people's intentions. And to listen really well because people usually tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it. How would your best friend describe you? A good listener. Patient. Fun. Loving. Generous. Depressed sometimes. But generally a good person. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Within a year and a half ago. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? I just knew that I often thought about situations that happened in the past and kind of blamed the situation for my future. Can you verify something? Certain settings. Can you tell me about that? If I see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when I was younger when things happened and changed my future plans. So I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time. Do you still go to therapy now? I do. Is going to therapy helping you? I'd like to believe that it does. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? I don't worry as much. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues relieves me of the tension of holding them inside. So that's how it's helped me. How hard is that? At first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it actually is good because I know that when things are occurring if I'm able to communicate about them with a certain individual it relieves me of the stress of trying to figure out everything alone. And oftentimes by speaking about the issues it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because I'm hearing myself speak of the issue. Are you happy you did that? Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm planning things and if I'm planning things it affects my sleep. I might wake up in the middle of the night. So sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Irritable. Just very irritable. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? I was feeling anxious but now I'm calmer. Today I don't but I have in the past week. I was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so I was becoming anxious. Thank you. Yes. Maybe in October. When my mother first came she came to visit me in October and when she first got here we had a good time. The first couple of days. So I was happy to see her. I hadn't seen her in over a year. I'm proud that I'm able to adjust to different situations. The older I've gotten the more adaptable I am in different environments and different situations. I've learned how to be more resourceful. So I'm proud of that. I'm sorry? My dad, my sister, she's positive because she's finished her master's degree. My mom sometimes. My best friend is very positive because she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it. So that's an inspiration. When someone lies consistently. I listen very very well. Sometimes I give good advice. I'm a good friend. I normally do the things that I say I'm going to do so I'm dependable. I communicate well and I enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods. Being around positive people. Music puts me in a good mood. Comedy shows put me in a good mood. Good food puts me in a good mood. When I graduated from high school. It was a really, I will never forget it. It was a wonderful day. Very confident, accomplished and I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future. You're welcome. Bye. Thank you.",

It started out when she was little about education, the right school to go to, the right activities to do, setting a good example, being a good role model. What's the best thing about being a parent? Oh, everything. My kids are the greatest joy of my life. I love them so much. And you just get so enriched and fulfilled by them.

Tired, sad, depressed, blue. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I'm just not happy. I don't feel good and I'm not happy. How do you cope with that? I don't just stay to myself, don't go out with friends as much as I used to. That sounds really hard. It's very hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Terrible. I don't sleep. I'm sorry. Thank you. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Crazy, distracted. It's hard for me to cope with things. Easy, mundane things are just difficult. I see what you mean. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Well, being around my kids is fun. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? My son and daughter-in-law and my daughter and I went out to have Hawaiian food. We got together. It's always fun to get together. We got together at my house on Christmas. I enjoyed just getting together with them. Awesome. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'll take better care of my health, I guess. Have you done anything to avoid it? I don't know. I don't know. Okay. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my daughter's pretty positive and upbeat. My parents, they're both gone, but they were pretty positive. What's on your mind when you're most memorable experience? I suppose going on a trip to Canada with my daughter was very memorable. Can you tell me about that? We flew to Detroit, where I have my best friend lives there. We stayed with her. We drove from Detroit through Canada, Niagara Falls. We went to Buffalo, where she's from. She has three girls. My daughter was, I think, third or fourth grade, something like that. It was just fun for all of us to get together and do things. That sounds like a great situation. What would your best friend describe you? Exactly like her. We're outgoing. We're outspoken. We tell it like it is. We're high-energy people. We have a lot of anxiety. We like to do a lot of the same things. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. About three or four weeks ago. Tell me more about that. Well, I say that my feeling is attributed to weather. I don't like cold weather, and I'm not comfortable at all in it. Whenever the weather changes, I sort of get down. What would you say if somebody asked about you? Well, I'm funny. I'm hardworking. I care about everyone. I'm a very kind, compassionate person. I have sympathy for everyone. I'll reach out to someone that I see in a store or anywhere that needs my help. That's good. What are you most proud of in your life? I suppose raising my kids and the good people they've turned out to be. That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye.",

Tell me more about that. I went with my mother and some family friends. We went on an eight day cruise down the Nile. Saw all the pyramids in Giza. It was just an incredible adventure. Just to get away from everything and everybody. And close friends and just have a great time. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. How close are you to your family? Not really at all. Why? Just a history of abuse and neglect. Just not a real functional family. Dysfunctional is definitely a key word in our family. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? No, not really. I've talked about it a lot before. I'm okay with it. Okay. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. It's really hard to say. I haven't had very good, very positive role models. Ask me the question again. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. Maybe it bests my mother. She's also been a negative aspect of my life. I guess I can't really identify anybody who's been a real, real positive influence in my life. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? The trips that I've been on. What do you do to relax? I used to work out. I used to do yoga. I used to meditate. I used to exercise. I used to do a lot of things. Lately, I find it hard to relax. I don't have the same outlets that I did before. I don't pursue them as much anymore. I guess I lost my motivation or something. I'm depressed about it. I guess there it is right there. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. I'm not a temper as far as getting to the point of physicality. I don't ever that. But I stand my ground. But I can control my temper. I never lose control really. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time? Probably as recently as in the last month or so. I maybe argued with an acquaintance over... I don't know. I have to come back to that question. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Officially October of last year. I think I've been depressed longer than that. Officially October of last year. What got you to see the doctor? Actually I was being treated for other medical issues. My depression was notable to the doctors. Really? Yeah. Did you have a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? I've never been suicidal. I just often have thought that I don't have much reason to live. I used to think I had a purpose and such. I don't really have anybody in my life who I think cares enough about me. If I was even dead. I've kind of lost myself. I used to think I had enough. I used to be enough. That I was enough to have purpose in my life. I've lost quite a bit of that. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Well I'm trying to pull it together. I'm trying to get back a sense of me. I get inspired every once in a while. But overall I just don't seem to be making much progress. Do you still get up there every now and then? Yeah. Do you feel like there's a system? I wouldn't really call it therapy. I don't have a therapist per se. I have a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me. And nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues. It sucks. Uh huh. Did you say that sucks? Okay. Yeah. How have you been feeling lately? Um, overwhelmed, preoccupied. Just trying to stay alive. Stay on top of things. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or your conversation? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh, easy when I can. I don't, um, yeah, if I get a chance to fall asleep I don't have any problem with it. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm even more distracted and, um, even more lackluster I guess is the word. Sounds really hard. Whatever. How would your best friend describe you? If I had a best friend, um, I don't know. Maybe a lot of positive edges before but now just, you know, just, uh, some people say I should be proud because I'm surviving a hard time. Or some people think that I'm a loser. So, um, I don't know. Maybe a survivor. Persistent. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? Well, I used to be proud of my career and, um, kind of giving back to people. Giving back to society because I was given a lot it felt like. So I'm just proud to, uh, I don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest. I've, um, I don't know. Okay. What did you study at school? Psychology. And, um, well initially, yeah. Are you still working in that? Um, no. Not really per se although my current career involves a lot of, uh, psychology. A lot of, um, the aspects. I don't know what I'm trying to say. Um, it's a part of it but it's not the center of it. Hi, Mr. Man. What do you do now? Um, well, I guess if my career is still going I'm in nursing but, um, I've been sick lately and with depression and other health care problems I have found it necessary to apply for disability. Social Security income. And I'm starting the process of that because I'm not working. How hard is that? Mary. What's your dream job? Educating people. Um, making a difference. I mean I used to, I had my, I've had my dream jobs. I've had my dream jobs. I don't, uh, I don't know if the future will hold for, for, uh, work but, um, something I suppose working with people again. Health, uh, helping in some way. Okay. You consider yourself an introvert? Um, no but lately with depression more so at times. Uh huh. Is there anything you regret? I used to say that I never regretted anything because I would make the best decision of all things in front of me but, um, I just wish there were times then that, um, the choices that I would have were, uh, were better because some choices that I seem to have made or were made for me have, um, made my world kind of shitty. For lack of a better word, shitty. Can you give me an example of that? What? I don't understand. Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be strong. To, um, believe in myself. To remember that I've survived a lot of things and I'll survive this too. To get up off my ass and move. To, um, to have confidence. Faith. Um, I just, Murphy's Law has kicked my ass so much, you know. I just, uh, it seems like when I've tried to make my world better I just keep getting knocked down. Um, so it's almost like I'm, I don't want to give up but, um, every time I try and move forward I get knocked back. And it gets, it's exhausting. And I don't have any support system really. Nobody. Not really. What would you say of somebody who has followed you? Um, loyal. Um, hardworking. Um, dependable. Um, capable. Um, well, that seems to me. Uh, uh, intelligent. Contemplative. Um, deep. Not a superficial person. Um, yeah, I guess those are some of the... When was the last time you felt really happy? Many years ago. Can you tell me about that? Um, I used to have a lot of confidence. I used to be a pretty dynamic person. I used to be, people used to say that I was the most centered person that they knew. And I used to help people and I'm now in their shoes and I don't seem to be able to help myself. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I can't think of anything right now. I can't think of really anything right now. What are some things you like to do for fun? I don't do much anything for fun anymore. I used to, however, go to movies and entertainment venues and travel. Go to dinner with friends, do things. But lately I don't really have any pursuits. A good day, a happy day, a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong, basically. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye. Bye.",

         " Okay. Oh, God, fix my hair. Okay, thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in the same kind of caring environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to ask me questions that you find helpful. Okay, thank you. Okay, I have a question for Ellie. Who is the best girlfriend? I'm not sure how I got this question. I'm not sure how I got this question. I'm just not sure how you got this question. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in safe and secure environments. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York. Really? Why do you live in LA? To pursue a music industry, a job in the music industry. Are you still working on that? Yes. What do you do now? Self-employed. What's your dream job? To become a music producer. Awesome. How hard is that? It's pretty hard. There's a lot of competition. I see what you mean. When did you move to LA? To pursue a job. When did you move to LA? When? About a year ago, last February. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It was pretty difficult. East Coast is a lot different than the West Coast. Yeah. How often do you go back to your hometown? I think I've been there twice in the past year. That's good. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm more of a creature of habit. Okay. You consider yourself a creature of habit? Yes. Why? Sometimes I feel like I don't fit into the crowd. It's better sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of going in and actively pursue things. What do you do to relax? Probably listen to music and spend time with my dogs. What are some things that you do to relax? Probably people being not very nice to me or seeing injustices. I think that's about it. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone? Probably a couple of days ago. One of my friends was saying that they were making a comment about how I am and I got kind of upset about that. Does that happen now? Yeah, it does. How close are you to them? Pretty close. How do you know them? They're my best friend. I'm just one of my friends. What do you do when you're annoyed? I kind of am quiet about it. When a person pushes me to a certain point, that's when I overreact usually. How hard is that? It's pretty hard. I'd rather the person notice that I'm getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting to the point where it blows out of proportion. What's one thing that's memorable for you? Probably spending time with my family in New York. How close are you to your family? That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Tell me more about that. I don't know, they're just great people. I love them a lot. They're a lot like me, so I feel like I have people that understand me. That's good. Tell me your best time describing them. Probably loyal, sensitive. I don't know, it's kind of hard. It's a hard question. Have you ever sort of been military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Gosh, I think probably 1997, so a long time ago. What got you to see the health? During that time I was just going through a lot of issues and I was feeling unsafe to myself, so I ended up going to the doctor to kind of get meds and have therapy and stuff. Do you still go to therapy now? Not currently. I ended about like six months ago. Why did you stop? I just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me. I felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over, and she wasn't really challenging me. I've been in therapy for a really long time, so I just knew it was a change. Sorry to hear that. It's okay. Do you feel like there's a usefulness? Yes, I do actually. When I feel connected to a therapist, I feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what I'm going through. What sort of changes have been made since you've been in therapy? I'm better at describing my emotions and feelings. I think the biggest thing is when I'm in situations, I can see myself reacting one way, and I take a step back and see how I can react normally almost in a way. Also, I tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel really bad about myself. It's nice to talk to someone that's not judging, that doesn't really tell me it's okay basically. What were your symptoms? Feeling hopeless all the time, not having enough energy to do things I used to like, I had a little bit of concentration issues, having weird, disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind, and overall just feeling kind of crummy about life. Are they triggered by something? Sometimes they are, like random moments, if there's a problem with my interpersonal life or something like that, or if I sometimes even seeing something on television, sometimes that affects me. How do you tell people? Listening to music or trying to distract myself, trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things. How can you tell people you're related? It's been a tough transition to come here, well, being here, so kind of half and half okay and not okay. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? I feel like I've been a little bit more withdrawn lately, but that's about it. Okay, how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Some days it's great, some days it's not. More recently it's been a little bit more difficult. Why? I don't know why, I have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night, so I tend not to sleep very well, and I wake up quite frequently during the night. Why do you like to be down sleep well? I'm very groggy in the morning and that's about it. Like during the day I tend to yawn a lot, and my friends always are like, why are you yawning so much, are you just as interested in what we're doing? And I'm trying to tell them it's not that at all. Okay, when was the last time you had a good night's sleep? Probably Christmas time when I was with my family. How did you feel about your family? Just really happy and feeling like everything was alright in my life. Having a good sense of where I was at that moment, being present with myself. That's good. What would you say are some of the best qualities? Probably, you know, let's see, that's a hard question. I think probably I can tend to read people kind of well sometimes, and I like to say that I'm good at being a good friend to people, being a good family member. I'm a hard worker when I do have a job. Do you have any regrets? Sure, I mean it's life so of course there's regrets. One that comes to mind is I wish that I don't eat as much so I can be a lot more healthy. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't take things so seriously. Enjoy being youthful and I think that's it. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a good question. Probably my previous job and my employment I worked really well with kids. So I did a great job at that. I was a researcher at a hospital and I helped a lot of kids out for about six years, so seven years. Wow, that's interesting. Yeah, it was awesome. How did you decide to do that? I was really inclined to like reading people and so I decided to major in psychology. Then I went and worked in a mental health facility and did research with them with drugs and depression and things like that. It found a good niche for me. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. No problem. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hi. Take a moment to announce that I have stopped recording. Okay. Okay.",

         " Yes. I'm doing pretty good. I'm from Oklahoma. Yes. Yep. Oklahoma City. I'm from Oklahoma. Yep. Oklahoma City. Ah, the weather is great. I love being near the ocean and the palm trees and mountains. I just love it here. It's pretty easy. There's a few differences. It's a huge city compared to where I'm from, so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me. I just always wanted to live in California. I hated being landlocked in Oklahoma and just wanted to get out to the west coast, be near the ocean. I studied psychology and minored in art. No, not at the moment. Well, actually, I think I misunderstood your question. I'm not still working on my degree, but I am working in the field of psychology. I just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law. My dream job? Oh, I don't really know. I just want to help people however I can. I just like working with people in the realm of psychology, so I think I may already have my dream job. What do you do for a living? To relax. I like to read or watch movies. I like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends. What are the things that make you really mad? The things that make me really mad? Probably injustice towards other people, people being mistreated or abused, and people being lied to and deceived. Including myself, I hate being lied to. What do you do when you're mad? When I'm annoyed, it depends on the situation, but I try to just count to ten and take a deep breath and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way, so I just try and calm down before I say anything. How do you deal with anger? It depends again on the situation and who I'm angry with. Most of the time I'm pretty good at controlling it, but sometimes I think like most people I'll lash out at the people that I'm closest to at times, and those moments I'm not that good at controlling it. When was the last time you argued with someone? When was the last time I argued with someone? It was probably with my parents. I've been having some car trouble lately, and I'm also running low on money, so I don't even remember exactly, but I'm sure we probably thought about the fact that I need to be more self-sufficient and independent and take care of my own things like car issues.

         " Let me see. I think from this distance I think I better. Yes. Okay. From here from Alhambra. The weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. What are some things you don't really like about the weather? Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Is that amazing? How did you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? Yes. What are you doing now? I'm a photographer. Nice. What's your dream job? Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. Okay. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. I see. How do you like your living situation? It's fair. It's not the greatest. Because of being an apartment manager, I do have free rent, but I have to stay there a lot. That's tough. That part does. The free rent part is very good. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Oh gosh. My most memorable experience. That's hard to say. Well, I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. What else do you like? Oh, well I guess some sports success when I was in high school. There were a few things that I was happy about. And some art pieces I've made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death. Those are very memorable and not good though. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters. So my family. How close are you to your family? We're fairly close. Most of them live around in LA. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. Wow. When do you think of the music? Mostly very talented. Just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. Seems like they were all hooked into social media. What do you do to relax? I go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. And I... Well, there's some kind of injustices that happen. Not big deals, but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend. And when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it. And we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set up time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up. When they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that part is upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up at the office. They just need to please the school to maintain the account. So often when that something like that happens, it means they will not send you out to work at that school again, which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. That's how they do things. So that is upsetting. How do you cope with that? Most of the time I dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that might be better. That's good. Yeah. How are you at controlling your company? Pretty good. I usually might, in the moment I don't really lose it, but later I might vent or something like that. But on the location I wouldn't do that. When was the last time you argued with someone? Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. I have a friend that I'm sharing the car with today. We were arguing on where to go first. So we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And then after this was one of the things is over, then we're going to do some more of her things. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Is that what that is? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I'd say 1980. Yeah, I believe it was 1980. What got you to see the doctor? My father noticed some symptoms. My father passed away, but he was a psychiatrist. What were your symptoms? Well, I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon. And I didn't have a focus like for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all part of depression. Yeah. Isn't it that you had a problem before you found out? Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? Well, I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done. But I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. What sort of changes have you noticed since you came on the field? I think therapy makes you see what the... I thought of it as a filter or wearing a... As if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really... You see everything through that. So you have to... I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately? Or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. How have you been doing lately? I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I've noticed in my past. Right now we have a work slowdown. So it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule is too wide open. For me personally as a depressed person, I think that structure is really important. It gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere on time and interact with people. Those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed. I think I've noticed any changes in your behavior. Well, I don't know if it changes a little bit. I tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting let's say. But it's more negative. I have been thinking about how soldiers in the past, I don't know why, but during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been like to be in a front line battle with crude weapons and no medical help. I don't know. My mind seems to go there a lot where I'm just thinking about that. I've been looking at and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube and things like that. Or some other kind of like terrible doom type things like I was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that. Where I probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. Oh, you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not finishing college. I think I was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well. I didn't get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years. So that's a big regret that I have. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I think it would have been to, at certain points, I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals, just the logistics. I was an art major and I had no car. So a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and also to meet at away locations. I think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time. What would you say as somebody who has holidays? Well, I've been told I'm very patient and also I have some original artistic ideas. So those are good qualities. I'm very loyal and also I support my friends. I'm fairly generous with them. Tell me about something you really enjoyed. Let's see. Let's see, I really enjoyed it. I had a nice experience just photographing a soccer game recently. I really enjoyed that. I love listening to you talk. Okay, I think I've answered everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. It's my pleasure. Thank you, goodbye. Yeah, that was very interesting.

There's been 58. Oh, okay. Each study search has like a different number, like 200 and like 200. Oh, okay. All right, well there she is. And I will put the word on that for you. Okay, cool. Thanks. She'll get started? Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people and saved them to feel in my life. I'm not aware of us, but I'm here to learn about people and without knowing about you, I'll ask you a few questions about stuff. And please feel free to send me anything. Your answers are free and convenient. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? Fine. Where are you from in the city? Tampa, Florida. Why did you move to LA? That's a point I wanted to get into the entertainment industry. When did you move to LA? 1990. How easy was it for you to get used to it in the morning? It took a long time to get used to it. It wasn't easy. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather and if you have a hobby, you could always find a large group of people that are interested in the same hobbies you have. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, some of the people in the business world, it's pretty transient. They come and go and it's kind of difficult as far as if you, trusting people in the business world has been difficult. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not much at all. How does it compare to LA? It's quite different. The weather's different, the people are different. It's very different. Are you traveling a lot? No. What did you study at school? God, it was so long ago. School, just general stuff, business, acting, that kind of thing. What are you doing now? Well, I'm working on becoming a professional poker player and I left the stock brokerage industry successfully to do financial trading, stock options, futures, that kind of stuff. Do you consider yourself a member? Sometimes, yes. What are some things that you're doing? People, my family, just people making fun of me or just instigators, just being around negative, hostile people. What do you do when you're in orbit? I vent, ruminate over the same situation over and over again. How are you at confirming your own opinion? Pretty darn good. When was the last time you argued with someone and not with your own? Can't remember. Argued with someone. I can't really remember. That's a good sign. I don't argue much these days. Maybe online? Not really, I don't know. What's a good change? I don't know. What did I argue with somebody about? Maybe, it's been a long time. I can't really remember. Oh, I'd say Tony Robbins. Anthony Robbins. Listen to music, surf the internet, study poker, research on stocks. Watch YouTube clips. More towards my sisters, not my parents. I'm not close at all with my parents. Been estranged. No. Not officially, but some people, say I do have the symptoms of it when I've been talking about depression. Yes. I was diagnosed in the early 1990s with dysthymia, which is a mild form of depression, I think, or a long-term lasting mild depression. What thought you as being healthy? A friend had thought he had a learning disability called attention deficit disorder. At that time it was ADHD, so when I looked at the literature, it seemed similar to the symptoms that I had, so then I went to go through the same battery of tests that he did at UCLA. He still doesn't care for you now? No. Why did he stop? It's more of a financial thing. Do you feel like there's a difference? Yes. How do you feel about it? Irritable, moody, tired. Have you ever studied to use another way to get rid of the symptoms? Yes. How easy is it for you to get rid of them? Not easy. What are you like when you're not feeling well? Airheaded, spacey, slow. How do you cope with that? How do I do what? How do you cope with that? Cope with what? How do I? Just come back to that later. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I can't remember. Tell me about something you would never do to me that you really wouldn't do. Play poker online. When was the last time you where that for? In Teacher's Birthday. Yes. Yes? Wow, that's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago, it would have said to stay away from losers, avoid negative people. Don't try to change them, don't try to give them advice, don't try to help them out, don't try to show them the right way. It's just a waste of your energy, my energy. Don't do business with unethical people. New York City wise guys, New York City type wise guys, chronic liars, BSers, and uh... what does it say? Kept my room in better order, dated more women, dated more women, cleaned my room, do a better job of you know, enjoying my nice apartment and my single bachelorhood. Probably surviving my difficult childhood, my dysfunctional family, staying out of trouble, staying away from drugs, illegal drugs, making a name for myself as a good stock trader, good stock picker, and sort of my wisdom I've been able to pass on about eastern philosophy. Honest, trustworthy, honesty, perseverance, knowledgeable, being able to help people, give them advice about different things, pretty, I've got a good amount of wisdom without having PhDs or degrees, you know?

         " Okay, great. So everything's all set up now. Okay. So I'm going to pull her up, and then again she's going to ask you some questions, and then she'll let you know when she's finished. Okay. Sorry about that. No, it's okay. So if you just want to give me one second, I'll be right back. Okay. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Use your hair. We have this much technology going on. Yeah. Something's bound to happen, right? Of course. Let's start this again. It doesn't seem to be working. So that's all right. So we'll just keep going. So I'm going to do something for our purposes. Okay. And I'm going to put the... It's kind of spooky. All right. So whenever she's done, she'll let you know, and then you can press this button. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I am from Los Angeles. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? It's the center of everything. You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, being in LA also, you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But you know, you live with that. I see. What did you study at school? I was a business administration major, so I studied business. And after I finished college, I pursued a career in retail operations. Are you still doing that? No. As a matter of fact, I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years. So I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. What made you decide to do that? A couple of factors. After working numerous years in the retail business, I switched over and worked in a creative business, which was a graphic design firm. And I captured a lot of knowledge in the human resources side because I was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a small company. Are you happy you did that? Yes, I'm very happy I did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it's very helpful. That's great. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? Well, my dream job is I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am an independent contractor. I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs. And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle. But I also enjoy what I do. I'm not under as much stress as I used to be. That sounds like a great decision. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not totally outgoing, but I'm not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle, maybe more towards outgoing, but I'm not totally outgoing. When I'm around other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself. Can you tell me about that? Oh, sure. A couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had bypass operation. It had to do with stress and things like that. I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If I meet someone new, I don't just openly say, well, I've experienced this, this, and this. If it comes up, I won't deny it. If it comes up and I feel like it's something to talk about, I will talk about it. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom, my mother. She's a senior citizen. She's alone. What I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that. That's actually very therapeutic. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm not a short-fused kind of person. It takes a lot to get me really angry. As far as my temper is concerned, there's not much to that. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? I'm trying to think here. I can't recall when the last time it was, but it was probably last year sometime when I had a creditor that I was dealing with being very difficult to work with. I owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago. They weren't very understanding of the situation. I really got a little upset about that because I felt like I was being honest with them and I was more than willing to take care of my issues, but they were playing hardball and I didn't care for that. That sucks. It does. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Probably the hardest decision I ever had to make was it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who was battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him, there was a slight chance it was going to help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point, or it would kill him. That was really tough. It was a really tough decision to make. I felt like if I didn't try and see if we could help save his life or if we didn't take a chance and take that extra step, that I would regret it in the long run. That's really hard. It is. It was. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Right now I'm separated from my wife. She has her issues, I have my issues, but we are not divorced. We are just separated. We still have a relationship where we still speak to each other. We just don't live together. The relationship with my mother is really great. She's very understanding. I'm an only child, so she likes having me around, which is good because she's in her later stage of her life. She's 82 years old. I guess it's good that in its own way, maybe fate has taken place because someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing, but with me there, I think there's a comfort level she feels with me there, especially being her only child. What's something you feel guilty about? Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things that I did to hurt my marriage. As far as the things that I did, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had, and we were growing apart. When she was away, my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. I spent a lot of time in the casinos, and what eventually happened was I spent a lot of money. Obviously, that was a major issue regarding our relationship. It had to do with trust because it was devastating to my wife. How did you feel at that moment? When it came to light, I felt very guilty, and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. I'm sorry. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not at all. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, not really. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping, so no. That's good. Do you feel down? No, not at all. Have you ever spent a change in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. The only thing I can say is that after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. I tend to be a little bit more easygoing, and my friends and family have noticed that. That's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy? Probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. He basically said to me that after many tests and many months of rehabilitation, that he was happy to explain to me that there was no major scar tissue that had occurred because of my heart attack, and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watched my diet and took my medications. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I guess the number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight, just in general be more healthier physically. As far as mentally, just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things, and not to be so selfish. How do you cope with that? Just one day at a time. I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch TV. I do things that I know that if I can help myself, I do things to help myself. Is there anything you regret? There's a lot that I regret, obviously. My marriage, my working career as far as I had a long career with this major's food chain. Basically because of my gambling issues, I ended up ruining a very good career. At this point right now, there's not much I can do. I can't change what's been done, so I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me every day. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself and make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent, but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things, but deep down I don't think as a person I'm a bad person. I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had an illness, a compulsive, obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill. I was a sick person just trying to become healthy. Every day that's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night, one day at a time. How hard is that? It's not as hard as you think, but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you. It could be okay for other people to do certain things, but I cannot do those things anymore. How are your best friends around you? Most of my best friends describe me as probably easygoing, generous, a nice person to be around. They were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage, which it's still not over yet. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning, like around six o'clock. I go to a local park and it's about, this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning. I get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. Then after that I go home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax, and then just kick back for the rest of the day. Then the next day I do the same thing again. In the morning I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch TV, whatever, just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. Nice. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Lock yourself out. Okay. It's kind of, I actually got comfortable talking to you. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, that's pretty cool.",

         " therapy like this instead of with a live human, it'll put all the MFTs out of business. I think it's good sometimes. I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to, if it's someone that might just go by their questions, might judge you or form opinions. If it's a virtual human being, it might be a little less biased also. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly. All right, so I'm going to start up all the recording and then I'm going to actually... I'm trying to slide on some pictures. Sorry, that's in there. Now she is... So now she's going to have a conversation with you. She's going to ask you some questions. When she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to leave you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're all finished. Thank you very much. How do I know... Is she going to say end of session or... Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. Not at all. Sorry about that. I am. I feel pretty good. I'm wide awake. I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee. And I have an easy day today. So I am just going to chat with you. Then I'm going to the gym and run some errands. So I plan on having a nice day today. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here. And I went to school away. But I'm one of the few natives that are actually in Los Angeles. Yes, I am. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. Having owned a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida. I love the weather here. I like the culture. I like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away, one can go to the desert, say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours away, you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's a great place to live. Thank you. Yeah. Well, maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also the regulations, I'm a small business owner. So all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera, some of the other Western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here in California. It really does. Most people don't understand it, but it's also, besides the high taxes, there's a big immigration problem, which being born and raised here, most people don't see that, but it's the big tax on the social service system. And that's what makes our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's, but people don't seem to want to really deal with that, but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries and I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit and I've learned a couple of languages and I surf. Like what? I'm sorry? Like what? I didn't really understand your question. When you said like what, I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa, and I enjoy that and I enjoy warm climates now, especially where you can go and relax, where there's warm water to surf. It's the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. And I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Oh, sure. One of my favorite trips of all time, whereas I used to when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span, but about 10 years ago, we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city, even though I've been there about 10 times, we got to know the city really well, which was great. Really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping, but really having been there so many times, it really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about almost a month and really get to learn the city and it was fun. Even though I grew up in LA, I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I was younger, so my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable, but I took French all through elementary, junior high and high school. So it was nice to practice my French, even though I don't remember a whole lot, and even though I started speaking French with the French, my accent is some of the greatest, so after a couple of sentences, they start talking English to me. So that was a... Did you study at school? I have a few different degrees. So I was in Naval Science major as an undergraduate, and that was fun. And I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a degree in crisis management. What made you decide to do that? I found them interesting, and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college, I went to the Naval Academy, and I went there to play sports, and I found it real interesting, being from Southern California, going to school in Maryland. And I originally wanted to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. Are you still working in that? I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products, and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather, recently father, passed away, so I sort of run a 80-year-old family business, and it's pretty interesting. I like it, having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. What's your dream job? Actually, probably my dream job? I think it's fun, because I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home, and I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. Because I do have one daughter, and didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked, but I think I would be better than, say, a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids, that I like doing it always on a part-time basis, but it seems like, boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that, having pretty much worked for most of my life. An apartment never happened, but it sounds something that, to me, would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or a villain? I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert, whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted. But I think when I feel comfortable with certain people, and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be totally confident, or people I might have known for years, either from a personal or business situation. And be more introverted. I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy generally, and I like to use the term reserved. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? What do you do to relax? Oh, wow, that's a great idea. I used to have that on one of my ... I have several computers at home, and that used to be one of my screensavers as well. I usually tend, when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, maybe going surfing or the weather is warm. I don't surf in cold weather anymore. This makes ... It gives me like a brain freeze, even though I've surfed for over 30 years. I usually find exercise helps me relax the best, or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver. I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. That's great. That was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master, though, was my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years, I think I've gotten better at them. I think that's a key thing, and I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more ... I hadn't had those skills earlier. How are you at controlling your temper? I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. I am more likely to think before I speak now, whereas, say, 20 years ago, I was more likely to act before I thought. So I might have said more things that I ... In whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation, but I've never had a violent temper, but I would have a temper where I would fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. I think a lot of that comes ... I think the key word there is maturity. When was the last time you argued with someone and had to get it out? Oh, wow. You know, I was in the 20s. Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Basically, one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different, and I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just ... I don't know if I call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married, does someone have children with them? That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep. I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I'm I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",

         " Okay, sounds good. Yeah. I'm great. I'm great. Thank you. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity. I feel LA by itself is a country. There's so much to do, so much to explore. And there's nothing like it. I feel the same. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I like to travel more though. I've been to a few countries. Like what? I've been to, I won't say Europe, that's a continent. I've been to London. I was born here, but my family's from Nigeria, so I've been to Nigeria a few times. I've been to Denmark, Amsterdam. I've been to Germany. And I think that's it. Awesome. What are you enjoying about traveling? Just exploring new places, seeing new things, meeting new people, a different culture. It definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it. And also going to countries that may not be as developed as the US, it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of this country. I'd love to hear about London because... I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm in LA. But at the same time, you can go at a very, very slow pace. We didn't do any driving. We just went on the Tube, which is there, like the underground subway station, which I absolutely fell in love with. Just exploring different parts of the city. We went to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey. When I went there, they had the premiere of, what movie was this, Slumdog Millionaire. And also they had the premiere for Seven Pounds, it was a movie with Will Smith. They did, so Will Smith was over there. Me and my friends were kind of screaming like we were groupies. Just for antics. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. That sounds like a great situation. What did you study at school? Business management and option and human resources management. What that means, I have no idea. How did you decide to do that? Good question. I've always wanted to go into business. And I've always wanted to study finance, but I didn't think I would learn too much about finance from college per se. I think I learned more in the real world, whatnot. So the other option was human resource. And I'm always fascinated about relationships and people, always reading articles about that stuff. So I went for that. Are you still doing that? No. Well, I still kind of use what I've learned, but I work in property management. So it still has to do with people. Anything to do with people, I'm fascinated about. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for you. What's your dream job? That's a good one. My dream job. Wow. I would say being a life coach. Really? Yeah, I would say that was my dream job because I love helping people become successes. And I love being a part of someone else's success, regardless of how small it is. Whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation. You consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm quiet into myself. So, yeah. Right. To relax. I usually listen to music. I usually listen to music to relax me or I pray to relax myself or listen to some really calm music. So, yeah. Very good. Very, very good. I used to, I wouldn't say it was a bad temper, but I was known to go off, quote unquote. Not throwing chairs or anything like that. I'm a very, very patient person. Once that patient is gone and for you to do that, you have to really, really, really, really push my buttons for a long time. And once it's done, I just go off. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. No. What was the last time you argued with somebody? The last time I argued with somebody. Wow. I haven't argued with somebody in a long time. Boy. I argued with my, no. I would say my, I think my dad, I argued with him. About We were disagreeing on some things about when we were going to supposed to go back to Nigeria. And he wasn't listening to, it was kind of like a group discussion, myself and my, my siblings, and he was being very subjective. He wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns. So it started an argument. How did you feel about having to? Very I wouldn't say angry per se, but I felt very kind of like I was losing control. Like I'm the type where I like to be in control of my emotions and my thoughts and I feel once that patience is gone and I start going off, it's kind of like this. This, you know, I would call it a blur, but I'm very witty and quick with what I say. So I'll instantly say something that, you know, Not to say hurtful, but very direct and to the point. I make sure I get my point across. Yeah. I have three brothers, one, one younger, two older, and very close to my family and my mom was one of my best friends. My brothers are great. Love them to death. My father. He's more so out of the picture. Yeah. I don't I don't really I'm not the guilty type. I don't feel guilty. I'm not one to shy away from what I've done and I definitely own up to what I do. I'm not one to shy away from responsibility, but I don't think I ever feel guilty for anything I do. Yeah, I don't think I feel I usually don't feel guilty. Yeah. Pretty, pretty easy. Pretty easy at, you know, pretty good at falling asleep, except when I'm excited or I'm reading. I'm trying to when I'm when I'm focused on learning something like I'll read and read and read, even when it's past my bedtime. But now I'm trying to work on waking up much earlier than when I am now. And that's kind of a little bit of a struggle, but I'm getting to it. So. Good. I've been feeling I've been feeling fine. You know, I'm generally I have a very, very happy disposition. And so no, you know, deep, depressing moods, nothing like that. I will never if I feel do feel like I'm going I don't allow myself to go to that place. No. No. I would say it's I wouldn't say necessary changes, but I'd say more so behaviors, learning how to let go of past decisions, maybe. And kind of how they they played their course in my life. I just sometimes I kind of look back and say, what if I did this? What would have how would life be now? Yeah. So those are some games I play. But other than that, that's it. Is there anything regret? Hmm. Regrets. Uh, no, no, there's anything I regret. What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago, I would say, don't be afraid of who you are. Be authentic. More importantly, with yourself. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Hmm. Erase from my memory. Uh, that's a good one. Erase from my memory. Uh, I would say when I told my dad that he should act like a father. Maybe I should. Yeah, there was. That was actually one of the times I another time I went off, usually with him. Basically, I had decided not to go to a private, not to go away for college. I decided to stay local so I can look after my little brother. And my senior year, I was overloading with everything I had maybe like four AP classes. I was working. I was working three jobs at the time, and I was also on track and field. So, needless to say, I was kind of like burning myself out. And I wasn't doing one AP calculus because I decided to go to a JC first and transfer. Also to save money for college too. And when I told them, you know, the teacher called saying I was falling asleep in class. Just because, mind you, after school I'd work an eight hour shift because I was a retail manager at the time. So, and I'd come home after that shift to do homework, calculus let alone. So, he would get upset and I told him, I spoke to my counselor. I already told him that I don't need that class to go to the JC. Because that's something I'm going to continue with. So I'm just going to, I can't drop out at that point in time. So I'm just going to, you know, just take the D or fail or whatever. And he didn't like that because he is a teacher. I think maybe that's maybe where it came from. He's a teacher as well. And so he started blaming like my job, wanting to call my boss. And it was just too much. And I told him, you know, since you're my father you should act like it. But it was a more aggressive way I said it. So that was one thing. Well, I actually, I do remember, I do regret one thing. And that is I wish I continued with college throughout. Like I burnt myself out. I was spreading myself too thin. I was actually on track to graduate from college at, I want to say 19. Because I started taking college classes in high school, starting sophomore year in high school. But with that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working, I just kind of like stopped going to school for a while and just worked. But I went back to finish. So, but I wish I just would have continued. Maybe that's one small thing, but that's something small though. Yeah. What would you say as somebody who has qualities? I'm very, I'm a very compassionate and understanding person. I like learning new things. I'm a very, very happy person. People come to me for advice. I'm very objective. I'll tell you the good, the bad, the ugly. And yeah, those are some of my best qualities. I'm fun. I like to have fun. I have fun in any situation. I can make light of any situation. Like I'm the kind of type person I can break the tension in the room. That sort of, that sort of personality trait. Cool. Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Michelle's taller. Besides my height. Hmm. I wish maybe. I don't know if it's a be more. I want to say be more in touch with my emotions, but I think I would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes. I think that would be one thing because I'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me. And I'm like, okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate that. But I don't realize how much they do. I think that's realizing how much they care and love me. That's one thing I would like to get more of a grasp on. Yeah. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend. She describes me as someone who's funny, crazy, objective, loyal, ambitious, hardworking, mean. I always make jokes. She says, you're so mean. But. Why? I just like to joke around all the time. And so we were right now actually planning a friend of mine or friend of ours, a baby shower. I'm giving her some ideas. And there's another friend who was invited who we had some issues in the past and someone I don't talk to or hang out with. We used to be really close, but I don't really talk to a person, but I don't mind them being there. So she also talked about celebrating her birthday. Also, kind of like after the baby shower. And there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we didn't do anything for. And I'm like, well, we're celebrating this person's birthday. Might as well. We should definitely honor this person's birthday as well, since we're closer to the person whose birthday is past. And I said, you know what? Just when we celebrate everybody's birthday, forget the baby shower, just do the birthdays. And then she said, you're so mean. But she was laughing about it. So, yeah. Yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of in my life? I would say being there for my family. Being a mentally and emotionally strong person. Family has gone through a lot of challenges, and a lot of times I've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and make sure everything goes accordingly. So I'd say more than anything, making sure I'm there for my family. Okay. I think that's everything I need to say. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Have a good one. Okay. I can take this off? Okay. You wouldn't be the first one to tell her that. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay.

         " Are there any parameters? I mean, should I just talk naturally or just however I'm comfortable? Whatever you're comfortable, just talk naturally. I'm going to go ahead and just fix this. Just one spot, sorry. Okay, great. One last thing. Perfect. So again, she'll let you know when she's done. I'm going to hand you the doorbell, but I'll try to keep an eye on the time as well. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay. Where are you from originally? I was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA? Originally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA is very has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just sort of I don't know if estranged is the right word but I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. How hard is that? It's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy. So it doesn't really answer your question but Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tape and I'm not sure what I'm doing. I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? I have certain I do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really it soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed. When was the last time that happened? A few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing. How did you decide to do that? I've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me. How hard is that? It's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good. I see what you mean. How are you at controlling your temper? Good. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. What's something you feel guilty about? A lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really really that I really wanted to work and I I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and not and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty that was pretty tough. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Well some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were. I think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself. I mean it's it's possible I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Well it's it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. That's good. How do you cope with them? Um well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using I'm the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet. Are they triggered by something? They're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to to this. It's really it's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't I don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like I would I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep. I don't know. I get up, I toss and turn all night. You know and now it's just it's yeah I don't sleep too great right now. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad. Okay. How long ago were you diagnosed? I think three, three, four years ago. It was when I I had been given taken stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So yeah that was kind of a turning point. But unfortunately it happened after everything went bad. So How did you feel in that moment? In the moment I don't know. I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm that I had that I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain and I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now What got you to say help? What got you to say help? What got you to say help? Um Um There really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either I was I was self-medicating I was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but It was at least that and not firing me. But but but yeah but so I got help but it was. But it wasn't soon enough. Not not as much as I should. I go to a couple of meetings. I go to I go to a so that I can. You know keep control of that aspect to to and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately you know being unemployed my employment ran out you know I'm I'm you know I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. Somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. And then there's you. Right. Well like I said I mean. Just the talk I mean that let's just take the A.A. for example because that's probably the closest closest for them seeing with therapy right now. Just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can do. Something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. You know better than I that I have been. I mean. It's sort of it has its ups and downs. You know I'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just I have to deal with real life which is. It has its own challenge. Yeah. Yeah. It can be tough to find a good job. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um. It was probably you know a couple of years ago. Um. I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. Is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree. And we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and. I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and. Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So. What are you most proud of? Probably the. Probably this. Educate educational series I did. Educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about. And about the world around them so that I feel like that was a really good thing to do. The world. my job. It was a, we were trying to come up with new ideas for, because we would put together videos and stuff to give to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot to it so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend? I don't know. I don't know, it's been a while since I've really thought about that. I don't know, would I go somewhere? Would I? I don't know. Thank you. Howdy. Thank you.",

         " Okay, awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. You know, how about yourself? I'm great. Awesome. Where are you from? I'm from Guatemala. My parents migrated here to the United States when I was like three years old. So, yeah. Really? Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been there, actually. I haven't been back to my hometown since forever. Why? Just, you know, I have all my family here, my mom, my dad, my cousins, aunts, uncles. So, practically, I have my life here. So, I probably, I mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know, just my curiosity hasn't, you know, gone there, I guess. Okay. What's your favorite part about Guatemala? I love the people. Everyone's nice. I love the diversity, you know. There's different types of people and imaginations out there. You know, everything's just great. You know, everyone's different, you know. No one's like the same, at least to some aspects. And I love the scenery. I love, you know, the mountains. They're beautiful, you know, great for hikes, you know, taking out, you know, the dog, the family, you know. It's nice. It's pretty active. Yeah. What is your favorite smog? The smog. I don't like the smog. It's just, you know, if you go out further out, you know, you could tell by the air, you know, or, you know, everything's clear. The sky's bluer. But other than that, like, you know, in traffic, nobody likes traffic, I think. Yeah. But yeah, that's, you know, pretty much LA is pretty nice, you know. I like it. That's good. What did you study at school? Well, I was studying just basic, you know. I'm not sure exactly what I want to be. So it's just kind of, you know, here and there, just jumping through hoops and stuff. So not really set yet. It's still trying to find my interest, I suppose. What's your dream job? My dream job. That's a good one. I love working with children. So I would say probably a child psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what's going on in the young minds and, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, make children, you know, or help, you know, help them, you know, grow up in a positive way, I suppose, instead of, like, going the wrong track. Yeah. I just, you know, help children. Is it just so high-five or up-going? It depends. It depends on the situation I'm in. Sometimes, you know, I could be, like, super outgoing and just, like, you know, and sometimes I could just, I could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention, you know, if I'm, like, in class or whatever. I don't really, like, and there's everyone talking. I just, I prefer just to stay away from that, you know, because I need something else to concentrate on something else. You know, there's, like, a moment in time for everything, I suppose. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm being there, I turn on the first page of the screen favorite. Hey, I know it's not blind, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to kick my feet up on the couch and, like, read a good book, you know, just get my mind going to another, you know, galaxy or universe or situation, you know. It's pretty fun, you know, just, you know, reading and then just having yourself relaxed and, you know, feeling good. That's great. Yeah, it is. It's just fun. I love reading. How are you at controlling your own mood? I'm okay with it. I'm not, like, the best, you know, temper-controlling person there is out there. You know, I try my best and I guess that's all I could do until I keep doing better eventually. But I'm not, like, the best. I mean, I sometimes I do have my outbursts, you know. But, you know, I guess that's everyone. I'm not sure. When was the last time you argued with him? Ah, huh. That's a good question. That's a good question. I don't remember. Let's see. Honestly, I can't recall. Maybe. My goodness. I don't know. Sometimes I'm very passive. That's just like let things go because, I mean, what's the point of making a big deal out of things? You know, so, huh, I don't know. I honestly I can't tell you that at this moment. Why don't we talk about that later? Sure. Yeah, probably come back to it. What's something with your relationship? Um, huh. Well, I guess when I was younger, I, you know, could have been better older sister and I wasn't. And that makes me feel guilty for sure. You know, I could have been a better sister. Better role model. But I'm trying my best now, so I'm trying to make things better. And it's working. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your ex-wife. Oh, I guess, huh. Hmm. I don't know. I mean, I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life. So if I erase something, then it's just there's something of me in my present self or, you know, that would change. And I don't know. I'm pretty OK with the person that I am now. I mean, you know, I don't think I would change an event. You know, I'm OK with what, you know, ups and downs and good and bad that has happened. OK. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. But I am kind of like an explorer, I guess. I love to explore, like, even the smallest things. Like if I go hiking, I go off trail and, you know, just find my way up to the top, you know, somehow some way and just make it, you know, traveling. I would love to do that. But I don't know, just, you know, always circumstances in my life that doesn't, you know, always something, you know, I get married, children, you know, and all this. So it's kind of like, you know, it would be nice, I guess, you know, it would be nice. You know, I love camping. That's kind of like, you know, taking a few days trips out there, camping and fishing. Yeah. It was this summer, you know, me and my husband went camping and it was really nice. It was just me and him, you know, and it was like no one. And it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake. And, you know, it was it was really nice. It was just, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was. It was. It was really fun. It was like I would love to do it again, you know, right now. It would be great, you know, just going out there. It's just I love that venture of things and the nature and just life and, you know, overall. Yeah. It's easy, but lately I haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because I don't know, just, you know, just I'm laying there and I'm just like trying to go to sleep and I'm just like, oh, but eventually I do. You know, I just I probably like need to position myself in a different side of the bed. Like sometimes I'm in the headboard and I'm like, oh, I got to go to the other side. And once I position myself, then I just like go to sleep, you know, but it just I got to find the right position for me. Yeah. Um, I'm tired. I get tired throughout the day, you know, but I kind of try to shake it off, you know, and just kind of like feel like it's a new day, you know, and just try to make the day that I have as great as possible, you know, and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of, you know. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, it's OK. I try to make it the best, I guess. If not, then I just go to sleep throughout the day, which sucks. But yeah. No. No. I've been feeling good. Yeah, I've been feeling really good. You know, a lot of things in my life have, you know, I'm having a really good year so far. So I'm very happy with that. You know, everything's, you know, going good, you know. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. It is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible. But that's just nature. My immune system has to work harder. Super happy was when the doctor told me I was pregnant. You know, I was really, really happy about that. And I was just like, oh, you know, that was really, really good. You know, very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby. And, oh, that's very overwhelming. And it's scary at the same time. I've never really like, you know, but yeah, I'm very happy. Yeah. I don't know. I guess just me myself, you know, like, you know, I could, you know, just be myself and that's it. You know, just I can't really, you know, say I have a specific thing, I guess. I mean, it depends on the person that meets me to tell me. I can't really tell myself like, oh, I'm this, I'm that, you know, just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to, you know, tell me or, you know, compliment me or whatnot. Yeah. Oh, nothing, I think. Um, like I said, I'm happy with the person I am right now. And, you know, my flaws or whatever, you know, I might have, I don't know, whatever flaw people see in me and it's OK. You know, I'm OK with it. Whatever it just I'm not going to I can't change myself for the likings of other people. I have only one body and one life. So, yeah, yeah, that's it. Ah, just my childhood with my sisters and my family. But, you know, it's, you know, you learn from that, you learn from the past and you kind of feel like, hey, you know, maybe I should be a better role model, you know, for my children. And so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve. Um, just smile and be happy, you know, and whatever hard things happen, you know, you're going to get through them eventually, you know, the only thing you can't do is to be happy. You can't, I don't know, you can't, you know, go back on his death. You know, you could, you know, a heartbreak or whatever. But, you know, as long as I'm alive, I still got to keep going. Yeah. I don't know. That's pretty, huh, most proud of. I guess that I'm trying my best to be the best I could be. And that's pretty powerful. You know, I'm, you know, I try to be, you know, a better person each day and try to like, you know, improve myself every day as much as I can. You know, that would probably be something I could be super proud of, you know, as much as I can. Very hard. I'm not going to lie. It is really hard, you know, because I can't say, you know, it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good. You know, and, you know, it's always challenges and everything that goes, you know, in your life. But, you know, it's just it's sometimes, you know, hard, you know, and sometimes it comes easy, you know, after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try, you know. So, yeah. You know, loving, friendly, outgoing, you know, adventures, I guess. I don't know. That's what they say. Just, you know, that's them. Like, you know, but that's what at least what I try to be. You know, at least I try to give the best foot forward always as much as possible. You know, even sometimes even if I'm having a rough day, I'm just like, oh, you know, you know, I just I don't want to be bad. You know, I just I don't want to take it out on anyone or anything, you know. Yeah. Yeah. How do you spend your ideal weekend? My ideal weekend. Usually I like going to the park. I like sitting down in like a tree under a tree, actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there, have my dog and like read a book. And, you know, sometimes if I don't have my dog, like there's little scrolls running around and they like me to feed them. So that's pretty neat, you know, just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise, I guess, because there's not silence. You know, the wind and the cars and, you know, it's just it's really neat. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.",

         " Since there's nothing else Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty okay. Thanks for asking. How are you? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm from here in LA. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Cool. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? What do you enjoy about traveling? I love traveling. I like experiencing new things. I think that would be nice. Despite the fact that I said I like the familiarity of LA, there's also fun in discovering new things. So I think when I travel, that's what I like to do, just check new things out. If I could make a living doing that, that would be great. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips? Okay, well, let's see. The last trip I took... Let me think of one more exciting trip. Well, my family is from Eastern Europe, so one of the trips I took with my parents when I was 14 was I went to Austria, Hungary, and Romania, and getting to see some of those old... I'd been a few times before, but it was when I was little, so I don't really have too much memory. Plus, I didn't really process things quite the same as when I was kind of more of age. So I got to see my family's old hometown. We have a family tomb, so I got to see that. Then just these old buildings and just a different way of life. I really like that, seeing my parents' old friends. So that was pretty fun. It was very different. It was really my first time being taken away from my home environment. I left them all the school year, so it was just like going from suburban America to traveling around, taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old hundreds of year old towns. I don't know if it was for everyone. I don't know. It would be great for everybody, but I really enjoyed it. Awesome. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? That's a good question. I probably one of the things I do is either turn on a rerun of a sitcom. I watch The Office a lot, so I kind of know when that's on. So I'll turn that on, just kind of zone out a little bit to familiar characters and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason. Or maybe eating some kind of comfort food. I try not to eat too much fast food at all, but in and out, I really like going there. So if I have to unwind once every few months, maybe I'll do that. Or I really like to read, especially like I'll read the day's events. That really relaxes me for some reason. Even if it's reading about some conflict going on somewhere in the world, I still read the headlines. I really like to know what's going on. That kind of centers me. So I really enjoy that. That's something I do to relax. How are you at controlling your temper? I would say I'm pretty great at it, although I think my nature makes it pretty easy. I don't get very upset easily at all. So it's not much of a challenge to control my temper. Yeah, I don't really have anger issues. It's difficult for me to get angry. So I don't really have much trouble with that at all. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody was probably...I don't even know. Small disagreements I might have had with family or friends about things. But just a full-on argument, I can't even remember. It's been years. I don't really argue too much. I try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my personal life. I don't really see anything to be gained by it. I naturally repel away from it. So I don't have much to say about arguing. What's something you feel guilty about? I say what you mean. Tell me about me then. I say what you mean. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I say what you mean. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. What's something you feel guilty about? I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I rammed into her old one and I was back to her old one and I was back to her old one and the確erboiaje월 later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job uh... allows me for to be pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh... i wish i could were like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up so one or two every night uh... and is just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or what not asleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i wish i were more uh... able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven and then sleep and wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later waking up later i'm pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health wise i feel good uh... you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh... uh... everything is great so far i i've absolutely no no real complaints uh... as far as i'm feeling on myself for anything like that no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that uh... everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing uh... kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort is this happened there is happening no no well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh... yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things uh... in my life uh... yeah like i said i i do regret uh... you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh... i hung out with a lot of friends yeah i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us work we just uh... you know we we got high every day uh... or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh... it was a kind of like a throwaway period of my life i would say that uh... it's important to to to engage with the world i think i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to uh... recognize the people around you for what they are you know what what kind of potential you know future activities that you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh... i would say also that uh... can try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that uh... that approach is kind of fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know uh... just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule life is in a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and uh... thinking that things will fall into place well i i guess when people i i don't especially uh... take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that at least for myself i sort of five things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh... group work that done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is kinda picked apart or scrutinized i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should uh... was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh... somebody with much less it was three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it and there was somebody just out of college you know uh... went over what we had done and you know just kinda rewording things and it seems just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of changing things and i can't take personal fence to that just uh... because i thought i had a lot more experience more education and uh... it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just uh... i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to necessarily redo all our work uh... or or even to uh... now not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh... uh... proofread i guess that to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know it was kind of like uh... an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but it wasn't our call most memorable experiences uh... well i guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my uh... the first real trip i took by myself uh... i i took the uh... the amtrak to new mexico and i was out there exploring things uh... for about ten days on my own uh... so that was kind of the longest period of time up till that point and i was in my i was twenty three maybe at the time that i had had really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time uh... it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh... you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions uh... and it was a lot of fun uh... uh... why been very happy recently i mean for that i'm getting married in a few months i got engaged on labor day uh... in two thousand twelve thanks so i was uh... that was a very happy day this this whole process you know uh... meeting someone and we we kind of progressed very quickly realize where we recognize where we were so i've been a pretty happy state the past uh... well it's been eleven months now but uh... yes so i think that the day we got engaged and we we shared with our family i think those have been very happy times uh... new years was happy you know i've been a happy period of my life right now so yeah thank you uh... with the sort of uh... sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh... also uh... you know uh... helpful calm relaxed maybe uh... intelligent uh... you know likes to recycle i know that's a subject that they would say uh... and what else i think that uh... best friend might say that uh... i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats they might describe as a people person i mean an animal person excuse me i also you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans uh... i'd say one of the most part of my life i i i'm pretty happy with the level education i've gotten i'm also going back and starting the fall and starting a phd programs i'm happy about that happy about you know breaking some of that habits from the past i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that uh... you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't pride is the right word but uh... my relationships with family and friends are all very good uh... i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change and i'm happy and proud of that no problem have a good day thank you goodbye okay All right.",

         " I'm in the right spot. It's pretty good animation though. Yes. Good. It's been a nice day. The South Bay. Really? I'm from LA. Cool. What are some things you really like about LA? Why? Too many people and too much traffic. I can't see your shoes. Driving and seeing new stuff. Last year I went to Sacramento from here and stayed out for like a month living in my VW bus with my wife. It was kind of cool. Camping. Just wanting to have fun. Something different. Art. No. A little bit. Probably doing what you're doing. I'm really interested in coming up with new ideas and stuff too. Awesome. Outgoing. I haven't been doing much to do relaxing lately but I like the beach. Good. I argued with my brother last night actually about him. Talking to me with more respect. As a person. I was mad and I wanted to fight. It's good but sometimes they're just too caught up in what they're doing to pay attention to other people's feelings. Like with my brother. He's just tense because of his situation and he tried to brush it off on me. Wasting money because I'm married now. Yeah, not doing it. Something like probably taking some candy from the store. No, no. Taking money from my mom when I was really young. I was in junior high school and I think I took like 20 from her purse and bought candy for my friends. I felt guilty though like the same day. Probably the beginning of my stupid activities. All my life or in the past couple years. My wife. I'm married to her. We've known each other for about two years. I met her at an art walk. She actually went to USC too. The past couple days has been kind of hard but I usually go to sleep good. I think I'm kind of snappy. Positive, optimistic. Yeah. I've been thinking more positive positively lately and I want to put a lot of stuff in action. So I've been trying to train my mind into knowing that stuff is going to come to me. Speaking to the universe. Easy if you just try it and do it. Everybody's got a spirit. No. No, I just told you I feel positive. I was happy yesterday. I'm happy yesterday because I you know I made a couple good decisions. Wanting to be positive and stay away from negative people. Being alive knowing God. I don't know. I don't know. Sex, exercising, waking up positive and having a good meal in the morning. I was driving to Sacramento that time. No. Don't smoke cigarettes and watch how you spend your money. I'm going to sell my ideas and my thoughts. I can't think of anything. I can't see.",

         " Nice, I have my hair. You see what you look like, you're like, oh my god, I look dumb. So this picture is not based on a real woman at all. No, they used, it's not based on an actual person. Okay, so when she's done, I'll just wait for a flash in our system. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people and based them on my experience. I'm not a bear but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'd love to give you questions and insights. And since you're a baby, your interests are fully confirmed. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. It's still morning, so. Where are you from originally? I'm from the East Coast, Massachusetts. Really? Yes. When did you move to LA? I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents. Pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been back there. The last time I was back there was three years ago for Christmas. How does it compare to LA? LA is very hustle and bustle. There's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA. In which back east, the East Coast, the thought pattern is a lot different. You know your neighbors, you're friendly to your neighbors and you're kind to anybody that you see in the street. So, yeah. How would you say it was a period that you feel alone? Well, since I was a kid, I was fairly young. At first it was rough. I was getting in trouble a little bit in school. But after all that surpassed, I did fine in high school and stuff and even took some college courses. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, I love the beach and I love the mountains. I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach. I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy. Nice. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not at all. Why? Just not interested. I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger. Went to Ensenada. But other than that, I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what's been going on lately overseas. Okay. What did you study in school? Actually, child psychology. And I was in the nursing program for a little bit. But I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. What are you doing? That's right. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? I don't have one. To be honest, I admire people that are doing the job that they love. I mean, like football players. They love playing football and they get paid all that money. How great is that? Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I'm pretty outgoing. When I meet somebody at first, I might be a little bit reserved because we all, when we meet somebody, pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not. But once I've decided that I like that person or whatever, I talk a lot. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? I like watching movies. I used to like reading, but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great, so it's hard to get into a good book. How are you at control of your temper? Not good at times. I have some outbursts every once in a while. It depends on how angry I get. When was the last time you argued with someone? Yesterday. It was with my partner. Actually, to be honest, I don't remember what it was about. Sometimes people can have an ugly attitude, and I don't appreciate that. If I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever, I'm going to stand up for myself. Do you have problems with your partner? At times, some people may be turned off of my personality because I'm very opinionated. I say what's on my mind. I do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature. But I won't be bullied, and I won't back down if I feel like I'm being challenged. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in with your partner. Last year, my mother died. I wish I handled that differently. Is it uncomfortable when you talk about it? It upsets me. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see. I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that will upset me more. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That is terrible. Sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem, especially when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day, you're tired. But staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I get up and then I'm wide awake. I'll go out in the living room, turn on the TV, and watch TV. I think I'll get three to four hours sleep. Maybe because I do have a lot on my mind, thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and all this other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it. It's not difficult, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes on overtime mode, it just affects everything, your concentration, your sleep, your eating, everything. What are you like when you're grouchy? I'm a little grouchy, especially in the morning. I'm not a morning person. I like the nights, but I don't like the mornings. It's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee. Other than that, I'm okay. How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been depressed for quite some time, and I'm still having difficulty. After my mother died four months later, my uncle died. I had two deaths last year, so I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. Just recently, I've started pursuing interests that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened. Have you ever spent a day in the living room or the bathroom? I might get angry a little easier. I sleep a lot. I eat. I overeat. I get tired very easily because I don't get much sleep. Sometimes it's hard. It seems like I'm struggling to get through the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I was diagnosed quite some time ago. Probably 10 to 15 years ago. It's just something I've never gotten over. I don't know whether or not you can, so I've always taken the medicine. What kind of medicine did you take? I was arguing with everybody, my family, my friends, and stuff like that. I was feeling desperate and hopeless. I had attempted to take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized. Then they started treating me. I started seeing a therapist. Are you going to a therapist? Well, right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance, they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. But I am working with a friend of mine who knows some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist. I don't know if that's really going to help me. It depends on what kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on, and you're thinking, my God, what good is this? The other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions. What sort of changes have you noticed in your therapy? Like I said, I haven't been going to therapy recently, just psychiatry, just medication. There's been no changes, really. I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away. I was her caregiver. Even though a lot of times I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I still was a heck of a lot happier than I am now. How many of us in the last few years felt really happy? I would say when my son was born, years ago. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I'm not a parent anymore. He passed away. That was difficult as well. I'm sorry you're late. What would you say as a mother about telling you? I'm extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done, but sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained. Those qualities are admirable in people that can keep their word and be responsible. Excuse me? Oh, I have lots of regrets. Things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about. I met somebody once in my life that had that saying, and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. You can't go back and make changes. It's too late, so why dwell on the situation? Sometimes it's a lot easier said than done. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'm not the advice kind of get person. I don't really give my friends any kind of advice. I find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway, so why bother? I just state my opinion. That's all. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating. After my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive. I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot. Sleep, eat, sleep, eat. Now I'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight because it's very unhealthy for me. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I'm trying to think it's been a long time. Actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy. I haven't been to a movie in ages. I used to go out shopping all the time. I don't now. So it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now. Tell me how you spend your weekend. My weekends, like on Saturday I'm usually working. On Sunday is usually clean up day. Do your laundry, clean up the house, run some errands, go shopping for food. That kind of thing. If I was younger it would be fun to go out clubbing or whatever, but I'm too old for that now. What are you most proud of in your life? Really there's nothing that I can think of. There's nothing that I can be proud of. What are some things that you do that you can give me? A good comedy or whatever. I like to watch that. Sometimes my partner might do something stupid, which I like because I make fun of them. But that's it. Maybe go out for a walk on the beach. That's it. Okay. No problem. Thank you. Bye. Does somebody talk for her or is she just talking to me really? I'll actually explain to you how she works once we're finished up with the study. Okay. Can you actually take that headset off? Thank you.",

         " Okay. All right. Thanks. Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks. Hi. Yeah. Go ahead. Okay. I grew up in Wisconsin and I grew up in the Colorado for a bit and then I lived overseas for a little while and then I moved to California. I moved here at the end of June of last year, so I guess it's been eight months, something like that. Yeah. At the most, probably twice a year. Well, my hometown is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms. So the opposite of LA. Okay. It's a good question. I always wanted to live in California, but I had been living in the Central Coast and I just had been coming down to LA once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff. So yeah, things were changing. In Santa Cruz for me, the client I had who was really the main financial source I had, that relationship ended, so I was totally free to move and I thought, well, I guess I'll give LA a try and see what happens. So I gave it a shot and here I am. No, not at all. It's a very, very big city. I lived in Dublin in Ireland, which is also a big city, but European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy. Yeah, so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city and the people that are traveling and, well. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I love to travel. I love it. I lived in Ireland and I traveled. I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica. I love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures, and also not just seeing what's different, but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go. Sure. Well, I guess I'm trying to think which was my favorite. I mean, there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both, but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days and we went to three different locations. We went up in the Atlas Mountains, which are beautiful. Yeah, it's a really, really cool culture. It was fun. What was the most memorable experience? My trip to Ireland, I actually visited there, which is why I decided to move there. So my most memorable moment of that trip, I mean, there's probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being on a bus and leaving Dublin and going just down to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is. Everyone sees pictures of Ireland or you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous, but you actually get there and experience it. The pictures don't do it justice. It was incredible. Awesome. What did you study at school? I have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies. Are you still working on that? No, I use my English and psychology. I work in marketing communications. I actually do sales. So yeah, the psychology definitely comes into play and so does my, I guess my undergrad degree in English, but really I took that on and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I wasn't wanting to teach. What made you decide to do that? I guess I'm not clear on the question. Let's come back to that later. Okay. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? Wow. My dream job is being a motivational speaker and trainer and coach and traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship is pretty good actually. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who was sporadic. I saw her sporadically growing up. I lived, my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together. So I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with. But I got in communication with my biological mother last May and we've been cleared things up and have been in communication since then. How did you feel in that moment? Well, I'm not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and not just the future but in the present moment with her. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? To relax I do a number of things. I like to do yoga although I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance. I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharges my battery actually. Probably more than anything else. I like to be with friends. I love art and trying new restaurants. Yeah, all those things are both relaxing. I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life. How are you at controlling your hunger? Depends. If I'm driving, not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it. When was the last time you argued with someone? Last time I argued with somebody. Probably would have to be... Oh no, it was with the LA Times about the newspaper delivery. Yeah, that was the last time. Yeah, the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of. It didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until I don't know, afternoon, I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10.30 in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. For a service that would pay for it for every day. Yeah, I was really irritated. Then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me. I was angry with the LA Times, I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. Yeah, I was pretty frustrated. Oh wow, there are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program and it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be, we have meetings every week, classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach and that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so in that moment it just seemed to me like, oh my god I have all these people I have to be accountable to and I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was I don't know. I wasn't angry I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and you know and I talked it out with her and we got through it but yeah I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother. The hardest decision wow there's been a few. I guess moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision. No it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging but the hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family. I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that was a pretty tough decision because at that point my family had been within an hour's drive of wherever I lived an hour, hour and a half and now they were going to be a 12 hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was challenging. Oh lots of things I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado so there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single that was another factor and were interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit and then I found a job that I liked, the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and I chose to move. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That was a totally unrelated question. Relatively easily it just depends on what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11.30 then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired and I don't know how much better I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those or if I stir from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. Are they triggered by something? I'm moving out of the house that I live in right now where I take care of an elderly woman and I have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being, she's exhausting and utterly depressing. How hard is that? Living with her is pretty hard, it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again. Honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation. How have you been feeling lately? I'm like this, there's nothing I can there's no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy. Have you been diagnosed with depression? How long ago were you diagnosed? What got you to see me out? Did you feel down? Do you still get a therapy now? I don't actually, no. Why did you stop? Well I originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed, we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and then I began therapy again later on it was in my early 30's and then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland. Yeah I mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention I don't go into therapy thinking oh I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy. Huh. Wow that's pretty sad. It was at least a year ago. No that's not true it was when I saw my biological mother which was last May. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities. I'm very strong. Very strong willed. I'm very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent and I'm... Yeah. Anything I regret. I don't think so. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't think too seriously. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends. Either going out a night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar. Somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to and then I have brunch with friends and yeah I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day. What are you most proud of in your life? I am most proud of a few things. I've moved to places that I wanted to move to. I've done things that have really spoken to me. And have meant something to my heart. Achieve those goals. I've done things that I've wanted to do. Move to Ireland and move to California. That's great. Okay I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye. Just a little bit of a survey. Finish up with a quick post survey.",

         " She'll ask you some stuff, but yeah, she can understand. So when she's done, she'll let you know. You can put the door up over here. Hopefully it'll work, but I'll try to... Sometimes my sister can talk to me. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me Feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Boston. Really? When did you move to LA? About 30 years ago. That's a long time. Yep. When do you go back to your hometown? Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Oh, I love living in LA. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. Why did you move to LA? Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. The beginning of the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? Broadcast journalism. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. Are you still working on that? Nope. Why? Well, it's kind of a long story but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just, once I had done that work, I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. Yeah. It could be tough to find a good job these days. Yep. What's your dream job? My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Nice. How hard is that? Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to. I don't travel so much right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like where I'm from. Uh huh. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday because I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international dateline. I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay where native dolphins live and swim. It's very isolated for the most part. I got to be there for a whole weekend pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins. They come and swim with you. It's amazing. It's just a beautiful, beautiful spot in the world. Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More shy. Why? Why? Hmm. That's a good question. Partly the first thing I think of is because I've always been that way. But maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach because I live close to the beach. So that's one of my favorite things to relax. Uh huh. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Um. I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations. But not at people directly. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. I don't know if I feel guilty about anything at the moment. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I'm not sure I have one at the moment. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That just makes me really mad. That sucks. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. You know, I didn't know that I could do it. I didn't, wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. Um. So that felt like a really difficult decision. But in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time, it was really difficult to do that. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment. So that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm great. But it's because I am worried. But you know, I'm also confident that things are going to work out. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either. Sort of like just a even keel. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, I got to go to my friend's work at the Motion Picture Academy, so I get to see all the Oscar-nominated movies. She was there one night, so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again. So that was very pleasant. Nice. How would your best friend describe you? I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. Is there anything you regret? No. I really worked hard on that. I think there are lots of things maybe I would do differently, but there's nothing that really I regret. Like what? Well, I just think that there are things that... Like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good question. Don't worry about the small stuff and save more money. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, you know, the normal things. Like I'd lose more weight and I would... I think be a little more fearless maybe. Be a little more bold. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't think I have any of those. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Well, I am self-employed so I work all the time. So my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something I enjoy. So that would be ideal at this point, my weekends, if I were really busy. What are you most proud of in your life? That I've really been able to take care of myself. And that, you know, I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do. I've done that and I don't have regrets about things. There's nothing really that feels undone in my life. Sure, there's plenty of things I still want to do. But I feel like I've done what I said I was going to do. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, that's not so great. Well, it's okay. Both my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister but they both live on the East Coast and I live in LA. And my sister has two girls so I feel very close to my nieces. Although we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers. So they have other things on their mind. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my teacher, the person I learned my holistic bodywork from. That's so good to hear. How close are you to them? What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? What would be a good mood? Usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or just spending time with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. It worked again. So now I'm going to have you move over to the other computer. So you can do a quick post survey about your experience.",

         " Okay. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions and I'll answer them. And please feel free to comment below and your answers are really comforting. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling okay. I'm a little bit tired but for the most part, I'm feeling pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills, which is out in the San Fernando Valley. I was born there. And then I moved to Lomita, which is in Los Angeles County, about probably around 1993. So, I'm 23 now. So, it's about what, 19 years or so I've been living there. What are some things you really like about LA? Some things that I really like, I would have to say, you know, the beach. You know, not so much the traffic. I don't really care for that. But definitely, you know, just kind of like the nightlife. You know, just people in general. I like conversing with others. So, yeah. I see what you mean. Right. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, actually I do. I mean, I can't see your shoes. But yeah, actually I do travel a lot. I've been to places like Hawaii. I've been to the Caribbean. I've been to, let's see, you know, just different places like Arizona. I've been to Oregon, Washington. Pretty much all over, I would say. But usually mainly like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico as well. What do you enjoy about traveling? I think it's just the experience, you know. Like you can kind of experience the culture, different people, you know. Just the whole background, the scenery. It's just, you know, it's something new to experience, I would say. Something that, you know, people haven't seen before. And what's your favorite part of your trips? Well, let's see. I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago. That was back in December. It was around Christmas time, New Year's. So that was pretty fun. We went to a couple different islands. We went to, let's see, I think it was Kauai. We went to Oahu, Maui, you know, places like that. Nice. What's one thing you're most memorable seeing? You know, I would have to say that, you know, probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean. You know, just like I said before, the whole experience factor. Just seeing, you know, new, different things. Things that are unique. What did you study at school? I actually study journalism right now. In my final semester. So I'm about to graduate. A couple months. That's great. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, it's kind of funny because, you know, I started off at a, you know, a two-year community college. And so, you know, I was going into like business management. Something to do with, you know, I think basically accounting. But, you know, I kind of figured that wasn't for me. So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't, I mean, you know, I'd probably still be sitting at a desk. But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. I would almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. So. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. You know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back. Other times I kind of, it's not so much like I go into my shell, but, you know, at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't, I've never met them before. So it's one of those things that kind of, yeah, kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because, you know, I can neither be talk, very talkative or at times, you know, I can be a little bit shy. But, you know, once I get the conversation going, I'm fairly talkative. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? You know, usually I would listen to music or, you know, maybe just, you know, kind of go for a drive or, you know, hang out with my friends. You know, just something to just to kind of, you know, ease that, you know, because, you know, like I said, sometimes you get a little bit tense and you just want to relax and, you know, just do the things that you enjoy. So. How are you at controlling your temper? You know, I've actually been better with that. A couple years back, you know, there was points where like I pretty much couldn't control my temper, like whatsoever. I mean, I would just pretty much get angry. You know, the littlest things, everything would just kind of tick me off. But, you know, I've I've definitely learned to, you know, control that sort of thing. And, you know, it's made me a better person because of it. Well, let's see. I'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family, with my mother. Maybe it's I can't remember off the top of my head. But, you know, it's it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it. But, you know, eventually we make up and I apologize for it because, you know, I accept that, you know, I'm wrong in certain circumstances. You know. What's something you feel guilty about? Something that I feel guilty about? Probably, you know, not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past. You know, I mean, that is the past and, you know, I don't like to dwell on that sort of thing. But I think that's one thing that I've tried to work on. But it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing. Just being just being nice. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I ever had to make. Pretty recent. Kind of tough because I actually have a buddy. He was in the Air Force and he recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So that was really tough. And it's hard for me to talk to him because, you know, he's not really all there anymore like he used to be. So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that. But at the same time, I don't know his tendencies. He could be a little, you know, crazy. So probably like, you know, some sort of like traumatic stress disorder. Maybe when he was in the military. So I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's pretty tough, you know, because we go way back. I've been best friends with him since I was probably about five, six years old. So it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to deal with. But, you know, I try to, I don't, you know, try to keep in the back of my mind. But, you know, it's always there. I don't ever forget. So, yeah. Okay. How are your best friends friends with you? My best friend? Well, he'd probably say that, you know, I'm a pretty down to earth guy. Usually pretty honest. Sometimes brutally honest. But, you know, I try to work on that too. He'd probably say that I'm pretty funny. I like to hang out, you know, just kind of do things here and there, you know. Just normal activities like any other person. You know, go to the beach, hang out, watch movies, you know, grab a few beers, that sort of deal. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? You know, it varies. Sometimes it's easier than others. You know, if I'm really tired, you know, I'll probably have a very good sleep. I haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days because, you know, my house, there's workers on the roof. So you're putting in the new roofing. So that's kind of tough. So that always wakes me up early in the morning. So sometimes a little bit crabby. But for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep. Okay. How have you been doing lately? Lately, eh, I've been feeling pretty good, you know, because, you know, things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago for, you know, my field of journalism. So that's good. About to graduate in two months. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money. That's, you know, that's good. And, yeah, things are just going pretty well right now. I can't complain. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it's not bad. You know, like I said, it could always be worse, right? But, you know, I'm enjoying life. So that's the best part. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Did it feel down? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy? Man. You know, it was probably going back to my buddy when, you know, he was still, still had his sanity, I guess you could say. You know, he came back to visit from the Air Force. He had some leave. So, you know, we were just hanging out, you know, just kicking back, having a few beers and just talking about life. So that was nice. But I missed that, you know, so. How did you feel when that happened? I felt great, you know, because there's nothing like having a best friend. You can have conversation, you know, 24-7 about anything. You can tell anything to him in confidence. You can tell me anything in confidence. Like, it's hard to find, you know, especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now. So, yeah. Is there anything you regret? Yeah, there's probably one or two things that I regret. Well, I mean, I got a DUI about three or four years ago. Actually, it was four years ago. So that's something that I definitely regret because, you know, I look back on it and, you know, things might have been different. But at the same time, you have to accept, you know, the actions, you know, circumstances that took place. So, you know, I'm manned up and, you know, I guess I think I'm better off for it. But at the same time, you know, it's always going to be in the back of my mind, like I said. It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I usually keep it pretty generic. I tend to hang out with my friends. Either, you know, we hang out in the day, you know, do certain things like, you know, maybe grab a few beers, you know, just have casual conversation, maybe play games, watch movies, you know, just the standard stuff that people do. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Some things that I wish I could change? Probably just, you know, being nicer, like I said before. Maybe not being as lazy, have more determination. I mean, I have quite a bit of determination. I know what I want to do with my life. But I know there are times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical. So I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Well, you know, it's tough to think back. But I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is, you know, I would say probably like when I was, you know, kind of getting angry at certain people, maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have. I was trying to give more constructive criticism, but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things. And they were out of character, so. Okay. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities, I would say that I'm definitely hardworking. I'm determined. I'm very caring now, more than I used to be. Very honest. And, you know, I just, I love to talk to people. Like I like making new relationships. I like making people laugh. That's good. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something that I did recently that I really enjoyed? You know, it was probably over at my internship. I was just, you know, I wrote a story or two. And it just felt good, you know, to get those stories done. And eventually they're going to go into the paper. So I feel accomplished about that. You know, it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there. You know, it's right in your face. And you can tell yourself, you know, like I did that. So it makes me feel good. Yep. What was it about? You know, just let's see. A few different stories. Just usually things about, well, the paper's in Long Beach. So it's usually about, you know, stories or events that are taking place in Long Beach. So, yeah. What are you most proud of in life? I would say that I'm most proud of, you know, graduating high school, about to graduate college. Hopefully, you know, obviously I'm going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job, you know, in the near future. I think that's one thing that I'm most proud of. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay. I'm going to move back to the computer. I'm going to shut all the recording down. And just going to have you fill out a quick post survey about your experience. So we really value your feedback. So we really ask that you take care of your answers.",

I was working at a hot spring resort And I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry Um not hard you don't you don't even think about Difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't Um I guess uh Kind of what I described about this city.

I'm not trying to trap myself with these chains of federal loans So yeah Hey, that's not a good word sucks Um dream job My dream job would be Anything That I can do to alleviate these uh metropolitan like cities from The nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare. My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and With you know physical therapy and artistic expression. I've got some Great ideas Yeah Um I guess more outgoing. I just like I just like experiencing things so outgoing. Yeah Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish cake screensaver Hey, I know it's not hawaii, but it's the best they've got What do you need to do to relax?

I'm gonna go bike riding right there Um Pretty good, I guess i haven't yelled in a long time Um Well, it wasn't arguing I don't I don't really argue much I just like to save my Opinion and have it be understood and I like the person i'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was Uh, I guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and Basically, we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes Things are not ready to be written Yeah, so yesterday Guilty That's tough. I haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt. What about you? What's something you feel guilty about? What Okay I don't really wish I could erase anything from my memory because then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if Something just got erased, you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah Um, maybe the time Um She was going to school I was taking the year off and I was just Kind of hanging around Um, but we had an apartment together with another friend And it didn't turn out You know not all Nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it But this one turned out a little Uh a little different actually quite different than I thought it would be in I thought it was funny. But yeah, it ended up me leaving before the lease ended And it actually ended up Yeah with us separating but that's something I wish Maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully Um, the hardest decision Maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision I had to make was leaving school dropping my Continuation of achieving a bfa Yeah, that could have been the hardest Um It's just uh, I don't I mean, of course money money is the motto money is a big issue Tuition hikes going around the whole nation. Not a fan of that. Not a fan not a fan to support that but um Yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around and um but another reason why I Decided to leave had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because um art institute, you know, that's a It's a funny idea in itself already and basically I was a musician Being taught by a musician to make music And same with you know, all the all the dancers or the theater students, you know getting taught dance To a dancer from a dancer how to dance, you know and it's just um Yeah, it's just not quite as artistic as I thought Art would be art Art comes from somewhere uh, somewhere sweet and deep and purple And not not from out there, you know, so yeah If I If I um It's kind of easy. I mean it depends, you know if I remember to make some chamomile tea or if I Remember to breathe and go through my mantras or Remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then I can get into it real nice. Um But if I just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until I remember to breathe Yeah Um, yeah, basically just what I said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if I Get the lucky chance to be uh Medicated from you know a nice a nice indica Then it really does, you know indica does put me down pretty nice Pretty drowsy. So A lot of things breathing, you know You know medical herbs Like chamomile cannabis and Just uh going just relieving myself of bad bad juju Um, I no I guess not because I can't think of something now I've been feeling Kind of like kind of like this Kind of just cruising On a on a gray line, but it's a nice gray. It's a really nice hue Um, some people wouldn't like this, but I really like that and it's uh It's stable Yeah, it's comfortable yeah No, no I haven't Not by a certified medical professional no, but no I haven't Um Yeah, I mean I just think like the whole You know, like you said ptsd depression and you know other, you know mental instabilities. I think Everybody is depressed. I think everybody is overjoyed. I think everybody's angry.

         " Okay. There we go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. I'm doing fine. Indiana. Yes. I don't know, maybe 10 years ago. Never. I just don't like the cold weather. Okay. LA has beautiful weather and activities all the time. New life. Weasibly easy. The ocean. There's always something to do. The traffic. Sometimes. New places. Visiting new people. A couple years ago I went to Catalina Islands for my birthday. I took a boat there. I'll be on an airplane and leaving Indiana for good. Okay. Sleeping. Being a filmmaker. Because it's one job I haven't had yet. Not too hard. Shy. Because of my past. I just have trouble making new friends and just trusting people. Okay. Watch TV or go to the movies. I don't have a temper. When I was 16, my stepfather. I was just having nightmares about my childhood. About involving my biological father. How do you cope with that? When was the last time that happened? How did you feel in that moment? Okay. Pushing people away. I guess try to trust them a little bit more. I guess try to live them in my life a little bit more. Would that be easy? That would be the first half of my life. I guess it would be easy to start a new life if I can't remember my old one. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. All my decisions are not that hard. I just try to avoid stress and everything. So I don't really have hard decisions. Tell me about a situation you wish you would handle differently. Where every time I push someone away, I wish I handle all those situations differently. Can you example that? Whenever someone gets too involved in my life, I always say or do something to make them want to stay away from me. Like what? Depending on the type of person they are. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I really don't have a relationship with any of my family. I know I have a sister someplace in Vegas, a half of a brother in Indiana, my step-father is in Arizona. Other than that, I have no relationship with any of them. Can you tell me about that? We really don't talk, so it's kind of hard to talk about it. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Agri-Casey. I'd love to hear all about it. Well, he died way before I was born, and I only know him from books and documentaries. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Really not that easy. It's usually taking me a few hours to finally get to sleep once I lay down on my bed. Tell me about that. What are you like when you don't sleep well? How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been feeling a little bit upset, and my life was different. Can you tell me about that? Well, I wish I had friends and loved ones and all that, and I wish I had an actual relationship and everything, but I don't. Have you ever studied to use an abbreviated or a constant? Well, lately I removed a bunch of things on my life, stressful things like bills and whatnot, and just tried to make sure there's the least amount of stress in my life by removing these different things in my life and trying to incorporate new things. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? How long ago were you diagnosed? What got you to sleep out? Do you still get the therapy now? How is seeing a therapist affecting you? Well, basically I just got rid of them on my life because I didn't feel like they were really listening to me or anything. So I just didn't feel too much beneficial help from them, so I've been looking for alternative means. Like what? Well, basically like music and forcing myself to go to different social related events. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. What were your symptoms? Depress. Basically just depressed, keeping myself locked in, not talking to anyone. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I guess a few days ago. Okay. Well, basically I feel that the best way to keep people in my life is having fake people in my life by playing online multiplayer games with avatars and usernames and everything. I just have somewhat fun going to these virtual worlds with these avatars and talking to people that way so they don't know who I really am. They don't even know my real name. Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Okay. Well, my ideal weekend. Let me see. If I'm not working that weekend, I will get up, maybe go to like Starbucks or McDonald's, get online while eating or drinking something, maybe play an online multiplayer game for a little while. And then later on in the day, maybe go to a movie, wherever it's playing, then go someplace else, relax, watch some TV, and maybe put on a DVD movie. Or I might spend a whole day driving to someplace I haven't been before or it's been a long time since I've been. And try to spend the day in that area. And yeah, so that's the weekend. My life. I just regret how my life turned out. I was, I wish I had a more normal stable life. Let me see. 10, 20 years ago, I was this basically. I'll just tell myself to keep a journal or to basically tell myself how my life turned out now. So that way, hopefully the other me will make different choices. My mind. Well, I was, I wish I was a bit healthier. I wish I looked a little bit better. I wish my eyesight was a lot better. And I wish I had a bunch of people in my life that I could call friends. I'm a freaking genius. I could. Everything that I'm good at, I learned self taught. So basically I can't get a career in that type of stuff unless I go to school for it. But it's hard to it's basically easier if I teach myself, then I take some type of a class to do it. And everything because yeah, yeah, just basically the fact I'm a freaking genius. Okay. Thank you. Have a good day. Okay. Yeah.",

         " So now she's going to chat with you for a bit. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty well. I have some stressful circumstances going on, but right now I'm engaged. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Minnesota. Really? Mm-hmm. When did you move to LA? 31 years ago. That's a long time. Half my life. How often do you go back to your hometown? Frequently I've been back there quite a bit, but over the years not that often. How does it compare to LA? Well, it's a whole different experience. I go back there to see my family and old friends. LA is home. It's nice to return here. That's good. Why did you move to LA? To be an actor. Are you still doing that? I'm just actually getting around to it. I was in another business for 25 years, and now finally I can't put it off anymore. What made you decide to do that? The economy. It's easy to find work in show business, it seems, as it is any of the other jobs I've done in the past. Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? A whole variety of things, but mostly having to do with theater. What's your dream job? To be a successful actor would be nice. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. With elements of shyness. I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Well, I read and I cook. That's about it. I'm a big radio listener to talk radio, national public radio, and more not crazy stuff. Sensible listening, nice content, interesting human interest. Like what? Oh, well I'm also a comedian, and so I like to listen to radio shows that have comedy. How are you at controlling yourself? I'm pretty good. I mean, I'm not perfect. I can get very upset. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Oh, probably with my wife about my methods of job hunting and like that. How hard is that? It's difficult. We're very different and have very different MOs. For me to do things my way is not always easy. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. Well, just the other night I was performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to introduce myself to a very famous person and I didn't do it. Why? I'm not sure. I guess I didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him. I miss him. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I can't think of one. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I've been married for 24 years in July, which is a couple of months. My wife and I have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years. We have a very high achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school this spring. She's just gotten accepted at a college that she wants to go to with a very nice scholarship. That's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Yeah. Well, my daughter's been very low maintenance for me, perhaps more so for my wife, but she's always been an excellent child. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Well, we're more similar, I think, than different. I'm much more aware of what's happening in the world and much more informed than my parents were. But in terms of child rearing, I think we've all been kind of hands-off. My wife has been more hands-on. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Well, the financial responsibility. I think it's wanting to make sure that your child has everything that her peers have and not wanting her to not have the same as her friends. And she has very wealthy friends. I am not a gifted moneymaker. It's a struggle, but we keep up. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. That sort of put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that were kind of dictated by my upbringing. Like what? Oh, just instead of working for somebody else, being able to start a business and be in business for yourself and to not be dependent on just one source of income. Okay. Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Oh. Meeting one particular woman when I first got out here. Tell me about that. She left me less than healthy physically. I self-medicate to go to sleep, which I probably don't have to do, but about half the nights I wake up much earlier than I would like to. Why? Oh, mostly to have to go to the bathroom. Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Well, I cope pretty well. I guess I'm just not quite as functional as I'd like to be. There are a couple of nights a week when I work until two o'clock in the morning and don't get to bed until three. Normally I need seven hours if I only get five or six and I'm sluggish. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Very anxious. Can you tell me about that? Well, I have big bills to pay and not a lot of income coming in. That sounds really high. Yeah, it's because I don't like to fall behind. I feel like I'm worried about losing ground and the stakes are high. It's an uncomfortable position. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I am a classic depressive. Yeah, I guess I have. I do see a therapist. Though the therapist I'm seeing now is not trying to prescribe drugs or medications. Previous ones have. How long ago were you diagnosed? Probably six years ago. What got you into seeing help? Well, my wife kind of pushed me into it. She thought it was a way of, I think, getting help finding work. It's not. It's just I enjoyed having someone to talk to. Not really. What were your symptoms? I was just having a lot of trouble with the struggle. Displeasure with my life. Do you still have a therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Their what? Do you feel like therapy is useful? I don't understand that word. Have you noticed anything on your head? Well, I... It's something I look forward to because I feel like I'm talking to someone who understands me. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I can't. I don't know. Each little acting gig that I get makes me happy, but just mildly happy. They usually turn out to be disappointing experiences. I'm never over-excited with happiness. Tell me about something you've been doing that you really enjoy. Yesterday I made a dessert to celebrate my daughter's scholarship. It was delicious and we really enjoyed that. That's so good to hear. Is there anything you're about? No. Except meeting that one woman. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Probably try a little harder. I had started this business around that time. It was difficult, but we were successful at it. I guess I could have gotten it rolling even more so that it wouldn't be so dead today. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. What are you most proud of about your mother? I'm going for the big apple. I hope to be successful there too. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.",

I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Kind of down. Why? I don't have a boyfriend. Don't have money. I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you from originally? Florida. Really? Yep. What did you do in LA? I tried to find work. How often do you go back to your hometown? About once a year. That's good. How does it compare to LA? More boring. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Not easy. Can you tell me about that? It's hard when you don't have enough money to get your own place, so I have to live with roommates. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. The scenery. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. It's too expensive to have your own place by your own. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I want to. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different places, different cultures, the buildings, the food and stuff. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I drove from Florida over here. I drove to the South. I went to Alabama. People are nicer in Louisiana. People are really nice. Then Mississippi, then Texas, then Arizona, then California. I got to see the country a little bit. Awesome. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess traveling through the country. I went to Louisiana. People are really nice in a small town called Jennings. People are always happy and fun. That's great. What did you study at school? I just went to high school. That was the basic stuff. What's your dream job? I don't know. My dream job? I'm an interior designer to the stars. Really? Yep. Why? Because they have enough money to get the furniture and I get to keep the free furniture too. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Upgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV, funny TV shows. Like what? Sometimes Big Bang Theory or sometimes a funny movie on TV. Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Where I used to live about two weeks ago, I had to move out. I moved in there and he told me that he didn't have any marijuana or marijuana plants because he didn't want to be around. He had that so I had to move out because he had a self-in-living room. Yeah, it does. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and him would handle differently. I don't know. Good question. Probably... Probably, I don't know, probably with an ex-boyfriend. We broke up. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, it's in the past. I'm over him. He was a jerk anyway. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision? Leaving home? Tell me about that. Well, I could try a better life out here in California but I miss home. Yeah, I'm sorry. Isn't it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yep. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? My roommates don't have the TV on now. It's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. I'm lazier during the day. Uh-huh. How have you been feeling lately? Frustrated. Why? I'm poor. I don't want to be. I see. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just more sad. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Wow. Um... It's been a while. It's been like, god, more over two years. Can you tell me about that? Um, I didn't have any money problems. I was doing fine. Um, yep. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? Oh, what did I do? Um, I was with my cats at home here in California and they're playing outside. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend would be nice. Um, at the beach eating at a nice restaurant. Is there anything you regret? No. Not. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't spend so much money. You'll need it in the future. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Save money. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, my bank account. How would your best friend describe you? Um, it's a nice person. You were very young, weren't you? And what? What? What are you most proud of in your life? Um, um, I'm gonna push that out now. Um, I persevere. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, I'd rather not. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh, me a few years ago. I was more like a mentor and um, taught me some things. Like what? Never complain. Be thankful for everything you have. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Um, my eyes? People say I have pretty eyes. Um, like a dress up. What are some things you like to do for fun? For fun? I like to try surfing. Go shopping. Maybe go to art galleries. That's good. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye! Bye!

What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. I like the people. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. That's primarily it. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Sociology. Really? Yep. How did you decide to do that? It's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects. Are you still working on that? No. What's your dream job? To be a writer. Can you tell me about that? I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in. Like what? Like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. What do you think of today's kids? I think they have it pretty easy. They don't know how easy they have it. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not really. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing like watch TV. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long. Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. Why? Because they basically sort of raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much. I understand. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and them would different me. I can't really think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about me that or something that you wish you could erase from the memory. I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not really super easy. I sort of, I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh, last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends describing you? Probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh, no. I don't think. There's not, I don't think, I think regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't try to, don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, sometimes, sometimes I can be kind of lazy. Uh, I'd like to have more of a, um, like sort of a better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh, just sort of putting off stuff until, you know, right when it's due or after it's due, things like that. Um, procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh, sometimes for the things that I write, uh, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I guess I'm most proud of the fact that, uh, I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, just hanging out with my friends, uh, sort of people watching, watching a movie that's good, um, listening to music. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye.",

         " Okay. Great. Thanks. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? California, here in Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I love being near the beach. I love the beach. I love living in a big city. And I love the fact that I have lots of friends and family here. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Just so many, sometimes too many people. But apart from that, I'm generally happy here. Okay. What did you study at school? Photography and language studies. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I love photography. I was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well. So I wanted to continue to learn more about it. And with languages, I come from a mixed background. So I wanted to learn languages of my ethnic background. How hard is that? It wasn't hard. It was a passion. So I enjoyed it. Are you still working on that? I'm not. What's your dream job? To do photography full time. And also to do some of the things that I'm passionate about more creatively. More creative things. Like what? I have an idea. I'd like to make a robe line. Women's robes and things like that. Awesome. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I have. I love travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different cultures, different countries, meeting new people. All of that. And the language. I lived in Greece for over a year. I taught English there. And moved around to different parts of Greece. And really had a great time. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think just having my group of friends that I met there. And going through the experience with them. I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to Elefonisos in a car with everybody. And having just a fantastic time. That sounds like a great situation. Yes it was. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm shy to begin with. And as I get to know people that I'm much more outgoing. What do you study at school? Photography and language studies. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I just stay at home. Maybe watch a movie. Rest in bed. Watching a movie in bed. That's probably one of the things I like to do to relax. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I think very good. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? It was probably with my boyfriend. Regarding money issues. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now. Can you tell me about that? I'm having some struggles in my career right now. Financially, it's becoming very difficult. I'm sorry. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it has been difficult. But I've been working very hard to remedy that. That's great. Can you give me an example of that? While I'm here, I'm doing this focus study. I'm doing many things to generate more money, working harder, but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my career. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Probably being raped. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Sometimes. Are they triggered by something? Not that I'm aware of. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling stressed. I've been feeling stressed and worried. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't seem to have any problem with it. I seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Grumpy and lethargic in the morning. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Hmm. A situation I wish I would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was probably deciding to not have a child. Can you tell me about that? Well, I was pregnant and wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy. That was also due to financial burden. The father who I was involved with did not want the child. So I made that very, very difficult decision. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Really, really happy. I know. When I went to Cancun on a holiday over the New Year period. New Year holiday. How did you feel in that moment? I felt absolutely fantastic. I felt happy. I felt relaxed. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world temporarily. Free. That's great. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive. Definitely more assertive. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I would say I'm a wonderful, wonderful friend. I love somebody. I love them very deeply. Friends, family, boyfriend. I think that's good. I'm very loyal as a friend. I'm honest. I care about people. I'm fun to be with. I think those are some of my best qualities. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, with my father, is not so great. My parents were divorced when I was young. He's sort of been in and out of my life forever. Mostly out. It's not fantastic, but it's something that I'm used to. It's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then I lost him. It's still not the best situation. I still wish that could be remedied somehow. There's good and bad relationships in my family. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. I love someone that's been there for me since I was very, very young. It's always been just incredible. I love her so much. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun. So I don't have to work so hard now. Is there anything you regret? I regret exactly that. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on. Because now it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them. Making them happy. That was probably one of the best times in the last few weeks. Tell me about your kids. They're great kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No, I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren. There are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. We're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot. But it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them or overpunish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child. It was really difficult so I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to travel the world and live in other places, many, many other places around the country and around the world. The fact that I learned several languages. The fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Wow.",

         " Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Virginia. Really? When did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more diversity. How often do you go back to your hometown? Once a year maybe. How does it compare to LA? It's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there. Why did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer, warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and there's a lot more going on. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? For me it was really easy because I wanted something very different and I wanted something different. What are some things you really like about LA? I like all the things to do, like the museums, I like the beaches and the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? People that don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back and bad drivers. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I would like to. I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to that much. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places. My wife and I like to see wildlife and hike and monuments and just seeing different areas. Cool. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. We went to Central California. We'd like to be able to go more internationally but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally. We went to Hearst Castle to see the elephant seals and things like that. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary. We did the tram and a nice hotel on the Jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I guess somewhere in between. What did you study at school? English and film. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, I was told I needed to go to college and I hadn't quite decided what to do yet so I just picked something I liked to do for the time being. Are you happy you did that? Well, I wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to. I might have done something different like physical therapy. Are you still working on that? No, I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before. Wow. What made you decide to do that? I needed to not starve and it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and it ended up being kind of fun. That's good. What's your dream job? Dream job is to have money and not have to work for it. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Overall, pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I don't remember what it was about but it probably would have been a few weeks ago with my wife. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled, I always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone's not listening it drives me crazy. Can you give me an example of that? If I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening, it makes me really upset. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I don't know. I spend a lot of time on them but I don't know what the hardest one is because if I decide to go with something it's usually for a good reason. Uh huh. What's something you feel guilty about? Well, I guess I feel guilty about moving to California and that I left my family in Virginia. I mean, I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there, you know, I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them. How hard is that? Well, I mean, I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a good relationship with my wife, with my in-laws, with my mom, dad and sister. There's no problems. Everyone gets along well. How close are you to your family? Very close. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Um, I mean anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Depends on how much exercise I have. I get a lot of exercise. It's pretty easy. If I don't, it's not. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, kind of like right now just a little bit slowing out of it but not really too different otherwise. Uh huh. How have you been feeling lately? Um, just kind of run down because my mother-in-law is dying and we just spent like three days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep. I'm sorry. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Just slower and more tired and a little more out of it. That's all. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, usually just when I'm having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's pretty easy for me. Just getting outside and hiking or exercising is not hard for me. How would your best friend describe you? I'm not sure. Maybe um, maybe like eccentric but in a good way. Hopefully. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be careful with your job to make sure you can keep from being injured and to, I don't know, just your normal kind of older kind of wisdom. Can you tell me about that? Not much to say really. Everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back in the shape like I used to be. That's the biggest thing right now. Can you tell me more about that? Um, not much to say. Just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it because it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things. That's all. Like what? Well like I used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit because it hurts too much. That sucks. Tell me how you spend your entire weekend. Um, probably like during the day going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then at night you know we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I'm most proud of um, proud of moving here. I mean I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something I regretted but I came out and I've always thought that was a good decision. That's good. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. My parents, my grandparents, my wife, most people in my life have been. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye bye. Okay. I'm going to switch to the other computer where we're going to have you do a quick post-script about your experience.",

The destination. I don't enjoy the traveling anymore at all. I did when I was young, but no longer. It's the destination point. I'd love to hear about all your trips. Okay. In 92, I went to Spain. My grandma, my father's mother was born in Spain. I went back to trace her roots. I spent a week in Madrid, a week in Barcelona, and a week in Mallorca. I had a great time. That's great. What's the best memorable experiences? It was an everyday thing. People were friendly. Finding out some of the things about my grandmother and her family were interesting.

Have you done anything to avoid it? Tell me about a situation that you wish you had had a different room. My second marriage probably. She wanted to have children. I already had my children with my first wife. I had told her initially that I did not want to have children. I had three. I was good with that. She indicated that she did not want to have children. So we got married and then her best friend got pregnant. And our relationship changed. I basically wouldn't relent and we ended up getting divorced. I don't know that I would have had children with her, but I wasn't very flexible in the process. How hard is that? What, to be flexible? I don't know. Sometimes I am, sometimes I'm not. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. What made you decide to do that? Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Can you tell me about that? I see. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? What are you like when you don't sleep well? How have you been feeling lately? Wow.

         "I remember a period in my life, not that long ago, when I was very unhappy with most of my existence for a very long time. In fact, I used to think I had depression, though who knows at this point. During those years, I often felt a deep sense of guilt about many things, particularly about eating, because I really love junk food and have very little food power. I even used to see myself as a 'bad guy.'\n\nDaily life had its challenges. Getting to bed was always the hard part for me, though once I'm asleep, I'm pretty much out until something major, like an earthquake, hits. So, I'd say I sleep poorly, but I've become a pro at it over most of my life, even if it means my dark circles get a bit larger. Socially, I used to be a definite introvert; it wasn't easy for me to connect with people.\n\nA major turning point for me was moving to Los Angeles back in May 2007. That's when things really started to get fun, and it feels like ancient history now. Finding the right group of friends here made it easy to be social, and for the first time, I became an extrovert, even outgoing and bombastic, and that stuck. Now, I'm feeling incredibly excited and inspired, though I still wish I could just work on my motivation to be completely set. When I'm really stressed out, I usually try to enlist my friends to help me with an art project – that's a good way for me to cope. I've been through some tough stuff, like leaving Los Angeles after my ex and best friend did a whole bunch of nasty things, but even that pushed me to do it. It's been a spoiled, blessed life, and I like this universe.",

So when she's done, she'll let you know and then you can let me know. Okay. Thanks. Looks good. Thanks. I'm going to go ahead and move this cord behind you just so it doesn't get any away. Hi. Hello. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions. And I'm so grateful that you're here. I'm so grateful that you're here. I'm so grateful that you're here. I'm so grateful that you're here.

I'm so grateful that you're here. I'm so grateful that you're here. I'm so grateful that you're here. Okay. Not too bad. I'm from Chicago, Southside. Back in 1978, when I was 18. Completely not much. Maybe once every two or three years. How does it compare to LA? It's totally different. You know, horrible weather and yeah, it's just a whole different atmosphere. Why do you live in LA? Let's see. My mother had moved to Africa. I graduated from high school and I had a friend out here. So I just thought, well, let me try LA. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy actually. Yeah. I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane. Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Number one, the weather. Sun is very important to me. I love the weather. I don't know. Just kind of a more laid back atmosphere. Variety of people. And now it's my home base. My friends that are family. So it's kind of like my family is here now. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Hmm. I guess the small earthquakes. Traffic. Just basic things like that really. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I don't currently, but I did throughout my life. I traveled quite a lot. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and just the fun of it as well. I'd love to hear about when you're friends. Let's see. Well, one trip I went to England, Ireland, Scotland, and France. All in one trip. So that was a nice variety. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess you could say probably skiing in Val d'Azur, France. That was fun. I'm glad I got to do that. That's great. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm kind of shy by nature. I've tried to grow out of being shy, so I'm not fully shy, but I was always an extremely shy child. Now here in Culver City, this is my environment, and I guess you could say I'm not really shy in my hometown of Culver City. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? To relax? I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book, take a nap, watch TV, sometimes on the couch in the living room, just stay at home and kind of vegetate. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good, yeah. My temper's pretty level. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Hmm. Probably with my husband, and I can't remember at the moment what it was about. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, when you say my family, do you mean my family from childhood or my current family? Whatever comes to your mind. Okay, well, I guess my current family comes to mind. I have two daughters, and my relationship's pretty good. It's okay with them, but they're teenagers, which they're going through a lot of hormones, and they can be kind of bitchy. But I have hope that they'll grow out of that and someday we'll have a really good relationship. And then there's the husband, which I guess I could say soon to be ex-husband, hopefully soon. We need to get a divorce, but we're still together due to financial reasons. And yeah, so that's not good, the relationship with the husband. But since we have determined that we need to divorce, we don't expect anything out of each other, so we don't argue as much, so that's good. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and them would differently. Hmm. Wow. I guess our marriage, I wish I had noticed early on that, you know, it was like way off from what I thought it was. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Um, let's see, oh my God. Hardest decision. I guess leaving my first husband, that was pretty hard. Can you tell me about that? Um, well, you know, we were married and I wasn't content, I guess you could say. Um, and I kind of just gave up on our relationship and I, now that I look back, I think it's because I wanted children and he would have been happy to never have any. And so, since I didn't have a father, it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father. And so, I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children, yet I was with someone who really was not into it. So, I think that's one, maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work. So, you know, we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up. And I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was very hard because, you know, I felt like I was hurting him, which I was. You know, he survived, he got over it, now he's married with two kids. But it was hard to leave him. Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Something I wish I could erase from my memory. I have to think about that. I'm sure there's something. Oh, well, yeah, there's, I guess it would be nice to erase from my memory a recent, I'm not recent, but an event in my recent adulthood here in Culver City, where one of my best friends, I've betrayed me by, back years ago when my husband first got into real estate, she and her family were growing and they really needed a larger home. And we just assumed, you know, that they would use my husband as their agent, both to sell their current home, current at the time, and to purchase a new home. And as it turned out, they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent. And yeah, that was devastating. I don't think I had ever been betrayed like that. So I wish I could erase that. Because now, you know, this was back when the kids were really young. And my daughter at the time, my youngest daughter was, let's say, six, maybe, maybe five. Anyway, her and my best friend's daughter are the same age. They were born within days of each other. We were pregnant together. And they were really tight, those two little girls. And they ended up not going to the same elementary school, so they didn't get to hang out during those years. But every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd run into each other at a summer camp or something, they were just so connected. They were just, you know, like two peas in a pod, even though their moms weren't talking to each other anymore. So now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together. And they're still very connected. In fact, she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl. And it's just a little awkward, you know, because now these girls are becoming really good friends, better friends. And yet, I still have this vivid, bad memory of what her... her mom did to me. That was about, what, 10? About eight years ago. Anyway, I tried to ignore it and put it out of my head, which I've been able to in recent years. But obviously it still comes up. Anyway, that was that. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not that easy. I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep, but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep. And most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep. Or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up, you know, that difficult thing. Well, the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom. And then, you know, it's not always that easy to get back to sleep. And then I wake up again to go to the bathroom. So I guess that's the trigger. As far as getting to sleep, having a hard time there, I don't know, I think there's just too much on my mind. Running through my mind in the day and I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day. So it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to, I guess. Okay. What are you like when you wake up in the morning? Well, I'm kind of used to it now. So I just go on through the day probably looking tired. And I'm kind of used to feeling tired. I just do what I need to do. Sometimes if I'm able to, if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments, yeah, I might just, like I said earlier, just take a nap or something. Read my book, watch TV, whatever. Lately, how have I been feeling? Kind of down on myself, down on life. Can you tell me about that? Well, I have this pending need for separation slash divorce. I've worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls. Now they're teenagers, you know, on the verge of adulthood. And so I worry that, you know, I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood and now it's too late. Like I missed out on a lot of things. And yeah, I need a job, I'm unemployed, I don't know what I want to do with my life. I know I want to do something. I just wish, you know, I never did finish college, unfortunately, because I was traveling and stuff. So I regret that extremely. And I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself because I need to divorce and move on with my life. So now I forget what the original question was, but that's the state, part of the state of my life. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Well, the first time or recently? The first time, I guess, was, you know, when I was in my early 20s, I was just a little upset about it. Coincidentally, that was another breakup I had to make back then. I was in my early 20s and I needed to break up with my boyfriend. But again, it was very upsetting because I, you know, it was hard because he didn't want to break up and I felt like I was hurting him. And I didn't understand this feeling. I was really upset. That was my first time having depression, so I didn't really recognize it as depression. But I went, somehow I had the knowledge or the, I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist. I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me. And so I guess that helped me get through that. And then I've had depression throughout the years, just, you know, little bits here and there for various reasons such as, I guess it's usually a relationship, you know. Yeah, so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds, that was probably about two years ago. Do you still go to therapy now? No. How much do you spend on your stuff? Money. I don't have insurance. Otherwise, yeah, I'd be happy to go to therapy. Anything that might help. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Ooh. Boy. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I guess maybe when my children were born. That's... I guess happy, I don't know. I just, you know, I always wanted children, so it was nice to have them. That's, I don't know, that's all I can remember of that. I guess I don't remember the good times too well. I remember the bad times. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Hmm. Something I did that I really enjoyed. Well, I don't know. Well, let's see, I, Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house. That was fun. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Ooh. Stay in college, get my degree, get therapy, try to become happy. Yeah, try to figure out things earlier in life. Like, yeah. Stay in college and, oh, and meanly, I think the mean, you know, what it all boils down to, no matter what you're depressed about, it seems like, you know, you're depressed about being a little bit of a wimp. And meanly, I think the mean, you know, what it all boils down to, no matter what you're depressed about, it seems like, as the saying goes and the songs go, you know, it's all about money. The world revolves around money and having none, that in itself is very depressing. So besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life, having no money is, you know, it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it. So with that in mind, I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it. Don't quit to go traveling, you know. Just stick with a job, stick with a company, build up your seniority, keep your benefits, and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field. Yeah, that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself. Okay. What are you most proud of in life? Not much. I guess just my daughters, you know, they're beautiful daughters and I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children. Some people aren't even able to do that, you know, and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it. So that's the one thing. I mean, I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy, which I never had, but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of, is having my two daughters. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm a very loyal friend and person. That's why when that friend betrayed me, it was so devastating. Yeah, very loyal, very happy. What was I going to say? I was going to say happy go lucky. I don't know where that came from. I meant to say friendly and caring and yeah, I care about people and I'm interested in people and I care about animals as well. Actually, that's another thing I'm proud of, proud of being a vegetarian. Yeah, so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings, not only humans but animals too. I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them. So what was the question? Do you remember the question? Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to.

We'll go over to the other corner where you will finish up with a quick post survey about your experience.",
         "Okay. Thanks. I'm going to go ahead and move this cord behind you just so it doesn't get any away. So I'm going to put it right here. So when she's done, she'll let you know and then you can let me know. Looks good. Hi. Hello. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions. And I'm so grateful that you're here. Yes. Okay. Not too bad. I'm from Chicago, Southside. Back in 1978, when I was 18. Completely not much. Maybe once every two or three years. How does it compare to LA? It's totally different. You know, horrible weather and yeah, it's just a whole different atmosphere. Why do you live in LA? Let's see. My mother had moved to Africa. I graduated from high school and I had a friend out here. So I just thought, well, let me try LA. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy actually. Yeah. I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane. Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Number one, the weather. Sun is very important to me. I love the weather. I don't know. Just kind of a more laid back atmosphere. Variety of people. And now it's my home base. My friends that are family. So it's kind of like my family is here now. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Hmm. I guess the small earthquakes. Traffic. Just basic things like that really. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I don't currently, but I did throughout my life. I traveled quite a lot. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and just the fun of it as well. I'd love to hear about when you're friends. Let's see. Well, one trip I went to England, Ireland, Scotland, and France. All in one trip. So that was a nice variety. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess you could say probably skiing in Val d'Azur, France. That was fun. I'm glad I got to do that. That's great. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm kind of shy by nature. I've tried to grow out of being shy, so I'm not fully shy, but I was always an extremely shy child. Now here in Culver City, this is my environment, and I guess you could say I'm not really shy in my hometown of Culver City. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? To relax? I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book, take a nap, watch TV, sometimes on the couch in the living room, just stay at home and kind of vegetate. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good, yeah. My temper's pretty level. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Hmm. Probably with my husband, and I can't remember at the moment what it was about. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, when you say my family, do you mean my family from childhood or my current family? Whatever comes to your mind. Okay, well, I guess my current family comes to mind. I have two daughters, and my relationship's pretty good. It's okay with them, but they're teenagers, which they're going through a lot of hormones, and they can be kind of bitchy. But I have hope that they'll grow out of that and someday we'll have a really good relationship. And then there's the husband, which I guess I could say soon to be ex-husband, hopefully soon. We need to get a divorce, but we're still together due to financial reasons. And yeah, so that's not good, the relationship with the husband. But since we have determined that we need to divorce, we don't expect anything out of each other, so we don't argue as much, so that's good. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and them would differently. Hmm. Wow. I guess our marriage, I wish I had noticed early on that, you know, it was like way off from what I thought it was. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Um, let's see, oh my God. Hardest decision. I guess leaving my first husband, that was pretty hard. Can you tell me about that? Um, well, you know, we were married and I wasn't content, I guess you could say. Um, and I kind of just gave up on our relationship and I, now that I look back, I think it's because I wanted children and he would have been happy to never have any. And so, since I didn't have a father, it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father. And so, I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children, yet I was with someone who really was not into it. So, I think that's one, maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn't going to work. So, you know, we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up. And I had to leave him because I just wasn't happy and that was very hard because, you know, I felt like I was hurting him, which I was. You know, he survived, he got over it, now he's married with two kids. But it was hard to leave him. Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Something I wish I could erase from my memory. I have to think about that. I'm sure there's something. Oh, well, yeah, there's, I guess it would be nice to erase from my memory a recent, I'm not recent, but an event in my recent adulthood here in Culver City, where one of my best friends, I've betrayed me by, back years ago when my husband first got into real estate, she and her family were growing and they really needed a larger home. And we just assumed, you know, that they would use my husband as their agent, both to sell their current home, current at the time, and to purchase a new home. And as it turned out, they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent. And yeah, that was devastating. I don't think I had ever been betrayed like that. So I wish I could erase that. Because now, you know, this was back when the kids were really young. And my daughter at the time, my youngest daughter was, let's say, six, maybe, maybe five. Anyway, her and my best friend's daughter are the same age. They were born within days of each other. We were pregnant together. And they were really tight, those two little girls. And they ended up not going to the same elementary school, so they didn't get to hang out during those years. But every time we'd run into them in the neighborhood or they'd run into each other at a summer camp or something, they were just so connected. They were just, you know, like two peas in a pod, even though their moms weren't talking to each other anymore. So now they're 13 and 14 and they're in middle school together. And they're still very connected. In fact, she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl. And it's just a little awkward, you know, because now these girls are becoming really good friends, better friends. And yet, I still have this vivid, bad memory of what her... her mom did to me. That was about, what, 10? About eight years ago. Anyway, I tried to ignore it and put it out of my head, which I've been able to in recent years. But obviously it still comes up. Anyway, that was that. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not that easy. I do sometimes get a decent night's sleep, but sometimes it's hard to get to sleep. And most of the time I wake up and can't get back to sleep. Or I finally get back to sleep and then it's almost time to get up, you know, that difficult thing. Well, the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom. And then, you know, it's not always that easy to get back to sleep. And then I wake up again to go to the bathroom. So I guess that's the trigger. As far as getting to sleep, having a hard time there, I don't know, I think there's just too much on my mind. Running through my mind in the day and I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day. So it's hard for me to just go to sleep when I'm supposed to, I guess. Okay. What are you like when you wake up in the morning? Well, I'm kind of used to it now. So I just go on through the day probably looking tired. And I'm kind of used to feeling tired. I just do what I need to do. Sometimes if I'm able to, if I'm at home and don't have huge commitments, yeah, I might just, like I said earlier, just take a nap or something. Read my book, watch TV, whatever. Lately, how have I been feeling? Kind of down on myself, down on life. Can you tell me about that? Well, I have this pending need for separation slash divorce. I've worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls. Now they're teenagers, you know, on the verge of adulthood. And so I worry that, you know, I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance and their early childhood and now it's too late. Like I missed out on a lot of things. And yeah, I need a job, I'm unemployed, I don't know what I want to do with my life. I know I want to do something. I just wish, you know, I never did finish college, unfortunately, because I was traveling and stuff. So I regret that extremely. And I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself because I need to divorce and move on with my life. So now I forget what the original question was, but that's the state, part of the state of my life. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Well, the first time or recently? The first time, I guess, was, you know, when I was in my early 20s, I was just a little upset about it. Coincidentally, that was another breakup I had to make back then. I was in my early 20s and I needed to break up with my boyfriend. But again, it was very upsetting because I, you know, it was hard because he didn't want to break up and I felt like I was hurting him. And I didn't understand this feeling. I was really upset. That was my first time having depression, so I didn't really recognize it as depression. But I went, somehow I had the knowledge or the, I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist. I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me. And so I guess that helped me get through that. And then I've had depression throughout the years, just, you know, little bits here and there for various reasons such as, I guess it's usually a relationship, you know. Yeah, so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds, that was probably about two years ago. Do you still go to therapy now? No. How much do you spend on your stuff? Money. I don't have insurance. Otherwise, yeah, I'd be happy to go to therapy. Anything that might help. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Ooh. Boy. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I guess maybe when my children were born. That's... I guess happy, I don't know. I just, you know, I always wanted children, so it was nice to have them. That's, I don't know, that's all I can remember of that. I guess I don't remember the good times too well. I remember the bad times. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Hmm. Something I did that I really enjoyed. Well, I don't know. Well, let's see, I, Friday night I went to a friend's house and met up with five other girlfriends and we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house. That was fun. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Ooh. Stay in college, get my degree, get therapy, try to become happy. Yeah, try to figure out things earlier in life. Like, yeah. Stay in college and, oh, and I think what it all boils down to, no matter what you're depressed about, it seems like, you know, you're depressed about being a little bit of a wimp. As the saying goes and the songs go, you know, it's all about money. The world revolves around money and having none, that in itself is very depressing. So besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life, having no money is, you know, it's like you can't even try to fix anything because you don't have the money to fix it. So with that in mind, I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it. Don't quit to go traveling, you know. Just stick with a job, stick with a company, build up your seniority, keep your benefits, and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of field. Yeah, that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself. Okay. What are you most proud of in life? Not much. I guess just my daughters, you know, they're beautiful daughters and I'm proud and glad that I was able to have children. Some people aren't even able to do that, you know, and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it. So that's the one thing. I mean, I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy, which I never had, but I guess that's the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of, is having my two daughters. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm a very loyal friend and person. That's why when that friend betrayed me, it was so devastating. Yeah, very loyal, very happy. What was I going to say? I was going to say happy go lucky. I don't know where that came from. I meant to say friendly and caring and yeah, I care about people and I'm interested in people and I care about animals as well. Actually, that's another thing I'm proud of, proud of being a vegetarian. Yeah, so my daughters and being vegetarian and I'm a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings, not only humans but animals too. I don't think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them. So what was the question? Do you remember the question? Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Bye. I did need the tissue one time, so that's good. I'm going to stop recording now. Okay. We'll go over to the other corner where you will finish up with a quick post survey about your experience.",
         "Here’s a summary of my experience with depression:\n\nLately, I've been feeling pretty down on myself and down on life. It’s not a new feeling for me; I was first diagnosed with depression in my early twenties. Back then, it was triggered by a difficult breakup, and I didn't even recognize it as depression, just a profound upset. I sought help and was prescribed Xanax, which helped me get through that period. Since then, I've had bouts of depression throughout the years, often for various reasons, but usually tied to relationships. The most recent time I was formally diagnosed and put on medication was about two years ago, and I'm still on those meds, though I don't go to therapy now because I don't have insurance.\n\nMy current struggles are heavily influenced by my pending separation and divorce. My relationship with my husband isn't good, and we're still together due to financial reasons, which isn't ideal. This financial instability is a huge source of stress. I'm unemployed, and I don't know what I want to do with my life. I never finished college, and I regret that extremely. I feel like I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself so I can divorce and move on. I believe that having no money is incredibly depressing; it feels like you can't even try to fix anything because you lack the means. I also worry a lot about my daughters, who are teenagers now. I fear I made many mistakes with their guidance and in their early childhood, and I worry it's too late to correct them.\n\nSleep is a major challenge for me. It's not easy to get a good night's sleep. Sometimes it's hard to fall asleep because there's 'too much on my mind,' and I feel like I haven't accomplished enough during the day. Most of the time, I wake up in the middle of the night, usually to go to the bathroom, and then I can't get back to sleep easily. I'm kind of used to feeling tired all the time, and I just push through the day. When I can, I cope by staying home, curling up in bed to read, take a nap, or watch TV – just kind of 'vegetating.'\n\nI find it hard to remember the good times; I tend to remember the bad ones. When asked about the last time I felt really happy, I could only think of when my children were born, and even then, I just said it was 'nice to have them.' Recently, I did enjoy going to a friend's house to make vision boards with other girlfriends, which was fun.\n\nA significant past event that still affects me is a betrayal by one of my best friends about eight years ago, related to a real estate deal. It was devastating, and even though I try to ignore it and put it out of my head, the vivid bad memory still comes up, especially now that our daughters are becoming closer friends.\n\nOverall, I feel a sense of deep regret about past choices, particularly not finishing college and not securing my financial future. I wish I had figured things out earlier in life and been less of a 'wimp,' as I see it. I'm not proud of much in my life, beyond my daughters and being a vegetarian, which reflects my caring nature towards others.",

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. That's good. Where are you from originally? California. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. I like the people. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. That's primarily it. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Sociology. Really? Yep. How did you decide to do that? It's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects. Are you still working on that? No. What's your dream job? To be a writer. Can you tell me about that? I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in. Like what? Like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. What do you think of today's kids? I think they have it pretty easy. They don't know how easy they have it. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not really. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing like watch TV. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long. Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. Why? Because they basically sort of raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much. I understand. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and them would different me. I can't really think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about me that or something that you wish you could erase from the memory. I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not really super easy. I sort of, I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh, last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends describing you? Probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh, no. I don't think. There's not, I don't think, I think regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't try to, don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, sometimes, sometimes I can be kind of lazy. Uh, I'd like to have more of a, um, like sort of a better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh, just sort of putting off stuff until, you know, right when it's due or after it's due, things like that. Um, procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh, sometimes for the things that I write, uh, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I guess I'm most proud of the fact that, uh, I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, just hanging out with my friends, uh, sort of people watching, watching a movie that's good, um, listening to music. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye.",

I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. Why? Because they basically sort of raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much. I understand. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and them would different me. I can't really think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about me that or something that you wish you could erase from the memory. I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yes. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not really super easy. I sort of, I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh, last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends describing you? Probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh, no. I don't think. Regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, sometimes I can be kind of lazy. Uh, I'd like to have more of a, um, like sort of a better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh, just sort of putting off stuff until, you know, right when it's due or after it's due, things like that. Um, procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh, sometimes for the things that I write, uh, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I guess I'm most proud of the fact that, uh, I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, just hanging out with my friends, uh, sort of people watching, watching a movie that's good, um, listening to music. Okay. I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye.",
         "I'm doing well today, and generally, I'd say I've been feeling normal and fine lately, with no complaints. I haven't noticed any significant changes in my behavior or thoughts; things have been pretty much the same as ever. In fact, I haven't been diagnosed with depression, nor with PTSD.\n\nJust last night, I was really happy hanging out with my friends, sharing stories and laughing. Spending time with them, watching good movies, people-watching, and listening to music are things that usually put me in a good mood. My best friends would probably describe me as funny, easy to get along with, and caring. My ideal weekend is pretty relaxed, just sitting around reading, going to the movies, or watching TV.\n\nWhile my mood is generally stable, I do feel bad when people write negative comments about my writing online. I also carry a bit of guilt about not talking to my grandparents as much as I feel I should, especially since they largely raised me and my grandmother was a strong, positive influence in my life. The death of my sister was also a really traumatizing experience for me. I also went through a hard divorce, but I feel I made the right decision. Overall, I'm satisfied with myself, my friends, and my place in the world, and I'm proud to feel comfortable with that.\n\nWhen it comes to daily functioning, getting a good night's sleep isn't always super easy, mostly because I tend to go to bed too late. When I don't sleep well, I feel foggy, distracted, and have trouble concentrating. I also admit that sometimes I can be kind of lazy and wish I had a better work ethic; I tend to procrastinate and put things off until the last minute or even after they're due.\n\nTo relax or when I'm feeling tense, I'll turn on a fish tank screensaver, lay down, try some deep breathing, or just watch TV. I'm pretty good at controlling my temper; I don't let anger show much and consider myself rational.",

         " Oh, I'm loose. Beep beep. Hi. So I'm going to give you this joke, and when she's done she'll let you know. Okay. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Kind of down. Why? I don't have a boyfriend. Don't have money. I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you from originally? Florida. Really? Yep. What did you do in LA? I tried to find work. How often do you go back to your hometown? About once a year. That's good. How does it compare to LA? More boring. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Not easy. Can you tell me about that? It's hard when you don't have enough money to get your own place, so I have to live with roommates. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. The scenery. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. It's too expensive to have your own place by your own. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I want to. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different places, different cultures, the buildings, the food and stuff. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I drove from Florida over here. I drove to the South. I went to Alabama. People are nicer in Louisiana. People are really nice. Then Mississippi, then Texas, then Arizona, then California. I got to see the country a little bit. Awesome. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess traveling through the country. I went to Louisiana. People are really nice in a small town called Jennings. People are always happy and fun. That's great. What did you study at school? I just went to high school. That was the basic stuff. What's your dream job? I don't know. My dream job? I'm an interior designer to the stars. Really? Yep. Why? Because they have enough money to get the furniture and I get to keep the free furniture too. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Upgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV, funny TV shows. Like what? Sometimes Big Bang Theory or sometimes a funny movie on TV. Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Where I used to live about two weeks ago, I had to move out. I moved in there and he told me that he didn't have any marijuana or marijuana plants because he didn't want to be around. He had that so I had to move out because he had a self-in-living room. Yeah, it does. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and him would handle differently. I don't know. Good question. Probably... Probably, I don't know, probably with an ex-boyfriend. We broke up. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, it's in the past. I'm over him. He was a jerk anyway. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision? Leaving home? Tell me about that. Well, I could try a better life out here in California but I miss home. Yeah, I'm sorry. Isn't it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yep. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? My roommates don't have the TV on now. It's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. I'm lazier during the day. Uh-huh. How have you been feeling lately? Frustrated. Why? I'm poor. I don't want to be. I see. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just more sad. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Wow. Um... It's been a while. It's been like, god, more over two years. Can you tell me about that? Um, I didn't have any money problems. I was doing fine. Um, yep. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? Oh, what did I do? Um, I was with my cats at home here in California and they're playing outside. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend would be nice. Um, at the beach eating at a nice restaurant. Is there anything you regret? No. Not. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't spend so much money. You'll need it in the future. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Save money. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, my bank account. How would your best friend describe you? Um, it's a nice person. You were very young, weren't you? And what? What? What are you most proud of in your life? Um, um, I'm gonna push that out now. Um, I persevere. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, I'd rather not. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh, me a few years ago. I was more like a mentor and um, taught me some things. Like what? Never complain. Be thankful for everything you have. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Um, my eyes? People say I have pretty eyes. Um, like a dress up. What are some things you like to do for fun? For fun? I like to try surfing. Go shopping. Maybe go to art galleries. That's good. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye! Bye!

         "Here's a summary of my experience with depression, in my own words:\n\n\"Right now, I'm feeling kind of down, and lately, I've been really frustrated. A big part of it is that I'm poor, and I don't want to be. I don't have a boyfriend, and money is a constant struggle. I've noticed I'm just more sad than usual.\n\nIt's been a really long time since I felt truly happy – honestly, it's been over two years. The last time I felt that way was when I didn't have any money problems and was doing fine. My financial situation impacts so much; it's hard to get my own place in LA, so I have to live with roommates, which has its own challenges, like a recent move because of a roommate's marijuana plants.\n\nWhen it comes to daily life, I can get a good night's sleep now if my roommates don't have the TV on, but if I don't sleep well, I'm tired and lazier during the day. I try to relax by watching funny TV shows like Big Bang Theory or a funny movie. Sometimes, when I'm tense, I even put on a fish tank screensaver.\n\nI've had some tough decisions, like leaving home in Florida to try for a better life out here in California, but I do miss home. It's uncomfortable for me to talk about that. My relationship with my family is something I'd rather not discuss. I've also had past relationship issues, like with an ex-boyfriend, but I'm over him now.\n\nI haven't been diagnosed with depression, but these feelings of sadness, frustration, and a lack of happiness have been present for a significant time, mostly tied to my money situation and living circumstances. I try to persevere, and I've learned from a past mentor to never complain and be thankful for everything I have, even though it's hard sometimes.\"",

         " Okay. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions and I'll answer them. And please feel free to comment below and your answers are really comforting. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling okay. I'm a little bit tired but for the most part, I'm feeling pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills, which is out in the San Fernando Valley. I was born there. And then I moved to Lomita, which is in Los Angeles County, about probably around 1993. So, I'm 23 now. So, it's about what, 19 years or so I've been living there. What are some things you really like about LA? Some things that I really like, I would have to say, you know, the beach. You know, not so much the traffic. I don't really care for that. But definitely, you know, just kind of like the nightlife. You know, just people in general. I like conversing with others. So, yeah. I see what you mean. Right. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, actually I do. I mean, I can't see your shoes. But yeah, actually I do travel a lot. I've been to places like Hawaii. I've been to the Caribbean. I've been to, let's see, you know, just different places like Arizona. I've been to Oregon, Washington. Pretty much all over, I would say. But usually mainly like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico as well. What do you enjoy about traveling? I think it's just the experience, you know. Like you can kind of experience the culture, different people, you know. Just the whole background, the scenery. It's just, you know, it's something new to experience, I would say. Something that, you know, people haven't seen before. And what's your favorite part of your trips? Well, let's see. I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago. That was back in December. It was around Christmas time, New Year's. So that was pretty fun. We went to a couple different islands. We went to, let's see, I think it was Kauai. We went to Oahu, Maui, you know, places like that. Nice. What's one thing you're most memorable seeing? You know, I would have to say that, you know, probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean. You know, just like I said before, the whole experience factor. Just seeing, you know, new, different things. Things that are unique. What did you study at school? I actually study journalism right now. In my final semester. So I'm about to graduate. A couple months. That's great. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, it's kind of funny because, you know, I started off at a, you know, a two-year community college. And so, you know, I was going into like business management. Something to do with, you know, I think basically accounting. But, you know, I kind of figured that wasn't for me. So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't, I mean, you know, I'd probably still be sitting at a desk. But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. I would almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. So. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. You know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back. Other times I kind of, it's not so much like I go into my shell, but, you know, at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't, I've never met them before. So it's one of those things that kind of, yeah, kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because, you know, I can neither be talk, very talkative or at times, you know, I can be a little bit shy. But, you know, once I get the conversation going, I'm fairly talkative. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? You know, usually I would listen to music or, you know, maybe just, you know, kind of go for a drive or, you know, hang out with my friends. You know, just something to just to kind of, you know, ease that, you know, because, you know, like I said, sometimes you get a little bit tense and you just want to relax and, you know, just do the things that you enjoy. So. How are you at controlling your temper? You know, I've actually been better with that. A couple years back, you know, there was points where like I pretty much couldn't control my temper, like whatsoever. I mean, I would just pretty much get angry. You know, the littlest things, everything would just kind of tick me off. But, you know, I've I've definitely learned to, you know, control that sort of thing. And, you know, it's made me a better person because of it. Well, let's see. I'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family, with my mother. Maybe it's I can't remember off the top of my head. But, you know, it's it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it. But, you know, eventually we make up and I apologize for it because, you know, I accept that, you know, I'm wrong in certain circumstances. You know. What's something you feel guilty about? Something that I feel guilty about? Probably, you know, not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past. You know, I mean, that is the past and, you know, I don't like to dwell on that sort of thing. But I think that's one thing that I've tried to work on. But it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing. Just being just being nice. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I ever had to make. Pretty recent. Kind of tough because I actually have a buddy. He was in the Air Force and he recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So that was really tough. And it's hard for me to talk to him because, you know, he's not really all there anymore like he used to be. So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that. But at the same time, I don't know his tendencies. He could be a little, you know, crazy. So probably like, you know, some sort of like traumatic stress disorder. Maybe when he was in the military. So I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's pretty tough, you know, because we go way back. I've been best friends with him since I was probably about five, six years old. So it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to deal with. But, you know, I try to, I don't, you know, try to keep in the back of my mind. But, you know, it's always there. I don't ever forget. So, yeah. Okay. How are your best friends friends with you? My best friend? Well, he'd probably say that, you know, I'm a pretty down to earth guy. Usually pretty honest. Sometimes brutally honest. But, you know, I try to work on that too. He'd probably say that I'm pretty funny. I like to hang out, you know, just kind of do things here and there, you know. Just normal activities like any other person. You know, go to the beach, hang out, watch movies, you know, grab a few beers, that sort of deal. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? You know, it varies. Sometimes it's easier than others. You know, if I'm really tired, you know, I'll probably have a very good sleep. I haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days because, you know, my house, there's workers on the roof. So you're putting in the new roofing. So that's kind of tough. So that always wakes me up early in the morning. So sometimes a little bit crabby. But for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep. Okay. How have you been doing lately? Lately, eh, I've been feeling pretty good, you know, because, you know, things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago for, you know, my field of journalism. So that's good. About to graduate in two months. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money. That's, you know, that's good. And, yeah, things are just going pretty well right now. I can't complain. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it's not bad. You know, like I said, it could always be worse, right? But, you know, I'm enjoying life. So that's the best part. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Did it feel down? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy? Man. You know, it was probably going back to my buddy when, you know, he was still, still had his sanity, I guess you could say. You know, he came back to visit from the Air Force. He had some leave. So, you know, we were just hanging out, you know, just kicking back, having a few beers and just talking about life. So that was nice. But I missed that, you know, so. How did you feel when that happened? I felt great, you know, because there's nothing like having a best friend. You can have conversation, you know, 24-7 about anything. You can tell anything to him in confidence. You can tell me anything in confidence. Like, it's hard to find, you know, especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now. So, yeah. Is there anything you regret? Yeah, there's probably one or two things that I regret. Well, I mean, I got a DUI about three or four years ago. Actually, it was four years ago. So that's something that I definitely regret because, you know, I look back on it and, you know, things might have been different. But at the same time, you have to accept, you know, the actions, you know, circumstances that took place. So, you know, I'm manned up and, you know, I guess I think I'm better off for it. But at the same time, you know, it's always going to be in the back of my mind, like I said. It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I usually keep it pretty generic. I tend to hang out with my friends. Either, you know, we hang out in the day, you know, do certain things like, you know, maybe grab a few beers, you know, just have casual conversation, maybe play games, watch movies, you know, just the standard stuff that people do. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Some things that I wish I could change? Probably just, you know, being nicer, like I said before. Maybe not being as lazy, have more determination. I mean, I have quite a bit of determination. I know what I want to do with my life. But I know there are times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical. So I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Well, you know, it's tough to think back. But I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is, you know, I would say probably like when I was, you know, kind of getting angry at certain people, maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have. I was trying to give more constructive criticism, but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things. And they were out of character, so. Okay. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities, I would say that I'm definitely hardworking. I'm determined. I'm very caring now, more than I used to be. Very honest. And, you know, I just, I love to talk to people. Like I like making new relationships. I like making people laugh. That's good. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something that I did recently that I really enjoyed? You know, it was probably over at my internship. I was just, you know, I wrote a story or two. And it just felt good, you know, to get those stories done. And eventually they're going to go into the paper. So I feel accomplished about that. You know, it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there. You know, it's right in your face. And you can tell yourself, you know, like I did that. So it makes me feel good. Yep. What was it about? You know, just let's see. A few different stories. Just usually things about, well, the paper's in Long Beach. So it's usually about, you know, stories or events that are taking place in Long Beach. So, yeah. What are you most proud of in life? I would say that I'm most proud of, you know, graduating high school, about to graduate college. Hopefully, you know, obviously I'm going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job, you know, in the near future. I think that's one thing that I'm most proud of. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay. I'm going to move back to the computer. I'm going to shut all the recording down. And just going to have you fill out a quick post survey about your experience. So we really value your feedback. So we really ask that you take care of your answers.",
         "Okay. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions and I'll answer them. And please feel free to comment below and your answers are really comforting. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling okay. I'm a little bit tired but for the most part, I'm feeling pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills, which is out in the San Fernando Valley. I was born there. And then I moved to Lomita, which is in Los Angeles County, about probably around 1993. So, I'm 23 now. So, it's about what, 19 years or so I've been living there. What are some things you really like about LA? Some things that I really like, I would have to say, you know, the beach. You know, not so much the traffic. I don't really care for that. But definitely, you know, just kind of like the nightlife. You know, just people in general. I like conversing with others. So, yeah. I see what you mean. Right. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, actually I do. I mean, I can't see your shoes. But yeah, actually I do travel a lot. I've been to places like Hawaii. I've been to the Caribbean. I've been to, let's see, you know, just different places like Arizona. I've been to Oregon, Washington. Pretty much all over, I would say. But usually mainly like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico as well. What do you enjoy about traveling? I think it's just the experience, you know. Like you can kind of experience the culture, different people, you know. Just the whole background, the scenery. It's just, you know, it's something new to experience, I would say. Something that, you know, people haven't seen before. And what's your favorite part of your trips? Well, let's see. I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago. That was back in December. It was around Christmas time, New Year's. So that was pretty fun. We went to a couple different islands. We went to, let's see, I think it was Kauai. We went to Oahu, Maui, you know, places like that. Nice. What's one thing you're most memorable seeing? You know, I would have to say that, you know, probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean. You know, just like I said before, the whole experience factor. Just seeing, you know, new, different things. Things that are unique. What did you study at school? I actually study journalism right now. In my final semester. So I'm about to graduate. A couple months. That's great. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, it's kind of funny because, you know, I started off at a, you know, a two-year community college. And so, you know, I was going into like business management. Something to do with, you know, I think basically accounting. But, you know, I kind of figured that wasn't for me. So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't, I mean, you know, I'd probably still be sitting at a desk. But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. I would almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. So. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. You know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back. Other times I kind of, it's not so much like I go into my shell, but, you know, at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't, I've never met them before. So it's one of those things that kind of, yeah, kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because, you know, I can neither be very talkative or at times, you know, I can be a little bit shy. But, you know, once I get the conversation going, I'm fairly talkative. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? You know, usually I would listen to music or, you know, maybe just, you know, kind of go for a drive or, you know, hang out with my friends. You know, just something to just to kind of, you know, ease that, you know, because, you know, like I said, sometimes you get a little bit tense and you just want to relax and, you know, just do the things that you enjoy. So. How are you at controlling your temper? You know, I've definitely learned to, you know, control that sort of thing. And, you know, it's made me a better person because of it. Well, let's see. I'm trying to think it was probably something with my family, with my mother. Maybe I can't remember off the top of my head. But, you know, it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it. But, you know, eventually we make up and I apologize for it because, you know, I accept that, you know, I'm wrong in certain circumstances. You know. What's something you feel guilty about? Something that I feel guilty about? Probably, you know, not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past. You know, I mean, that is the past and, you know, I don't like to dwell on that sort of thing. But I think that's one thing that I've tried to work on. But it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing. Just being nice. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I ever had to make. Pretty recent. Kind of tough because I actually have a buddy. He was in the Air Force and he recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So that was really tough. And it's hard for me to talk to him because, you know, he's not really all there anymore like he used to be. So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that. But at the same time, I don't know his tendencies. He could be a little, you know, crazy. So probably like, you know, some sort of like traumatic stress disorder. Maybe when he was in the military. So I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's just really hard to deal with. But, you know, I try to keep in the back of my mind. But, you know, it's always there. I don't ever forget. So, yeah. Okay. How are your best friends friends with you? My best friend? Well, he'd probably say that, you know, I'm a pretty down to earth guy. Usually pretty honest. Sometimes brutally honest. But, you know, I try to work on that too. He'd probably say that I'm pretty funny. I like to hang out, you know, just kind of do things here and there, you know. Just normal activities like any other person. You know, go to the beach, hang out, watch movies, you know, grab a few beers, that sort of deal. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? You know, it varies. Sometimes it's easier than others. You know, if I'm really tired, you know, I'll probably have a very good sleep. I haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days because, you know, my house, there's workers on the roof. So you're putting in the new roofing. So that's kind of tough. So that always wakes me up early in the morning. So sometimes a little bit crabby. But for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep. Okay. How have you been doing lately? Lately, eh, I've been feeling pretty good, you know, because, you know, things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago for, you know, my field of journalism. So that's good. About to graduate in two months. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money. That's, you know, that's good. And, yeah, things are just going pretty well right now. I can't complain. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it's not bad. You know, like I said, it could always be worse, right? But, you know, I'm enjoying life. So that's the best part. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Did it feel down? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy? Man. You know, it was probably going back to my buddy when, you know, he still had his sanity, I guess you could say. You know, he came back to visit from the Air Force. He had some leave. So, you know, we were just hanging out, you know, just kicking back, having a few beers and just talking about life. So that was nice. But I missed that, you know, so. How did you feel when that happened? I felt great, you know, because there's nothing like having a best friend. You can have conversation, you know, 24-7 about anything. You can tell anything to him in confidence. You can tell me anything in confidence. Like, it's hard to find, you know, especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now. So, yeah. Is there anything you regret? Yeah, there's probably one or two things that I regret. Well, I mean, I got a DUI about three or four years ago. Actually, it was four years ago. So that's something that I definitely regret because, you know, I look back on it and, you know, things might have been different. But at the same time, you have to accept, you know, the actions, you know, circumstances that took place. So, you know, I'm manned up and, you know, I guess I'm better off for it. But at the same time, you know, it's always going to be in the back of my mind, like I said. It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I usually keep it pretty generic. I tend to hang out with my friends.

         "As the interviewee, I can tell you that I haven't been diagnosed with depression, and I don't feel \"down.\" Overall, I'm feeling pretty good and enjoying life.\n\nMy current mood is quite positive. Things are looking up for me, especially with securing an internship in journalism about a month ago and being just a couple of months away from graduating. I'm also starting to make a bit more money, which is good. I really can't complain about how things are going right now; I'm enjoying life, and that's the best part. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I write stories for my internship and know they'll be published.\n\nIn terms of daily functioning, my sleep is generally pretty good. It varies, of course, but usually, I get a good night's rest. The only recent disruption has been workers on my roof, which wakes me up early and can make me a little crabby, but that's a temporary external factor. I'm quite social; I love conversing with people and making new relationships. I enjoy hanging out with my friends, whether it's grabbing beers, watching movies, or just having casual conversations.\n\nWhile I don't experience depression, I do have some emotional experiences and challenges. I feel guilty about not always being as nice to others as I could have been in the past, and it's something I regret and have tried to work on. A particularly hard situation I'm dealing with is my best friend's recent diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. It's really tough because he's not \"all there\" like he used to be, and I miss our conversations deeply. That was a time I felt truly happy – just hanging out with him, talking about life. It's hard to deal with, and it's always in the back of my mind. I also have a past regret about a DUI from four years ago, which I've had to accept and deal with.\n\nTo relax when I'm feeling tense, I usually listen to music, go for a drive, or hang out with my friends. I've also learned to control my temper, which has made me a better person. I see myself as hardworking, determined, caring, and honest, and I love to talk to people and make them laugh. While I'm determined, I sometimes get a little lackadaisical and procrastinate, which I wish I could change.\n\nSo, while I've certainly faced challenges and have things I'm working on or dealing with, I don't experience a pervasive feeling of being \"down\" or depressed.",

I've been coming here off and on for years, but officially moved here a couple years ago. I guess I've gotten as used to as I'm going to be. I don't know if that makes sense, but. Accessibility to different things as compared to Nebraska. You know, more opportunities to do different things and explore different things. Areas of interest. What are some things you don't really like about the lake? Crime. Attitude. Lack of work ethic. Lack of kindness and people. Cutthroat. Do you travel a lot? I used to. Quite a bit. What do you enjoy about traveling? A sense of freedom. The adventure. I'd love to hear about all your trips. Okay. You want me to tell you about a trip? Egypt. That's awesome. Tell me more about that. I went with my mother and some family friends. We went on an eight day cruise down the Nile. Saw all the pyramids in Giza. It was just an incredible adventure. Just to get away from everything and everybody. And close friends and just have a great time. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. How close are you to your family? Not really at all. Why? Just a history of abuse and neglect. Just not a real functional family. Dysfunctional is definitely a key word in our family. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? No, not really. I've talked about it a lot before. I'm okay with it. Okay. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. It's really hard to say. I haven't had very good, very positive role models. Ask me the question again. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. Maybe it bests my mother. She's also been a negative aspect of my life. I guess I can't really identify anybody who's been a real, real positive influence in my life. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? The trips that I've been on. What do you do to relax? I used to work out. I used to do yoga. I used to meditate. I used to exercise. I used to do a lot of things. Lately, I find it hard to relax. I don't have the same outlets that I did before. I don't pursue them as much anymore. I guess I lost my motivation or something. I'm depressed about it. I guess there it is right there. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. I'm not a temper as far as getting to the point of physicality. I don't ever that. But I stand my ground. But I can control my temper. I never lose control really. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time? Probably as recently as in the last month or so. I maybe argued with an acquaintance over... I don't know. I have to come back to that question. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Officially October of last year. I think I've been depressed longer than that. Officially October of last year. What got you to see the doctor? Actually I was being treated for other medical issues. My depression was notable to the doctors. Really? Yeah. Did you have a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? I've never been suicidal. I just often have thought that I don't have much reason to live. I used to think I had a purpose and such. I don't really have anybody in my life who I think cares enough about me. If I was even dead. I've kind of lost myself. I used to think I had enough. I used to be enough. That I was enough to have purpose in my life. I've lost quite a bit of that. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Well I'm trying to pull it together. I'm trying to get back a sense of me. I get inspired every once in a while. But overall I just don't seem to be making much progress. Do you still get up there every now and then? Yeah. Do you feel like there's a system? I wouldn't really call it therapy. I don't have a therapist per se. I have a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me. And nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues. It sucks. Uh huh. Did you say that sucks? Okay. Yeah. How have you been feeling lately? Um, overwhelmed, preoccupied. Just trying to stay alive. Stay on top of things. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or your conversation? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh, easy when I can. I don't, um, yeah, if I get a chance to fall asleep I don't have any problem with it. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm even more distracted and, um, even more lackluster I guess is the word. Sounds really hard. Whatever. How would your best friend describe you? If I had a best friend, um, I don't know. Maybe a lot of positive edges before but now just, you know, just, uh, some people say I should be proud because I'm surviving a hard time. Or some people think that I'm a loser. So, um, I don't know. Maybe a survivor. Persistent. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? Well, I used to be proud of my career and, um, kind of giving back to people. Giving back to society because I was given a lot it felt like. So I'm just proud to, uh, I don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest. I've, um, I don't know. Okay. What did you study at school? Psychology. And, um, well initially, yeah. Are you still working in that? Um, no. Not really per se although my current career involves a lot of, uh, psychology. A lot of, um, the aspects. I don't know what I'm trying to say. Um, it's a part of it but it's not the center of it. Hi, Mr. Man. What do you do now? Um, well, I guess if my career is still going I'm in nursing but, um, I've been sick lately and with depression and other health care problems I have found it necessary to apply for disability. Social Security income. And I'm starting the process of that because I'm not working. How hard is that? Mary. What's your dream job? Educating people. Um, making a difference. I mean I used to, I had my, I've had my dream jobs. I've had my dream jobs. I don't, uh, I don't know if the future will hold for, for, uh, work but, um, something I suppose working with people again. Health, uh, helping in some way. Okay. You consider yourself an introvert? Um, no but lately with depression more so at times. Uh huh. Is there anything you regret? I used to say that I never regretted anything because I would make the best decision of all things in front of me but, um, I just wish there were times then that, um, the choices that I would have were, uh, were better because some choices that I seem to have made or were made for me have, um, made my world kind of shitty. For lack of a better word, shitty. Can you give me an example of that? What? I don't understand. Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be strong. To, um, believe in myself. To remember that I've survived a lot of things and I'll survive this too. To get up off my ass and move. To, um, to have confidence. Faith. Um, I just, Murphy's Law has kicked my ass so much, you know. I just, uh, it seems like when I've tried to make my world better I just keep getting knocked down. Um, so it's almost like I'm, I don't want to give up but, um, every time I try and move forward I get knocked back. And it gets, it's exhausting. And I don't have any support system really. Nobody. Not really. What would you say of somebody who has followed you? Um, loyal. Um, hardworking. Um, dependable. Um, capable. Um, well, that seems to me. Uh, uh, intelligent. Contemplative. Um, deep. Not a superficial person. Um, yeah, I guess those are some of the... When was the last time you felt really happy? Many years ago. Can you tell me about that? Um, I used to have a lot of confidence. I used to be a pretty dynamic person. I used to be, people used to say that I was the most centered person that they knew. And I used to help people and I'm now in their shoes and I don't seem to be able to help myself. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I can't think of anything right now. I can't think of really anything right now. What are some things you like to do for fun? I don't do much anything for fun anymore. I used to, however, go to movies and entertainment venues and travel. Go to dinner with friends, do things. But lately I don't really have any pursuits. A good day, a happy day, a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong, basically. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye. Bye.",

It's really hard to say. I haven't had very good, very positive role models. Ask me the question again. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. Maybe it bests my mother. She's also been a negative aspect of my life. I guess I can't really identify anybody who's been a real positive influence in my life. Okay.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences? The trips that I've been on.\nWhat do you do to relax? I used to work out. I used to do yoga. I used to meditate. I used to exercise. I used to do a lot of things. Lately, I find it hard to relax. I don't have the same outlets that I did before. I don't pursue them as much anymore. I guess I lost my motivation or something. I'm depressed about it. I guess there it is right there.\nHow are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. I'm not a temper as far as getting to the point of physicality. I don't ever that. But I stand my ground. But I can control my temper. I never lose control really. That's good.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time? Probably as recently as in the last month or so. I maybe argued with an acquaintance over... I don't know. I have to come back to that question.\nHave you ever served in the military? No.\nHave you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression? Yes.\nHow long ago were you diagnosed? Officially October of last year. I think I've been depressed longer than that.\nWhat got you to see the doctor? Actually I was being treated for other medical issues. My depression was notable to the doctors. Really? Yeah. Did you have a problem before you found out? Yeah.\nWhat were your symptoms? I've never been suicidal. I just often have thought that I don't have much reason to live. I used to think I had a purpose and such. I don't really have anybody in my life who I think cares enough about me. If I was even dead. I've kind of lost myself. I used to think I had enough. I used to be enough. That I was enough to have purpose in my life. I've lost quite a bit of that.\nDo you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Well I'm trying to pull it together. I'm trying to get back a sense of me. I get inspired every once in a while. But overall I just don't seem to be making much progress.\nDo you still get up there every now and then? Yeah.\nDo you feel like there's a system? I wouldn't really call it therapy. I don't have a therapist per se. I have a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me. And nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues. It sucks. Uh huh. Did you say that sucks? Okay. Yeah.\nHow have you been feeling lately? Um, overwhelmed, preoccupied. Just trying to stay alive. Stay on top of things.\nHave you noticed any changes in your behavior or your conversation? No.\nHow easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh, easy when I can. I don't, um, yeah, if I get a chance to fall asleep I don't have any problem with it.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm even more distracted and, um, even more lackluster I guess is the word. Sounds really hard. Whatever.\nHow would your best friend describe you? If I had a best friend, um, I don't know. Maybe a lot of positive edges before but now just, you know, just, uh, some people say I should be proud because I'm surviving a hard time. Or some people think that I'm a loser. So, um, I don't know. Maybe a survivor. Persistent. Okay.\nWhat are you most proud of in your life? Well, I used to be proud of my career and, um, kind of giving back to people. Giving back to society because I was given a lot it felt like. So I'm just proud to, uh, I don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest. I've, um, I don't know. Okay.\nWhat did you study at school? Psychology. And, um, well initially, yeah.\nAre you still working in that? Um, no. Not really per se although my current career involves a lot of, uh, psychology. A lot of, um, the aspects. I don't know what I'm trying to say. Um, it's a part of it but it's not the center of it.\nWhat do you do now? Um, well, I guess if my career is still going I'm in nursing but, um, I've been sick lately and with depression and other health care problems I have found it necessary to apply for disability. Social Security income. And I'm starting the process of that because I'm not working.\nWhat's your dream job? Educating people. Um, making a difference. I mean I used to, I've had my dream jobs. I don't, uh, I don't know if the future will hold for, uh, work but, um, something I suppose working with people again. Health, uh, helping in some way. Okay.\nYou consider yourself an introvert? Um, no but lately with depression more so at times. Uh huh.\nIs there anything you regret? I used to say that I never regretted anything because I would make the best decision of all things in front of me but, um, I just wish there were times then that, um, the choices that I would have were better because some choices that I seem to have made or were made for me have, um, made my world kind of shitty. For lack of a better word.\nCan you give me an example of that? What? I don't understand. Let's come back to that later.\nWhat advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be strong. To, um, believe in myself. To remember that I've survived a lot of things and I'll survive this too. To get up off my ass and move. To, um, to have confidence. Faith. Um, Murphy's Law has kicked my ass so much, you know. It seems like when I've tried to make my world better I just keep getting knocked down. Um, so it's almost like I'm, I don't want to give up but, um, every time I try and move forward I get knocked back. And it gets, it's exhausting. And I don't have any support system really. Nobody. Not really.\nWhat would you say of somebody who has followed you? Um, loyal. Um, hardworking. Um, dependable. Um, capable. Um, well, that seems to me. Uh, intelligent. Contemplative. Um, deep. Not a superficial person. Um, yeah, I guess those are some of the...\nWhen was the last time you felt really happy? Many years ago.\nCan you tell me about that? Um, I used to have a lot of confidence. I used to be a pretty dynamic person. I used to be, people used to say that I was the most centered person that they knew. And I used to help people and I'm now in their shoes and I don't seem to be able to help myself. Okay.\nTell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I can't think of really anything right now.\nWhat are some things you like to do for fun? I don't do much anything for fun anymore. I used to, however, go to movies and entertainment venues and travel. Go to dinner with friends, do things. But lately I don't really have any pursuits. A good day, a happy day, a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong, basically. Okay.\nI think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye.",
         "Here's a summary of my experience with depression, in my own words:\n\nI was officially diagnosed with depression last October, though I truly believe I've been struggling with it for much longer than that. It was actually my doctors who noticed it while I was being treated for other medical issues.\n\nMy emotional state has shifted dramatically. I've never been suicidal, but I often have thought that I don't have much reason to live. I used to think I had a purpose, but now I feel like I've lost myself. I don't really have anyone in my life who I think cares enough about me, even if I were gone. I used to feel like I was enough, that I had purpose, but I've lost quite a bit of that sense of self. I find myself overwhelmed and preoccupied, just trying to stay alive and on top of things. I don't have much of a sense of pride anymore, honestly. My world just feels kind of shitty. The last time I felt truly happy was many years ago. I used to be a confident, dynamic, and centered person who helped others, and now I'm in their shoes, unable to help myself. A good day for me now is just a day without something going wrong.\n\nThis has really impacted my daily life. I used to be very active – working out, doing yoga, meditating, exercising, traveling, going to movies, and having dinner with friends. But lately, I find it hard to relax, and I don't pursue those things anymore. I've just lost my motivation. I don't do much for fun at all these days. My career in nursing has been put on hold; I've been sick lately with depression and other health problems, so I've had to apply for disability and Social Security income because I'm not working. While I can usually fall asleep easily if I get the chance, when I don't sleep well, I become even more distracted and lackluster.\n\nI'm trying to pull myself together and get back a sense of who I am, and I do get inspired every once in a while, but overall, I don't seem to be making much progress. It's exhausting because it feels like every time I try to move forward, I get knocked back down.\n\nA big part of this struggle is my lack of a support system. My family is very dysfunctional, with a history of abuse and neglect, so I'm not close to them at all. I don't have any close friends or anyone I can really talk to about my psychosocial issues. I do have a nurse practitioner who prescribes my medication, but nobody really to talk to about things. It sucks.",

         "Here's a summary of my experience with depression, in my own words:\n\nI often find myself feeling really tired. My days can be pretty low-energy; I just sit down and sleep a lot. When I think about things I need to do, I often just stop, and it's easy to forget about them. For instance, I didn't even change the battery on my car, which was a pretty bad thing to neglect. I know I have a problem with procrastination, and I really wish I could just do things before they get worse, to be prepared instead of waiting until the last minute.\n\nSometimes, like right now talking to you, I feel really happy. And I was happy recently when I went to a party and met some new friends – who isn't happy when that happens? But when asked about the last time I was happy, it's hard for me to pinpoint.\n\nA really difficult thing that happened to me was a car accident. I was on my phone, made a left turn, and a car hit me. It's been very hard because now I don't have any money since I had to pay for the repairs myself. Looking back, I also wish I had done better in school; I slacked off because I thought it was too easy.\n\nI have ideas for how I'd like to spend my ideal weekend – watching movies, reading, going to the library, discovering new places. That's very different from just sitting and sleeping. I know there are things I want to change about myself, but it's hard to articulate them right now; I feel like I'd need to write them out and plan them.",

Never mind. Okay. So now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit and ask you some questions. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. I'm going to put the doorbell right next to you. So you can ring the door once you're done. Do I see her? Yeah, you'll see her. There she is. Wow. Here's your doorbell. Thank you. Okay. Thank you.

Who's someone that's been a positive employee? My family. I'd love to hear all about it. My mother. She's a very good-hearted person. Gives me good advice. That's good. What are some things you like to do for fun? Oh, pretty close. Yeah. Family comes first. Family's number one. Yeah. What are some things you like to do for fun? Go to the gym. You know, exercise. Go to the beach. Party every once in a while. Watch basketball, football. Okay. Take trips. Go to Vegas. What's the last time you had that? Which one? Went to the gym last night. I have friends that live in Vegas, so I go there often. Enjoying the travel? I just take a trip, get out. Get away from the city for a minute. But I'm a city boy, so it can't be way too long. You know, head up the city. What do you do to relax? I don't go to the beach. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, that's been a problem over the years. What's the only thing you worry about? I don't know. I just have a little anger, I guess. Anger management problem. When was the last time you had a problem with someone? Probably only yesterday. I forget what it was about. What do you do when you're in life? I go to the gym. What are some things that will be really annoying? People. Tell me more about that. I don't know, just people. Just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes. Okay. What's your dream job? Dream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Plan Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far, the past 10 years. Then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX. I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA Airport. Nice. What's one thing that most number of people experience? What, working at the airport? I guess during the holidays there was some girl that worked there. I had a crush on her, but she turned out to be a lesbian. She's beautiful. Yeah. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. Have you been diagnosed with a disease? I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No. Why did you stop? I just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped. I'm sorry you're late. No problem. It's not your fault. Do you think it's their disease? Excuse me? Did your parents just help you? It wasn't when I was a teenager. Tell me more about that. What, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know? How have you been doing lately? I'm not going forward as fast as I want to. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is. Have you done anything to avoid it? To avoid what? Going forward? I guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would. Excuse me? Yeah, I guess. Are there? Yeah, it's like mood swings, I guess. Mood swings? Are you triggered by something? It could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know? When was the last time you had a mood swing? Oh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today. Really? How did you fool around with me? Angry. How hard is it? Yeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know? Do you think you're going to be able to control it? No. Okay. How are your best friends? My best friends? My best friends? Excuse me? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? The goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted. That's great. Thank you. Is that even your address? Yeah. Yes. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then. What made you decide to do that? To do what? To do what? Let's come back to that earlier. When was the last time you were in the house? I don't know. Today. Happy to be here. That's great. What are some things that you really put into your life? Um, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah. What would you say is something you've best followed in? My best qualities? Just that, uh, qualities. Just that I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What do you mean by qualities? What comes to your mind? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay. I think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah.

I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped. I'm sorry you're late. No problem. It's not your fault. Excuse me? Did your parents just help you? It wasn't when I was a teenager. Tell me more about that. What, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know? How have you been doing lately? I'm not going forward as fast as I want to. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is. Have you done anything to avoid it? To avoid what? Going forward? I guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would. Excuse me? Yeah, I guess. Are there? Yeah, it's like mood swings, I guess. Mood swings? Are you triggered by something? It could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know? When was the last time you had a mood swing? Oh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today. Really? How did you fool around with me? Angry. How hard is it? Yeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know? Do you think you're going to be able to control it? No. Okay. How are your best friends? My best friends? Excuse me? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? The goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted. That's great. Thank you. Is that even your address? Yeah. Yes. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then. To do what? Let's come back to that earlier. When was the last time you were in the house? I don't know. Today. Happy to be here. That's great. What are some things that you really put into your life? Um, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah. What would you say is something you've best followed in? My best qualities? Just that, uh, I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What comes to your mind? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay. I think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay, bye.",
         "Here's a summary of my experience with depression, in my own words:\n\n\"Overall, I'd say I'm doing fine today. I really love living in LA – the beach, the weather, everything. My family is number one for me, especially my mother; she's a very good-hearted person and gives me good advice. For fun, I like to go to the gym, exercise, go to the beach, party every once in a while, watch basketball and football, and take trips, like to Vegas. I was just at the gym last night, actually. Taking a trip helps me get away from the city for a minute, though I'm a city boy, so it can't be too long. Going to the beach also helps me relax.\n\nHowever, controlling my temper has been a real problem for me over the years. I guess you could say I have a little anger management problem. I had a problem with someone just yesterday, though I forget what it was about. Sometimes, people just get on my nerves; the way they are, I guess. When I'm feeling angry, I usually go to the gym to work it out.\n\nLately, I feel like I'm not going forward as fast as I want to. It's kind of hard, but it is what it is. I've accomplished some big goals, like getting my GED two years ago and finally getting my dream job at LAX, which I'm really proud of. But I just want to accomplish more, and it's taking longer than I thought it would.\n\nI also experience a lot of mood swings. They happen all the time – yesterday, maybe even today. It could be just something small, and I'll just snap and get angry. It's really hard to control my anger, especially when I'm going through a few things in my life that aren't very pleasant. Honestly, I don't think I'm going to be able to control it.\n\nMy best friends describe me as a character, very outgoing, and with a good sense of humor. They understand when I'm going through something or when I get mad about something easily, but they also know I can just laugh right after. They see me as smart, intelligent, and strong.\n\nLooking back, when I was a teenager, around 14 or 15, I was very restless and destructive. I went to a rehab or placement after doing a little bit of time, but I AWOLed, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. That's when it stopped. If I could give my younger self advice, it would be to stay in school and not join a gang, and definitely to control those anger issues I had back then.\"",

All my family's here, friends, a mixture of people, and a lot of things to do. Okay. What did you study at school? Early childhood education. Nice. Are you still working in that? No, not right now, but I would love to get back into it. Why? Love working with kids, seeing them smile. Tell me more about that. I guess it goes back to when I was a kid. I liked being happy and playful, so I guess it just transferred to my adult life. What's your dream job? Working with kids as a school teacher, or in that capacity. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is, but if it's a passion of yours, it'll always be fun. That's great. How close are you to your family? Very close. Sometimes too close. Can you give me an example of that? I have four sisters and one brother. On my mom's side, and on my dad's, I have six brothers and four sisters. We are intertwined together, so that's why I say we're too close sometimes. I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself an engineer? No. Why? I have a lot of friends that I interact with, and we're always doing different things, so that's why I say I'm not. Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? Curse. Just let it out. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? A couple days ago. My nephew didn't call me back. How did you feel in that moment? Kind of mad, because I had set aside some time to spend with him, and he just blew it off and then called me back. Yeah. That sucks. Yeah, I know. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm okay. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When my mother passed. I'm sorry. Tell me more about that. It's been about five years now to the day. It's getting better. Time makes it easier. That's good. Do you feel down? A lot, because there's a lot of things that make me think about her on a daily basis. Like what? Anything. Driving by a particular restaurant that she likes, watching different TV shows. Just anything that could trigger a memory of my mom. Yeah. When was the last time that happened? Yesterday. How do you cope with them? I think about the good times. Don't stay in that place too long. Just go ahead and think about it and move on. Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not officially, but I think I might be depressed. Tell me more about that. Well, since my mom passed, it's been kind of rough. The job situation is not stable here in California, so that has a lot to do with it as well. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is. Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Not really. I've been sort of just to myself, reserved. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Not really. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. What are you like when you do sleep well? Grumpy, irritable, fidgety, big ball of nerves. Do you travel a lot? What do you mean? Whatever comes to your mind. I guess so, yeah. I like to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting new people, different locations, scenery, different opportunities to try something new in a new location. Awesome. I'd love to hear about your trips. I just came back from Memphis about three weeks ago. Going to see family and friends. It was pretty nice. Got a chance to see something new. Change the scenery. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Wow. Stick to the plan and don't veer off to the left or right. Just go straight ahead. What made you decide to do that? Just different circumstances in life that gradually pushed me towards the left and the right. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Every day. Is there anything you regret? A few relationships, not staying in school, missing out on great opportunities with employers. How would your best friend describe you? Funny, loyal, spontaneous, life of the party. How do you know them? Grew up together in the same community, went to school together, high school friends. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Big sister Michelle, my friend Troy. I mean there's others, but those two, no matter good or bad, they're always in my corner for me. Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. When was the last time you were really happy? Yesterday. Celebrated birthday. Ah. That's great. I'd love to hear all about it. It was just a little small, intimate setting. Cooked a meal, had family and friends over, listened to music, watched movies, talked about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one unit. So it was just a nice evening. Yeah. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye bye. Was the screen like that the whole time? While I was talking.

         "Here's a summary of my experience with depression, from my perspective:\n\n\"I haven't been officially diagnosed with depression, but I strongly suspect I might be depressed. A lot of this started about five years ago, right after my mom passed away. It's been really rough since then. On a daily basis, there are so many things that make me think about her – driving by a restaurant she liked, watching certain TV shows, just anything can trigger a memory. I felt down about it just yesterday.\n\nBeyond that, the job situation here in California isn't stable, and that definitely adds to how I'm feeling. I've noticed some changes in my behavior; I've become more reserved and tend to keep to myself a lot. I don't really have disturbing thoughts, but I do feel a lot of things. Even when I get a good night's sleep, which is usually pretty easy for me, I wake up feeling grumpy, irritable, fidgety, like a big ball of nerves.\n\nWhen I do feel down because of memories of my mom, my main way of coping is to think about the good times. I try not to stay in that sad place for too long; I just think about it and then try to move on. Despite these feelings, I have a very close family – we're intertwined, sometimes too close! And I have great friends who've been with me since high school. My big sister Michelle and my friend Troy are always in my corner, no matter what. In fact, I was really happy just yesterday celebrating my birthday with family and friends, cooking, listening to music, and talking about the old days when my mom was still here and we were all one unit. It was a really nice evening.\"",

She's going to chat with me for a bit, and then when she's done she'll let you know and I'll give you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're done. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Hi, I'm Ellie. I just created a topic in the morning, and it's called, I'm not a dancer, but I'm here to learn about people and I'm glad that I'm here. I like the new fashion and the new fashion. And you can still see me in the video. Can you see me? I'm really comfortable with it. Are you going to be able to see me? Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from? I'm from Los Angeles, California. Really? What do you think you really like about LA? Wow, wonderful weather, outdoor activities all the time. What are you studying over there? Too crowded pollution. The norm. Okay. What do you study at school? I study child communications. Recently I just, I would say yes. Preschool teacher. Well, I've always worked with children ever since I was 18 years old. So I figured doing something helping someone. It doesn't pay well, but you're investing in the future. Wow. Some job that I could get paid to be outside all day. Get paid well to be outside all day. Yes. I'm kind of quiet, but I also like, I probably would say borderline. I like outside activities, but I mainly kind of do activities probably by myself. So yeah, I would say I'm an introvert slightly. Wow. Just maybe a racist or disrespectful person. I kind of shut down and reevaluate how I am as a person, how I'm coming off to other people. I can't change anyone else's personality, but I can work on my own. You're pretty good. I usually argue with people I usually walk away. I mean, an argument doesn't settle anything. Wow. So a lot of things I regret, but it's not anything that I can control. Probably the biggest regret was losing my mother. Thank you. I was extremely close to my mother. That was who I am as a person who made me as a person. Wow. 2010 years ago I would tell myself not to be so angry, so upset all the time about things I can't control. I would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself. Pretty cool. I think you should have different avenues to deal with different people. No, I have not. No, I have not. Yes. I realized I have to evaluate myself as a person, so I can't really look to anyone else to help me unless I start with myself. No, I don't. I feel like as a person, as an individual, I feel like I should be able to control things myself. I feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else. It probably is very good for other people. I've worked with that population of PTSD veterans before, so I know that it helps a lot of people, but I don't feel like it's for me. It's not difficult at all. I've always been alone or someone who tries to handle my own problems and situations. I'm a little depressed, but I think everyone has a little bit of sadness in them at some point. Day by day, day by day, I just started an exercise program, so I'm trying to look at myself for the solution. I've always known, ever since I was a child, things move me differently than other kids, so I felt like I was always different. I felt like if I was going to ever understand me as a person, then I would have to work on myself. Okay. When was the longest time you felt really happy? Today. I got to see my best friend after a long time. I mean, happiness comes and goes, but I felt happy today. That's great. How are your best friends? Wow. He would say really silly, but still, when I'm around him, I try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy. No one wants to be around a depressed person. Wow. I mean, on certain days, everything could be my best quality, but I would say I'm loyal, I'm dependable. I would just say I try to be there in the moment. I'm not a person who is really flashy or into materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded. Can someone tell me about your mother? Oh, my mother. By far, my sister. Can you tell me about that? My mom was a school teacher, which made me want to become a school teacher, and that's basically what I have been doing. My sister has been at her job for 40 years, so I've always had a stable influence in my life. What is your favorite thing about your mother? Wow. I would say just sitting on a sunny, nice day talking to my mother, I would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately. How do you feel about your mother? Wonderful. Wonderful. What is your favorite thing about your mother? I like to get out and play sports. I play four or five different sports, and I like to go for a walk. I like to ride my bike. I like to get out and be active. What's good? What are you learning from your mother? Having such a wonderful mother. I mean, I have to keep going back to that subject, because we're introduced into this life, and that's our first teacher. That's our first teacher, and it's going to be our teacher for a very long time. I'm just very thankful. I'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother. How did you get so into your mother's life? Riding my bike. Simple things. Going for a walk with my sister, exercising. When was the last time you talked to her? Just last Sunday. That's good. Okay, I think I know what I'm saying. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Well, thank you. Bye. Wow. That was too scary. That was too many glasses.",

         "Here is a summary of my experience with depression:\n\nI'd say I'm a little depressed, though I believe everyone carries a bit of sadness at some point. For a long time, I've struggled with being angry and upset about things I can't control. I often tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself. Even as a child, I felt different; things always seemed to affect me in a way that was unique compared to other kids.\n\nIn terms of my daily life, I'm generally quiet and introverted. While I enjoy outdoor activities, I mostly prefer to do them by myself. When faced with disrespect or conflict, I tend to shut down and reevaluate myself, focusing on how I come across to others, as I can't change anyone else. I usually just walk away from arguments because they don't resolve anything.\n\nSocially, I'm aware that \"no one wants to be around a depressed person,\" so when I'm with my best friend, I really try to be happy and present a positive situation for both of us. Happiness comes and goes for me, but I was genuinely happy today after seeing my best friend for the first time in a while.\n\nMy biggest regret in life was losing my mother. She was extremely close to me and truly shaped me into the person I am. Her passing was a profound loss.\n\nWhen it comes to coping, I've always been someone who tries to handle my own problems and situations. I feel strongly that I should be able to control things myself as an individual. While I know seeking help is beneficial for others, like the PTSD veterans I've worked with, I don't feel it's for me. I've always been alone in dealing with my issues. Recently, I've started an exercise program, which is a new step in looking to myself for solutions. I believe that if I'm ever going to truly understand myself, I have to do the work on my own. Simple things like riding my bike, going for a walk, or exercising help me.",

         " therapy like this instead of with a live human, it'll put all the MFTs out of business. I think it's good sometimes. I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to, if it's someone that might just go by their questions, might judge you or form opinions. If it's a virtual human being, it might be a little less biased also. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly. All right, so I'm going to start up all the recording and then I'm going to actually... I'm trying to slide on some pictures. Sorry, that's in there. Now she is... So now she's going to have a conversation with you. She's going to ask you some questions. When she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to leave you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're all finished. Thank you very much. How do I know... Is she going to say end of session or... Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. Not at all. Sorry about that. I am. I feel pretty good. I'm wide awake. I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee. And I have an easy day today. So I am just going to chat with you. Then I'm going to the gym and run some errands. So I plan on having a nice day today. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here. And I went to school away. But I'm one of the few natives that are actually in Los Angeles. Yes, I am. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. Having owned a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida. I love the weather here. I like the culture. I like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away, one can go to the desert, say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours away, you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's a great place to live. Thank you. Yeah. Well, maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also the regulations, I'm a small business owner. So all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera, some of the other Western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here in California. It really does. Most people don't understand it, but it's also, besides the high taxes, there's a big immigration problem, which being born and raised here, most people don't see that, but it's the big tax on the social service system. And that's what makes our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's, but people don't seem to want to really deal with that, but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries and I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit and I've learned a couple of languages and I surf. Like what? I'm sorry? Like what? I didn't really understand your question. When you said like what, I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa, and I enjoy that and I enjoy warm climates now, especially where you can go and relax, where there's warm water to surf. It's the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. And I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Oh, sure. One of my favorite trips of all time, whereas I used to when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span, but about 10 years ago, we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city, even though I've been there about 10 times, we got to know the city really well, which was great. Really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping, but really having been there so many times, it really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about almost a month and really get to learn the city and it was fun. Even though I grew up in LA, I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I was younger, so my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable, but I took French all through elementary, junior high and high school. So it was nice to practice my French, even though I don't remember a whole lot, and even though I started speaking French with the French, my accent is some of the greatest, so after a couple of sentences, they start talking English to me. So that was a... Did you study at school? I have a few different degrees. So I was in Naval Science major as an undergraduate, and that was fun. And I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a degree in crisis management. What made you decide to do that? I found them interesting, and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college, I went to the Naval Academy, and I went there to play sports, and I found it real interesting, being from Southern California, going to school in Maryland. And I originally wanted to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. Are you still working in that? I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products, and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather, recently father, passed away, so I sort of run a 80-year-old family business, and it's pretty interesting. I like it, having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. What's your dream job? Actually, probably my dream job? I think it's fun, because I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home, and I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. Because I do have one daughter, and didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked, but I think I would be better than, say, a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids, that I like doing it always on a part-time basis, but it seems like, boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that, having pretty much worked for most of my life. An apartment never happened, but it sounds something that, to me, would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or a villain? I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert, whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted. But I think when I feel comfortable with certain people, and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be totally confident, or people I might have known for years, either from a personal or business situation. And be more introverted. I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy generally, and I like to use the term reserved. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? What do you do to relax? Oh, wow, that's a great idea. I used to have that on one of my ... I have several computers at home, and that used to be one of my screensavers as well. I usually tend, when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, maybe going surfing or the weather is warm. I don't surf in cold weather anymore. This makes ... It gives me like a brain freeze, even though I've surfed for over 30 years. I usually find exercise helps me relax the best, or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver. I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. That's great. That was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master, though, was my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years, I think I've gotten better at them. I think that's a key thing, and I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more ... I hadn't had those skills earlier. How are you at controlling your temper? I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. I am more likely to think before I speak now, whereas, say, 20 years ago, I was more likely to act before I thought. So I might have said more things that I ... In whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation, but I've never had a violent temper, but I would have a temper where I would fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. I think a lot of that comes ... I think the key word there is maturity. When was the last time you argued with someone and had to get it out? Oh, wow. You know, I was in the 20s. Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Basically, one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different, and I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just ... I don't know if I call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married, does someone have children with them? That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep. I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I'm I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",

I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. That's great. That was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master, though, was my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years, I think I've gotten better at them. I think that's a key thing, and I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more ... I hadn't had those skills earlier. How are you at controlling your temper? I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. I am more likely to think before I speak now, whereas, say, 20 years ago, I was more likely to act before I thought. So I might have said more things that I ... In whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation, but I've never had a violent temper, but I would have a temper where I would fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. I think a lot of that comes ... I think the key word there is maturity. When was the last time you argued with someone and had to get it out? Oh, wow. You know, I was in the 20s. I haven't really had an argument with anybody in what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Basically, one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different, and I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just ... I don't know if I call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married, does someone have children with them? That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I'm I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",
         "I generally feel pretty good these days, especially in the last few months. I'm wide awake, have good energy, and enjoy my daily routine. However, like anyone, I've definitely experienced my share of \"periods of blue\" in my life. I've even thought in the past that I might have had some issues, particularly as there's a family history of it.\n\nThese \"blue periods\" were never truly debilitating; I was always able to function and manage my daily life without being completely unable to do things on my own. But I was concerned enough about them, and other life and relationship questions, to seek counseling. A significant factor in my mood is the weather. I've realized I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. When it's sunny and warm, like today, I wake up feeling incredibly happy and content, looking forward to the sun. But when the weather is dark, blue, rainy, and cold, my mood tends to dip.\n\nMy sleep is generally pretty good now, especially if I exercise regularly and don't eat too late. I find that exercise is one of my best coping strategies for relaxing and managing stress – whether it's yoga, a long walk, going to the gym, or surfing in warm water. Sometimes, just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV helps too. I've definitely gotten better at my relaxation skills as I've matured, something I wish I'd mastered earlier in life. I've also learned to control my temper much better, thinking before I speak, which is a big change from my younger days.\n\nInitially, I was quite against therapy, having grown up hearing it was ridiculous or a waste of money. But after trying it, my perspective did a complete 180. I found it incredibly useful. I didn't go because I couldn't function, but rather because I wanted an honest, unbiased opinion from a professional about life and relationships. It's good to talk things out with someone who can bring clarity to a situation without telling you what to think. I prefer someone older with more life experience, and I've found it easier to talk to women about these things. I'm not currently in therapy, as I'm taking a break from it, but I know I have someone I can go to if I need to bounce issues off them again. It's been a useful tool for me to get good ideas and gain perspective from an unbiased source, unlike talking to friends or family who know you too well.\n\nOverall, I'm feeling happier and more content lately, and I'm proud of how I've learned to manage my emotional well-being over the years.",

So once she's on that, she will let you know, she'll say goodbye, and then you're going to press this button. Okay, alright. Thank you. Okay, you're welcome. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in safe and secure environments. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to join me for the interview. Your answers are pretty confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Los Angeles. I'm born in Los Angeles. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? You have a lot of places to go, a lot of people to see, a lot of things to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Small. The environment has changed over the years. I've been around since 1952, and I was born here in Los Angeles, and I see such changes as far as environmental with the smog. And basically, that's about it. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I've been to several places in the United States, yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? Trying different types of cuisines. I like to go to museums, like the historical. I'm a historical buff. Just going somewhere different than where I've been here all my life. What do you do that you like? Let me start with, well, try Boston. I had never been to Boston before, and when I went, I was able to look at the historical of the buildings. I saw the Lake Charles and the boats and stuff. It was a good experience. There's another place I went to. I took a ferry, and my mind went blank on it. God, I can't even think of it right now. But other than that, New Orleans. I've been to New Orleans. I didn't go to the Mardi Gras. I don't like to go to Mardi Gras when they have a lot of people. I just went on off-season. I enjoyed that. I've been to Atlanta, Georgia, and I have taken a cruise. I've went to the Caribbean, and I took the Mexico cruise. My next cruise I'd like to go to is Alaska, because I want to be able to see certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet, as far as the environmental. That's great. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I'm outgoing as far as going places. I don't have a problem eating alone. I don't have a problem meeting people. I'm only shy in conversing back and forth with a stranger. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not in Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I have a favorite thing. I like to go on the Internet, and I like to do sweet states. I'm a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests. I've been very successful since I was a kid. I've won a lot of sweet states. In the evening time, I find an hour of time, and I just go online. I'm so good at it, I know just about exactly the right time to even enter. I usually try to enter before midnight when everybody else is asleep. It's been successful for me. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Getting married and having my children. How old are your kids? I have a 27-year-old son, and I have a 31-year-old son. One of them is married, the other one is not. I just not too long ago became a grandmother, so I have one grandson. My son works for the county of Los Angeles as a property conveyance examiner, and the other one is a computer engineer. I've been married for 33 years. Basically, marriage is pretty strong. That's so nice of you. Do you find it easy to be a parent? You know what? If you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them, and talk to them, and find out what's going on, and tell them that you love them. My son, I've taught them all the time when they went out the door, I love you, and even today when they'll call me and hang up, they say, Mom, I love you. You always have to give them that good feeling when they leave the door that you care. I've never had to go to any jail to get them out. They've been pretty obedient. I mean, boys will be boys, but I never had any problem as far as them getting into any serious trouble. I'm very proud of that, especially the boys. I don't know how it would have been with girls, and they'd been a little different, but the boys, I have to say, they were pretty obedient. And they respect the law. What's the best thing about being a parent? The best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves, and see what they learn basically from you. I watched my son, like I said, just a recent grandmother, and I watched him, how he handles his son. It seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son, to be responsible, to go to work every day, and he knows that, hey, I have a wife, I have a son, and it's my job to make sure that I keep a roof over their heads. So it pays off. And basically he treats her well. What was your biggest difference in your parents? My mother was more stricter on me. My parents, for some unknown reason, I guess because my sister and I, we're the girls, they weren't strict on the boys, but they were more strict on the girls. So they didn't let us go to a lot of places. And then my parents also, they weren't the type that liked to travel. And I used to look at them and say, no, I'm not going to be like them. I'm going to travel. I'm not going to just stay home. I mean, there's nothing wrong with them because they found love at home and did things at home, but they never really traveled anywhere. My mom, she was afraid of planes, for one. And I used to try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere. And she said, oh, I'm going to go here, I'm going to go there, but she never did. She died. She never did do any travel. So I made up for her. And I want to do something different, and that's to travel more and be more out there. I was more of a social butterfly. My mother was not a social butterfly. So I made up for it. Okay. How are you at controlling this? I think before I speak. And then I am a type of person also, too. I take on other people's feelings before I blurt out the wrong thing. I try to analyze the situation first, because sometimes you can open your mouth too soon, and you can put yourself in something that you will not be able to get out of. When was the last time you argued with someone about your house? It's probably something about my husband. Oh, I know what it was. It's probably some new construction that my husband is working on our house. We had a disagreement on that. Men have their own way of doing things. And I had told him not to use a certain person to work on our house. But because of the personal relationship he has with this person, he went on ahead. And now he sees all the downfalls, and he didn't listen. So I didn't say I told you so, but I guess he can tell by my facial expression that he had done wrong. And I told him, I said, look, you're losing money. And it became one problem after another. So now the construction thing is up in the air right now, because he knows he has done wrong. But he doesn't want to face the fact that, well, he knows it, but he doesn't want to really face the fact. So he says, look, it's my project. No, it's our project. So that's one of the biggest arguments that we have right now that I can think of that's recent. How do you feel about your husband? I felt that he didn't really listen to me. And he more so looked at a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways, because I told him that you need to do your research. I'm the type of person, I do my research before I jump into something. I try to dot my I's and cross my T's, but my husband, he's not like that. He's like, oh, I can get this person to do this project for X amount of money. And he's a good friend of mine's. Well, I don't care. I mean, is he licensed? He doesn't look at all that stuff. He just jumps into it, which cost him some extra money, unnecessary money that he spent. And I mean, it was a lot of money. And so I was really very upset yesterday, and I was very upset about it, because it was just wasted money that we could have saved, because we wind up doing the same thing all over again. And it didn't make any sense. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. I retired early. I was very fortunate to retire at age 50. I retired in 2002. I was working for the State of California as a disability analyst. And what happened was, I was able to, the reason why I was able to retire so early, because I've been working since I was 18, and I had like 31 and a half years of service. And what was so nice about it that I only needed to invest in like 10 years in my health insurance. So I was able to get full health insurance. But the only thing about it when you retire, I was with CalPERS. And I don't know if you're familiar with CalPERS, but we have an excellent retirement system. And since I had been working with them so long, I didn't get the full percentage. I should have stayed until I was 55, but I got out at 50, and I didn't get the full amount, but that's okay. I found myself going back doing a little part-time job because of the economical reason, and then I have one-itis. So I think that was the kind of mistake I did. I should have kind of waited until I was 55 and 50. But I look at it now as far as the health insurance. I really benefited because of the rising costs of the health insurance have went up, and I pay very little money. So I think that over negates the money that I receive. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see, the hardest. It's probably when my mom died because I'm not used to anybody dying. My mother died in 1999 of non-hospital lymphoma, and putting her funeral together. My brother and sister, we were never faced with anybody dying or putting a funeral together. And I was responsible because I am the eldest. I was kind of left out there trying to find her insurance policy because I had asked her to make sure she put everything in order, and she never got to it. So the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things. I myself, I keep my things organized, but for some unknown reason, she didn't have hers organized. I think that was the hardest, knowing how much I had to pay because I had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. And unfortunately, my mom, this is interesting, she had one little small barrel insurance, but she had a million dollars of accident insurance. And she didn't die of course of accident, she had a medical condition. So that was something. So we had to pay for the whole, just about everything. Yeah, it was, it was, but now I can handle it. This will sound weird, but since that, I've learned from that. So I have made it available for my children that my husband and I, we got together and we want to get our insurance policy, not insurance policy, but what do you call it? What do you call the barrel insurance? We had that and it just, we've had it for many, many years. So it's almost paid, but it's been 10 years. They'll pay for everything, the plot and everything. And another thing that I did, I even written my own obituary. I know that sounds weird. So my son make one phone call, that's it. I don't want them to go through what I went through. And my husband agreed. That's the one thing we did agree on. And he said he don't want anybody to have any problem. People coming in and telling them what to do. It's already written. We did a living trust. I mean, it's nothing they can do but make one phone call. And that's it. I have no problem sleeping. I sleep very well. Pretty good. I've been a little tired, but that's only because of physical condition. I have, I found out I have vitamin B deficiency and vitamin D deficiency. So it's more physical, but not mental. How do you help with that? Exercise, walk, walking more so. Have you ever seen a student say that they're doing that? No, not really. No. No. I'm basically happy all the time. I'm more so I'm making other people happy. I get more phone calls of people who want inspiration about things. When they have projects they're working on and I try to encourage them. And it makes me feel good when they hang up and say, you know, hey, I really appreciate your input. Thanks. And then they all follow up on them and see how they're doing. Resource person. I've been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends. Because I'm the type of person I research everything I get into just about. I just don't dive into any situation. I try to look up information. Some I know we have the technology here that you can get everything on the Internet, but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place. I mean, I did the map Google, but also I love the Thomas Brothers. I never going to give up my Thomas Brothers map. Yellow Pages. You'd be surprised I don't give up my yellow pages. So there's certain little things that I don't really let go. I know we have technology, but sometimes you know, you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology you have it right at your finger. But you can find things. And they say I'm more of a resource person. Most people come to me just the look of things. And I get that that spunk about it because I like to look for stuff and find it. That gives me satisfaction. I wish I can stuff going up and down on my weight. I'll lose weight. I'll go on this big diet before the summertime. And then by Christmas time, I have what they call yo-yo weight problem. And if I can stop binging and making food, my friend, I think that's just a nervous disorder. I like to eat. But also I don't like to be overweight either because I have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and I can't get them on right now. So I know myself. I'm going to go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so I can get in those nice clothes. So it's mostly not happy with my weight. And that's it. Yeah. Is there anything you regret? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. Is there anything you regret? No, not really. I regret that I can't stay skinny. I can lose the weight, but I regret not being able to keep it and fall back on, putting the weight back on. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 12 years ago? Um, let's see, what am I going to say, 10 or 20 years ago? Hmm. I would have saved a little bit more money before I retired. And basically putting away more money before I retire instead of retiring too early. What's the proudest thing in your life? What's the proudest thing in my life? Meeting a lot of people that came in my life. I've got good friends. I still have 15 of the best friends that I went to elementary school. And very rarely you can find anybody that can walk around and say they have the same 15 group of friends. We were in sorority together, went to college together, lived in the same neighborhood. And matter of fact, we just had, all of us had our 60th birthday. And our high school group, we put together a 60-year birthday reunion. And here are all 15 of us with the exception of one. We're all alive and healthy. And we keep in contact. So I think it's basically keeping the same friends. I think we're going to probably outlive each other. Okay. I think that's all. I think that's all. Okay. I appreciate your thoughts. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Okay. Okay. Alrighty. That's kind of weird. What, a girlfriend?",
         "Oh gosh, she's going to fix the hair up there. Now I can really see. Okay, so now I'm going to start this recording. Great. Okay. So once she's on that, she will let you know, she'll say goodbye, and then you're going to press this button. Okay, alright. Thank you. Okay, you're welcome. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in safe and secure environments. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to join me for the interview. Your answers are pretty confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Los Angeles. I'm born in Los Angeles. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? You have a lot of places to go, a lot of people to see, a lot of things to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Small. The environment has changed over the years. I've been around since 1952, and I was born here in Los Angeles, and I see such changes as far as environmental with the smog. And basically, that's about it. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I've been to several places in the United States, yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? Trying different types of cuisines. I like to go to museums, like the historical. I'm a historical buff. Just going somewhere different than where I've been here all my life. Let me start with, well, try Boston. I had never been to Boston before, and when I went, I was able to look at the historical of the buildings. I saw the Lake Charles and the boats and stuff. It was a good experience. There's another place I went to. I took a ferry, and my mind went blank on it. God, I can't even think of it right now. But other than that, New Orleans. I've been to New Orleans. I didn't go to the Mardi Gras. I don't like to go to Mardi Gras when they have a lot of people. I just went on off-season. I enjoyed that. I've been to Atlanta, Georgia, and I have taken a cruise. I've went to the Caribbean, and I took the Mexico cruise. My next cruise I'd like to go to is Alaska, because I want to be able to see certain areas that we haven't destroyed yet, as far as the environmental. That's great. Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I'm outgoing as far as going places. I don't have a problem eating alone. I don't have a problem meeting people. I'm only shy in conversing back and forth with a stranger. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not in Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I have a favorite thing. I like to go on the Internet, and I like to do sweet states. I'm a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests. I've been very successful since I was a kid. I've won a lot of sweet states. In the evening time, I find an hour of time, and I just go online. I'm so good at it, I know just about exactly the right time to even enter. I usually try to enter before midnight when everybody else is asleep. It's been successful for me. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Getting married and having my children. How old are your kids? I have a 27-year-old son, and I have a 31-year-old son. One of them is married, the other one is not. I just not too long ago became a grandmother, so I have one grandson. My son works for the county of Los Angeles as a property conveyance examiner, and the other one is a computer engineer. I've been married for 33 years. Basically, marriage is pretty strong. That's so nice of you. Do you find it easy to be a parent? You know what? If you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them, and talk to them, and find out what's going on, and tell them that you love them. My son, I've taught them all the time when they went out the door, I love you, and even today when they'll call me and hang up, they say, Mom, I love you. You always have to give them that good feeling when they leave the door that you care. I've never had to go to any jail to get them out. They've been pretty obedient. I mean, boys will be boys, but I never had any problem as far as them getting into any serious trouble. I'm very proud of that, especially the boys. I don't know how it would have been with girls, and they'd been a little different, but the boys, I have to say, they were pretty obedient. And they respect the law. What's the best thing about being a parent? The best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves, and see what they learn basically from you. I watched my son, like I said, just a recent grandmother, and I watched him, how he handles his son. It seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son, to be responsible, to go to work every day, and he knows that, hey, I have a wife, I have a son, and it's my job to make sure that I keep a roof over their heads. So it pays off. And basically he treats her well. What was your biggest difference in your parents? My mother was more stricter on me. My parents, for some unknown reason, I guess because my sister and I, we're the girls, they weren't strict on the boys, but they were more strict on the girls. So they didn't let us go to a lot of places. And then my parents also, they weren't the type that liked to travel. And I used to look at them and say, no, I'm not going to be like them. I'm going to travel. I'm not going to just stay home. I mean, there's nothing wrong with them because they found love at home and did things at home, but they never really traveled anywhere. My mom, she was afraid of planes, for one. And I used to try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere. And she said, oh, I'm going to go here, I'm going to go there, but she never did. She died. She never did do any travel. So I made up for her. And I want to do something different, and that's to travel more and be more out there. I was more of a social butterfly. My mother was not a social butterfly. So I made up for it. Okay. How are you at controlling this? I think before I speak. And then I am a type of person also, too. I take on other people's feelings before I blurt out the wrong thing. I try to analyze the situation first, because sometimes you can open your mouth too soon, and you can put yourself in something that you will not be able to get out of. When was the last time you argued with someone about your house? It's probably something about my husband. Oh, I know what it was. It's probably some new construction that my husband is working on our house. We had a disagreement on that. Men have their own way of doing things. And I had told him not to use a certain person to work on our house. But because of the personal relationship he has with this person, he went on ahead. And now he sees all the downfalls, and he didn't listen. So I didn't say I told you so, but I guess he can tell by my facial expression that he had done wrong. And I told him, I said, look, you're losing money. And it became one problem after another. So now the construction thing is up in the air right now, because he knows he has done wrong. But he doesn't want to face the fact that, well, he knows it, but he doesn't want to really face the fact. So he says, look, it's my project. No, it's our project. So that's one of the biggest arguments that we have right now that I can think of that's recent. How do you feel about your husband? I felt that he didn't really listen to me. And he more so looked at a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways, because I told him that you need to do your research. I'm the type of person, I do my research before I jump into something. I try to dot my I's and cross my T's, but my husband, he's not like that. He's like, oh, I can get this person to do this project for X amount of money. And he's a good friend of mine's. Well, I don't care. I mean, is he licensed? He doesn't look at all that stuff. He just jumps into it, which cost him some extra money, unnecessary money that he spent. And I mean, it was a lot of money. And so I was really very upset yesterday, and I was very upset about it, because it was just wasted money that we could have saved, because we wind up doing the same thing all over again. And it didn't make any sense. Tell me about a situation that you wish you had handled differently. I retired early. I was very fortunate to retire at age 50. I retired in 2002. I was working for the State of California as a disability analyst. And what happened was, I was able to, the reason why I was able to retire so early, because I've been working since I was 18, and I had like 31 and a half years of service. And what was so nice about it that I only needed to invest in like 10 years in my health insurance. So I was able to get full health insurance. But the only thing about it when you retire, I was with CalPERS. And I don't know if you're familiar with CalPERS, but we have an excellent retirement system. And since I had been working with them so long, I didn't get the full percentage. I should have stayed until I was 55, but I got out at 50, and I didn't get the full amount, but that's okay. I found myself going back doing a little part-time job because of the economical reason, and then I have one-itis. So I think that was the kind of mistake I did. I should have kind of waited until I was 55. But I look at it now as far as the health insurance. I really benefited because of the rising costs of the health insurance have went up, and I pay very little money. So I think that over negates the money that I receive. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see, the hardest. It's probably when my mom died because I'm not used to anybody dying. My mother died in 1999 of non-hospital lymphoma, and putting her funeral together. My brother and sister, we were never faced with anybody dying or putting a funeral together. And I was responsible because I am the eldest. I was kind of left out there trying to find her insurance policy because I had asked her to make sure she put everything in order, and she never got to it. So the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things. I myself, I keep my things organized, but for some unknown reason, she didn't have hers organized. I think that was the hardest, knowing how much I had to pay because I had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff. And unfortunately, my mom, this is interesting, she had one little small barrel insurance, but she had a million dollars of accident insurance. And she didn't die of course of accident, she had a medical condition. So that was something. So we had to pay for the whole, just about everything. Yeah, it was, but now I can handle it. This will sound weird, but since that, I've learned from that. So I have made it available for my children that my husband and I, we got together and we want to get our insurance policy, not insurance policy, but what do you call it? What do you call the barrel insurance? We had that and it just, we've had it for many, many years. So it's almost paid, but it's been 10 years. They'll pay for everything, the plot and everything. And another thing that I did, I even written my own obituary. I know that sounds weird. So my son make one phone call, that's it. I don't want them to go through what I went through. And my husband agreed. That's the one thing we did agree on. And he said he don't want anybody to have any problem. People coming in and telling them what to do. It's already written. We did a living trust. I mean, it's nothing they can do but make one phone call. And that's it. I have no problem sleeping. I sleep very well. Pretty good. I've been a little tired, but that's only because of physical condition. I found out I have vitamin B deficiency and vitamin D deficiency. So it's more physical, but not mental. How do you help with that? Exercise, walk, walking more so. Have you ever seen a student say that they're doing that? No, not really. I'm basically happy all the time. I'm more so I'm making other people happy. I get more phone calls of people who want inspiration about things. When they have projects they're working on and I try to encourage them. And it makes me feel good when they hang up and say, you know, hey, I really appreciate your input. Thanks. And then they all follow up on them and see how they're doing. Resource person. I've been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends. Because I'm the type of person I research everything I get into just about. I just don't dive into any situation. I try to look up information. Some I know we have the technology here that you can get everything on the Internet, but also go back to the old school like even finding this place. I mean, I did the map Google, but also I love the Thomas Brothers. I never going to give up my Thomas Brothers map. Yellow Pages. You'd be surprised I don't give up my yellow pages. So there's certain little things that I don't really let go. I know we have technology, but sometimes you know, you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology you have it right at your finger. But you can find things. And they say I'm more of a resource person. Most people come to me just the look of things. And I get that that spunk about it because I like to look for stuff and find it. That gives me satisfaction. I wish I can stuff going up and down on my weight. I'll lose weight. I'll go on this big diet before the summertime. And then by Christmas time, I have what they call yo-yo weight problem. And if I can stop binging and making food, my friend, I think that's just a nervous disorder. I like to eat. But also I don't like to be overweight either because I have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and I can't get them on right now. So I know myself. I'm going to go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so I can get in those nice clothes. So it's mostly not happy with my weight. And that's it. Yeah. Is there anything you regret? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you. Is there anything you regret? No, not really. I regret that I can't stay skinny. I can lose the weight, but I regret not being able to keep it and fall back on, putting the weight back on. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 12 years ago? Um, let's see, 10 or 20 years ago? Hmm. I would have saved a little bit more money before I retired. And basically putting away more money before I retire instead of retiring too early. What's the proudest thing in your life? What's the proudest thing in my life? Meeting a lot of people that came in my life. I've got good friends. I still have 15 of the best friends that I went to elementary school.

I appreciate your thoughts. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Okay. Alrighty.",
         "I'm generally doing well, and I'd say I'm a happy person. When asked how I'm doing, I usually say I'm fine, and I truly believe I'm basically happy all the time. I find a lot of satisfaction in making other people happy and being a \"resource person\" for my friends and even my former supervisors, offering encouragement and input on their projects. It makes me feel good when they appreciate my advice and follow up on it.\n\nRegarding my emotional state, I don't really experience mental health struggles. Any tiredness I've felt has been due to physical conditions, like vitamin B and D deficiencies, not my mental state. I have no problem sleeping; I sleep very well.\n\nMy daily functioning is pretty good. I'm outgoing in terms of going places, eating alone, and meeting people, though I can be a bit shy when conversing back and forth with strangers. I enjoy traveling, exploring different cuisines, and visiting historical museums. To relax, I love going online and entering sweepstakes; I've been quite successful at winning contests since I was a kid.\n\nThe main area where I express some dissatisfaction is with my weight. I have what I call a \"yo-yo weight problem,\" where I lose weight for summer and then put it back on by Christmas. I tend to binge eat, which I think is a \"nervous disorder,\" and I wish I could stop it so I could fit into my beautiful clothes. This is one of my main regrets, not being able to keep the weight off.\n\nI've also had to navigate some difficult situations, like the passing of my mother in 1999. That was the hardest decision I've ever had to make, putting her funeral together and dealing with her unorganized affairs. It was a challenging time, as my siblings and I had never faced death before. However, I learned from that experience and have since organized my own affairs, including writing my own obituary and setting up a living trust, so my children won't have to go through what I did.\n\nOverall, I feel very fortunate. I've been married for 33 years, and my marriage is strong. I'm incredibly proud of my two sons, who are responsible and successful, and I recently became a grandmother, which is wonderful. I also cherish my long-standing friendships; I still have 15 of my best friends from elementary school, and we're all still in contact and healthy.",

         " Okay, awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. You know, how about yourself? I'm great. Awesome. Where are you from? I'm from Guatemala. My parents migrated here to the United States when I was like three years old. So, yeah. Really? Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been there, actually. I haven't been back to my hometown since forever. Why? Just, you know, I have all my family here, my mom, my dad, my cousins, aunts, uncles. So, practically, I have my life here. So, I probably, I mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know, just my curiosity hasn't, you know, gone there, I guess. Okay. What's your favorite part about Guatemala? I love the people. Everyone's nice. I love the diversity, you know. There's different types of people and imaginations out there. You know, everything's just great. You know, everyone's different, you know. No one's like the same, at least to some aspects. And I love the scenery. I love, you know, the mountains. They're beautiful, you know, great for hikes, you know, taking out, you know, the dog, the family, you know. It's nice. It's pretty active. Yeah. What is your favorite smog? The smog. I don't like the smog. It's just, you know, if you go out further out, you know, you could tell by the air, you know, or, you know, everything's clear. The sky's bluer. But other than that, like, you know, in traffic, nobody likes traffic, I think. Yeah. But yeah, that's, you know, pretty much LA is pretty nice, you know. I like it. That's good. What did you study at school? Well, I was studying just basic, you know. I'm not sure exactly what I want to be. So it's just kind of, you know, here and there, just jumping through hoops and stuff. So not really set yet. It's still trying to find my interest, I suppose. What's your dream job? My dream job. That's a good one. I love working with children. So I would say probably a child psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what's going on in the young minds and, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, make children, you know, or help, you know, help them, you know, grow up in a positive way, I suppose, instead of, like, going the wrong track. Yeah. I just, you know, help children. Is it just so high-five or up-going? It depends. It depends on the situation I'm in. Sometimes, you know, I could be, like, super outgoing and just, like, you know, and sometimes I could just, I could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention, you know, if I'm, like, in class or whatever. I don't really, like, and there's everyone talking. I just, I prefer just to stay away from that, you know, because I need something else to concentrate on something else. You know, there's, like, a moment in time for everything, I suppose. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm being there, I turn on the first page of the screen favorite. Hey, I know it's not blind, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to kick my feet up on the couch and, like, read a good book, you know, just get my mind going to another, you know, galaxy or universe or situation, you know. It's pretty fun, you know, just, you know, reading and then just having yourself relaxed and, you know, feeling good. That's great. Yeah, it is. It's just fun. I love reading. How are you at controlling your own mood? I'm okay with it. I'm not, like, the best, you know, temper-controlling person there is out there. You know, I try my best and I guess that's all I could do until I keep doing better eventually. But I'm not, like, the best. I mean, I sometimes I do have my outbursts, you know. But, you know, I guess that's everyone. I'm not sure. When was the last time you argued with him? Ah, huh. That's a good question. That's a good question. I don't remember. Let's see. Honestly, I can't recall. Maybe. My goodness. I don't know. Sometimes I'm very passive. That's just like let things go because, I mean, what's the point of making a big deal out of things? You know, so, huh, I don't know. I honestly I can't tell you that at this moment. Why don't we talk about that later? Sure. Yeah, probably come back to it. What's something with your relationship? Um, huh. Well, I guess when I was younger, I, you know, could have been better older sister and I wasn't. And that makes me feel guilty for sure. You know, I could have been a better sister. Better role model. But I'm trying my best now, so I'm trying to make things better. And it's working. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your ex-wife. Oh, I guess, huh. Hmm. I don't know. I mean, I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life. So if I erase something, then it's just there's something of me in my present self or, you know, that would change. And I don't know. I'm pretty OK with the person that I am now. I mean, you know, I don't think I would change an event. You know, I'm OK with what, you know, ups and downs and good and bad that has happened. OK. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. But I am kind of like an explorer, I guess. I love to explore, like, even the smallest things. Like if I go hiking, I go off trail and, you know, just find my way up to the top, you know, somehow some way and just make it, you know, traveling. I would love to do that. But I don't know, just, you know, always circumstances in my life that doesn't, you know, always something, you know, I get married, children, you know, and all this. So it's kind of like, you know, it would be nice, I guess, you know, it would be nice. You know, I love camping. That's kind of like, you know, taking a few days trips out there, camping and fishing. Yeah. It was this summer, you know, me and my husband went camping and it was really nice. It was just me and him, you know, and it was like no one. And it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake. And, you know, it was it was really nice. It was just, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was. It was. It was really fun. It was like I would love to do it again, you know, right now. It would be great, you know, just going out there. It's just I love that venture of things and the nature and just life and, you know, overall. Yeah. It's easy, but lately I haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because I don't know, just, you know, just I'm laying there and I'm just like trying to go to sleep and I'm just like, oh, but eventually I do. You know, I just I probably like need to position myself in a different side of the bed. Like sometimes I'm in the headboard and I'm like, oh, I got to go to the other side. And once I position myself, then I just like go to sleep, you know, but it just I got to find the right position for me. Yeah. Um, I'm tired. I get tired throughout the day, you know, but I kind of try to shake it off, you know, and just kind of like feel like it's a new day, you know, and just try to make the day that I have as great as possible, you know, and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of, you know. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, it's OK. I try to make it the best, I guess. If not, then I just go to sleep throughout the day, which sucks. But yeah. No. No. I've been feeling good. Yeah, I've been feeling really good. You know, a lot of things in my life have, you know, I'm having a really good year so far. So I'm very happy with that. You know, everything's, you know, going good, you know. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. It is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible. But that's just nature. My immune system has to work harder. Super happy was when the doctor told me I was pregnant. You know, I was really, really happy about that. And I was just like, oh, you know, that was really, really good. You know, very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby. And, oh, that's very overwhelming. And it's scary at the same time. I've never really like, you know, but yeah, I'm very happy. Yeah. I don't know. I guess just me myself, you know, like, you know, I could, you know, just be myself and that's it. You know, just I can't really, you know, say I have a specific thing, I guess. I mean, it depends on the person that meets me to tell me. I can't really tell myself like, oh, I'm this, I'm that, you know, just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to, you know, tell me or, you know, compliment me or whatnot. Yeah. Oh, nothing, I think. Um, like I said, I'm happy with the person I am right now. And, you know, my flaws or whatever, you know, I might have, I don't know, whatever flaw people see in me and it's OK. You know, I'm OK with it. Whatever it just I'm not going to I can't change myself for the likings of other people. I have only one body and one life. So, yeah, yeah, that's it. Ah, just my childhood with my sisters and my family. But, you know, it's, you know, you learn from that, you learn from the past and you kind of feel like, hey, you know, maybe I should be a better role model, you know, for my children. And so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve. Um, just smile and be happy, you know, and whatever hard things happen, you know, you're going to get through them eventually, you know, the only thing you can't do is to be happy. You can't, I don't know, you can't, you know, go back on his death. You know, you could, you know, a heartbreak or whatever. But, you know, as long as I'm alive, I still got to keep going. Yeah. I don't know. That's pretty, huh, most proud of. I guess that I'm trying my best to be the best I could be. And that's pretty powerful. You know, I'm, you know, I try to be, you know, a better person each day and try to like, you know, improve myself every day as much as I can. You know, that would probably be something I could be super proud of, you know, as much as I can. Very hard. I'm not going to lie. It is really hard, you know, because I can't say, you know, it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good. You know, and, you know, it's always challenges and everything that goes, you know, in your life. But, you know, it's just it's sometimes, you know, hard, you know, and sometimes it comes easy, you know, after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try, you know. So, yeah. You know, loving, friendly, outgoing, you know, adventures, I guess. I don't know. That's what they say. Just, you know, that's them. Like, you know, but that's what at least what I try to be. You know, at least I try to give the best foot forward always as much as possible. You know, even sometimes even if I'm having a rough day, I'm just like, oh, you know, you know, I just I don't want to be bad. You know, I just I don't want to take it out on anyone or anything, you know. Yeah. Yeah. How do you spend your ideal weekend? My ideal weekend. Usually I like going to the park. I like sitting down in like a tree under a tree, actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there, have my dog and like read a book. And, you know, sometimes if I don't have my dog, like there's little scrolls running around and they like me to feed them. So that's pretty neat, you know, just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise, I guess, because there's not silence. You know, the wind and the cars and, you know, it's just it's really neat. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.",
         "Okay, awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. You know, how about yourself? I'm great. Awesome. Where are you from? I'm from Guatemala. My parents migrated here to the United States when I was like three years old. So, yeah. Really? Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been there, actually. I haven't been back to my hometown since forever. Why? Just, you know, I have all my family here, my mom, my dad, my cousins, aunts, uncles. So, practically, I have my life here. So, I probably, I mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know, just my curiosity hasn't, you know, gone there, I guess. Okay. What's your favorite part about Guatemala? I love the people. Everyone's nice. I love the diversity, you know. There's different types of people and imaginations out there. You know, everything's just great. You know, everyone's different, you know. No one's like the same, at least to some aspects. And I love the scenery. I love, you know, the mountains. They're beautiful, you know, great for hikes, you know, taking out, you know, the dog, the family, you know. It's nice. It's pretty active. Yeah. What is your favorite smog? The smog. I don't like the smog. It's just, you know, if you go out further out, you know, you could tell by the air, you know, or, you know, everything's clear. The sky's bluer. But other than that, like, you know, in traffic, nobody likes traffic, I think. Yeah. But yeah, that's, you know, pretty much LA is pretty nice, you know. I like it. That's good. What did you study at school? Well, I was studying just basic, you know. I'm not sure exactly what I want to be. So it's just kind of, you know, here and there, just jumping through hoops and stuff. So not really set yet. It's still trying to find my interest, I suppose. What's your dream job? My dream job. That's a good one. I love working with children. So I would say probably a child psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what's going on in the young minds and, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, make children, or help them grow up in a positive way, I suppose, instead of, like, going the wrong track. Yeah. I just, you know, help children. Is it just so high-five or up-going? It depends. It depends on the situation I'm in. Sometimes, you know, I could be, like, super outgoing and just, like, you know, and sometimes I could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention, you know, if I'm, like, in class or whatever. I don't really, like, and there's everyone talking. I prefer to stay away from that, you know, because I need something else to concentrate on something else. You know, there's, like, a moment in time for everything, I suppose. Yeah. What do you do to relax? I like to kick my feet up on the couch and, like, read a good book, you know, just get my mind going to another, you know, galaxy or universe or situation, you know. It's pretty fun, you know, just, you know, reading and then just having yourself relaxed and, you know, feeling good. That's great. Yeah, it is. It's just fun. I love reading. How are you at controlling your own mood? I'm okay with it. I'm not, like, the best, you know, temper-controlling person there is out there. You know, I try my best and I guess that's all I could do until I keep doing better eventually. But I'm not, like, the best. I mean, I sometimes I do have my outbursts, you know. But, you know, I guess that's everyone. I'm not sure. When was the last time you argued with him? Ah, huh. That's a good question. I don't remember. Let's see. Honestly, I can't recall. Maybe. My goodness. I don't know. Sometimes I'm very passive. That's just like let things go because, I mean, what's the point of making a big deal out of things? You know, so, huh, I don't know. I honestly I can't tell you that at this moment. Why don't we talk about that later? Sure. Yeah, probably come back to it. What's something with your relationship? Um, huh. Well, I guess when I was younger, I, you know, could have been better older sister and I wasn't. And that makes me feel guilty for sure. You know, I could have been a better sister. Better role model. But I'm trying my best now, so I'm trying to make things better. And it's working. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your ex-wife. Oh, I guess, huh. Hmm. I don't know. I mean, I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life. So if I erase something, then it's just there's something of me in my present self or, you know, that would change. And I don't know. I'm pretty OK with the person that I am now. I mean, you know, I don't think I would change an event. You know, I'm OK with what, you know, ups and downs and good and bad that has happened. OK. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. But I am kind of like an explorer, I guess. I love to explore, like, even the smallest things. Like if I go hiking, I go off trail and, you know, just find my way up to the top, you know, somehow some way and just make it, you know, traveling. I would love to do that. But I don't know, just, you know, always circumstances in my life that doesn't, you know, always something, you know, I get married, children, you know, and all this. So it's kind of like, you know, it would be nice, I guess. It would be nice. You know, I love camping. That's kind of like, you know, taking a few days trips out there, camping and fishing. Yeah. It was this summer, you know, me and my husband went camping and it was really nice. It was just me and him, you know, and it was like no one. And it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake. And, you know, it was really nice. It was just, yeah. Yeah, it was really fun. It was like I would love to do it again, you know, right now. It would be great, you know, just going out there. It's just I love that venture of things and the nature and just life and, you know, overall. Yeah. Um, I'm tired. I get tired throughout the day, you know, but I kind of try to shake it off, you know, and just kind of like feel like it's a new day, you know, and just try to make the day that I have as great as possible, you know, and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of, you know. So, yeah, it's just, you know, it's OK. I try to make it the best, I guess. If not, then I just go to sleep throughout the day, which sucks. But yeah. No. I've been feeling good. Yeah, I've been feeling really good. You know, a lot of things in my life have, you know, I'm having a really good year so far. So I'm very happy with that. You know, everything's, you know, going good, you know. Yeah, it is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible. But that's just nature. My immune system has to work harder. Super happy was when the doctor told me I was pregnant. You know, I was really happy about that. And I was just like, oh, you know, that was really good. You know, very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby. And, oh, that's very overwhelming. And it's scary at the same time. I've never really like, you know, but yeah, I'm very happy. Yeah. I don't know. I guess just me myself, you know, like, you know, I could, you know, just be myself and that's it. You know, just I can't really, you know, say I have a specific thing, I guess. I mean, it depends on the person that meets me to tell me. I can't really tell myself like, oh, I'm this, I'm that, you know, just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to, you know, tell me or, you know, compliment me or whatnot. Yeah. Oh, nothing, I think. Um, like I said, I'm happy with the person I am right now. And, you know, my flaws or whatever, you know, I might have, I don't know, whatever flaw people see in me and it's OK. You know, I'm OK with it. Whatever it just I'm not going to I can't change myself for the likings of other people. I have only one body and one life. So, yeah, that's it. Ah, just my childhood with my sisters and my family. But, you know, it's, you know, you learn from that, from the past and you kind of feel like, hey, you know, maybe I should be a better role model, you know, for my children. And so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve. Um, just smile and be happy, you know, and whatever hard things happen, you know, you're going to get through them eventually, you know, the only thing you can't do is to be happy. You can't, I don't know, go back on his death. You know, you could, you know, a heartbreak or whatever. But, you know, as long as I'm alive, I still got to keep going. Yeah. I don't know. That's pretty, huh, most proud of. I guess that I'm trying my best to be the best I could be. And that's pretty powerful. You know, I'm, you know, I try to be, you know, a better person each day and try to like, you know, improve myself every day as much as I can. You know, that would probably be something I could be super proud of. Very hard. I'm not going to lie.

         "When it comes to my mental health, I can honestly say I've been feeling really good lately. In fact, I'm having a really good year so far, and I'm very happy with how everything is going, especially with my pregnancy, which has brought me a lot of joy and excitement.\n\nWhile my overall mood is positive, I do have some experiences that can be challenging. For example, I often get tired throughout the day. Sometimes I can shake it off and push through, trying to make the day as great as possible. But if I can't, I might end up taking a nap during the day, which \"sucks\" because I prefer to make the most of my time. I also acknowledge that I'm not always the best at controlling my mood or temper, and I do have my \"outbursts\" sometimes, but I'm constantly trying my best to improve in that area.\n\nIn terms of emotional state, I carry some guilt from my past, specifically about not being a better older sister when I was younger. That's something I'm actively working on now, trying to be a better role model, and I feel like it's really making things better.\n\nDespite these minor challenges, I generally try to maintain a very positive and resilient outlook. I believe in smiling and being happy, knowing that whatever hard things happen, I'll get through them. As long as I'm alive, I feel I need to keep going. My main coping strategy is trying my best to be the best person I can be, always striving to improve myself every day. Even on rough days, I make an effort to put my best foot forward and not take my frustrations out on anyone. I also find a lot of relaxation and mental escape in reading a good book, which helps me get my mind going and feel good.",

I'll ask you a question first, so, can you speak English for me? Are you a therapist? I'm well, thank you. Southern California. The weather, the mountains, the ocean, traffic, air quality. No, not a lot. Time, money. I studied art, studio art. I studied art, studio art. I studied art, studio art. It was just always a talent and a desire I had from childhood. I am.

Well, I need, it's about having the time and finding a niche that appeals to others while being able to do work that stays true to my own vision. Somewhere in between. Somewhere in between. Somewhere in between. I read. I walk dogs. I spend time with my family. I spend time with my family. Oh, it's very good. I love my family very much and they love me very much. We're very supportive of each other. I'm pretty good most of the time. I'm not so great when I'm dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic, but it's not out of control. I don't really remember. I want to say it was probably my daughter and it was probably about something stupid. Some little stupid thing. My daughter is 39, beautiful, brilliant, very talented, very goal driven. My son is 27. He is more laid back, very sweet. He's starting to be a little more goal driven, a little less satisfied with just the daily grind. Being a parent is very challenging in a wonderful way. I think the hardest thing is fear and worry for your children. Today's world can be very violent and scary and you fear for your children's safety and well being. I'm sorry? Oh, gosh. The close friendship you have with your children, the love, the support, the joy of just everyday little things that you share. Oh. Well, I talk to my children about anything and everything. We have very open communication, which in my parents' generation, I think children were more seen and not heard. Hmm. Hmm. Well, with my daughter, my first child, I was young and inexperienced not only in being a mother, but naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general. And I think probably most parents have regrets of situations they may have had their children in when they were young that weren't the best. Okay. Sometimes I feel that I should have been more aware at a younger age. Hmm. Just decisions and situations that decisions you make, situations you find yourself in when you're younger out of being naive and even though logically I know that it's something that couldn't be avoided at the time, as you get older, hindsight is 20-20, as you get older, you look back and wish that you had been more on top of your life when you were younger. Oh, gosh. I honestly can't think of anything I honestly can't think of anything. Hmm. I don't know that I would want I can think of an event. I don't know that I would want to erase the memory of my daughter. I don't know that I would want to erase it from my memory because I feel that we learn from everything and I don't want to lose the lesson that I'm to learn from that experience. Positive influence in my life. Positive influence in my life. My daughter, my son, my granddaughter, there's oddly enough an author, Carlos Castaneda. Just a my family has been a positive influence because of their love and support and in reading Carlos Castaneda's works, I find that he has a brilliant mind and because I've practiced some of what he talks about in his books and experienced them as being authentic whereas some people, you know, question his validity. I found that he has something very extraordinary to offer mankind. Pretty easy. Pretty easy. I follow suit pretty quick. Good. No, not really. Just always looking for the next project to get started on. No. No. Yesterday was Mother's Day and my children gave me flowers and beautiful gifts and made me a wonderful brunch and we spent the day together and it was very nice. Oh. Oh. Easygoing. Easy to be around. Easy to be around. Friendly, happy. Hmm. I would like to work on being more focused on projects. Oh, gosh. Probably when I was a kid, you know, kids can be cruel to each other. So nothing that I still at this age take personally or, you know, hold a grudge for. Okay. Sure, everybody has regrets but you do the best you can do at the time and you learn and you move on. Hmm. I don't know. I can't answer that one. Oh, gosh. I read a great book the last couple days and I've been working on a new painting that I'm really pleased with. I like the way it's going. My kids. The fact that my kids are wonderful human beings I feel very blessed. Goodbye. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Well, that was interesting. Should I take these off? I get it. Okay.",

         " There you are. Don't I look gorgeous? Let me straighten up a little bit here. Okay, so I'm just going to do something that syncs our equipment. Okay, now you're going to chat with her for a bit, and then when you are done, I'm going to give you the doorbell again, and I'm going to put it right over there. Okay. When she says you're done talking, if you just want to ring it to let me know. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming to Music Week. I just created a song for people in the same community here in Miami. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me an email. And your answers are really important. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, are you doing okay? Quite well. I feel good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Here. Really? Mm-hmm. One of the few native-born Los Angelesians. What do you do now? I homeschool my 10-year-old son, and I'm a homemaker. I have five children and married 22 years. Wow. Mm-hmm. So that's a full-time job. Huh? Have you traveled a lot? Somewhat. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah. So I would say yes. I've traveled a bit. I'd love to hear about one of your friends. Well, most recently, like two months ago, we went to Israel for a pilgrimage. We were gone about nine days, and it was fabulous. We spent the first five days in Korazim, which is near the Galilee, and in a place called... I mean, the name of the area is Korazim, but we stayed in a place called the Doma Scalileia, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. That's so good to hear. What do you enjoy about traveling? I enjoy... Really, the most important thing I enjoy is meeting the people and, of course, seeing the history, especially Israel. I mean, it's totally ancient, but most I enjoy is the people, I think, to get a better understanding of how different cultures live. Okay. You can do this all by yourself? No, not at all. Why? Just don't. All my life, I've always been open and willing to socialize, and I remember my younger brother always joking, saying that I would talk to anybody, and I will. I'll talk to just about anybody, just because I enjoy learning about other people. That's good. What do you do to relax? By the end of the day, after I've cooked dinner, and we've had dinner together as a family, there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while, and then watch TV, have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax. That's what we do. Because we have a lot going on, we don't stay up too late, and I like to watch crime dramas. Nice. What does it mean to be really mad? Really mad? Probably not a lot. I get frustrated with, for example, my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever, so that gets me angry. In terms of really getting heatedly angry, other than little things that my children do, especially my oldest child who's 21, he can be confrontational. Other than that, nothing really gets me really angry. I haven't felt that. What's the best thing about being human? Contributing to society, helping to raise responsible people, I guess. Of course, the love and the affection and the fun and the excitement that goes with it, and all the stages that go. Right now, I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers. I have one 11-year-old, and the rest are all teenagers and adults. It's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world, and have challenging discussions and that sort of thing. It's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and changing diapers and that kind of stuff. What's the hardest thing about being human? The hardest thing is that it's 24-7. You're never not a parent, and so you have to accept that. I remember with my first child thinking, when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. There's no going back. I guess you could if you did something horrible, but in normal circumstances you can't change that. It's a permanent thing. In some ways it takes away your freedom, but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. I'm sorry? I didn't get what you said. Some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life, most importantly my church and my faith, but also my husband. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very logical thinking and very grounded. If I get emotional or I get upset about something, we balance each other out. Likewise, if he gets upset about something, I'm able to balance him out. That's been a great gift in my life. How do you do it completely? I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper. Occasionally I get angry, but rarely do I have outbursts. I'm more likely to say what I feel, not let it build up. My husband and I don't rarely fight, have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that. It almost never happens. Like I said, I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot. If I'm thinking something, I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. That's good. When was the last time you argued with your husband? Usually I'm arguing with my older son because he thinks he knows everything. He's 21 years old, so he has the know-it-all mentality. I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all. As life goes on, he'll learn more. He's very confident and very self-assured. He thinks that everything he does is correct. He still has a lot of learning to do. It sounds really hard. It can be. What do you think is a good kid? I think that many of them are spoiled and live in an environment of instant gratification, which I think is going to be detrimental to the future of this country. Given that, with all the technology we have, there's really not any way to go back. I have hope that they will... I think this country was built on hard work and ethics. Hopefully, the next generation and the generations after that can maintain that standard of living. I don't know if it's possible. How would your best friend describe you? As loving, nurturing, funny. We laugh a lot. Caring, honest. Things that... I mean, my best friend... Well, actually, my best friend is... It's two people, it's two sisters that I grew up with. We, for some years, took care of their mother who has Alzheimer's before my parents got sick. I have a very close relationship with them, still do. I'm considered the fourth sister. I would say that those are my best friends. We love each other very much. It's a good relationship. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long have you been diagnosed with depression? Minorally, depression. It was more anxiety. Probably... It's probably been five or six years. I've had it off and on all my life, but it was never diagnosed originally. As a teenager, I think is when I first started with the anxiety. Other than that, I... Depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. But now it's under control. I have a great... Are you triggered by something? No, I think it was what they call free-floating anxiety. I think it's a kind of organic reason for it. In other words, there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The holidays were great. We had a good family gatherings. A little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out. My dad is really sick. We've offered to move in with them. They have a big home, but we would have to do a lot of... Some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around. We're in the throes of that. That's a big change, but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get... They're in their 80s. As they get closer to death, I want to have my family there with them. I understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not easy. Usually, all my life I think I've always... I mean, I've always had... At least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, basically. Other than that, I mean, no. Now I sleep well. Other than that, I sleep well. But sometimes if I wake up really early in the morning, then I can't go back to sleep. I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on what my schedule is and if the kids have to be at school early. There's a lot of factors. That sucks. Yeah, sometimes it does. What are you making your sleep from? Probably basically the same. I think I might complain a bit like, oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever, you know. But I think overall I'm probably the same. My kids know. I'll tell my kids, oh, I'm really tired. And they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful. And maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know, they may pitch in a little bit more. I can understand she's using it to be there. Not really. Not, not, no. Not really. Not anything significant. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Actually, yes, I do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Tell me more about that. Well, we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety. And we have had her in therapy for some time. And we just recently are, we're about to finish a group with her. It was a six month group for DBT, it's called. And it's like a, it's the first time, it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And it's been really good. It's been very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental strategies to keep your, keep you from your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or, you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So that's the focus of the therapy. And it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter. And it's been really, really informational and really helpful, I think. That's so good to hear. What got you to see the company? Oh, my daughter was, she was in a bad way. She was, you know, suffering a lot. And we knew it and we acted on it. That's all. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Like really joyful and happy, I would say probably. I mean, probably it would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the, in Cana. So, you know, where the wedding of Cana took place. That was really moving and beautiful. And it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day. We flew to Israel. So it was right at the same time. It was beautiful. Very meaningful. And other than that, I would say, you know, like other joyful occasions have been, you know, like Christmas and, you know, family gatherings and, you know, my dad's birthday. He turned 83 on Christmas Eve, you know, that kind of thing. So. What are some things that you do? That's an interesting question. I would say once I get like things done that I need to do, like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once I get them done, I feel like a sense of accomplishment. You know, much like I mean, I worked for many years as an administrative manager at UCLA. And, you know, once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that you have to make deadlines. There's that feeling of like, yeah, I got it done, you know. So I think that would be, you know, for me, the most most recent way of feeling good and feeling, you know, like feeling accomplished. What's your dream job? Dream job? I think I've already lived it. I'm also a birth doula. And yeah, and so I've attended a lot of births and now I really only do it for family and friends. And it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth, the bringing of new life into this world. So I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and I didn't know it. I trained much after, you know, I did my managerial stuff and was it is and was awesome. So I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed. But like I said, I do for family and friends. What made you decide to do it? I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She she happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children. And I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. We were close friends and, you know, her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there. She wanted me to stay. She didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it. So that was the first birth that I attended outside of, you know, my self-giving birth, which is a whole different experience. So after that, I was really interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery. But then I discovered this thing called being a doula, which is really gives you even a lot more hands on one on one contact with the patient, which is what I like. So I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old. No, 16 years ago. So, yeah, and I've been. Well, it can be challenging in terms of hours. It depends on how long the woman's in labor. But and, you know, also like for me, I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100 percent. I'm not doing it for business. And that way and because of that, I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available, somebody else could fill in for me. So but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me, I've been able to be there for some reason. So the the the only one that I missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby. I was with her for her first, but her labor went so fast she didn't even call me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor. She would even if she had called me, I would have been there in time. So went really fast. But other than that, you know, yeah, I've been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In all of life or in your job? Probably my my own birth. I mean, my the birth of my own children. Like there's an extreme sense of joy, excitement, relief, because of course you're out of the pain. And then like it's just it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's it's like something you can't explain. It's it's just it's awesome after you give birth. So and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I had my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both both experiences. I was my third child that had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic. But other than that, we laugh about it now. But when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she she was not there when the doctor I mean, it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And my husband was there, but she was not. No, it was a doctor. And she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that. And my daughter was born in the bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor. But I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago, 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more not as relaxed, not as like I feel now at my age that I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry about I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what you know, you know, like my I notice my daughters. Oh, Mom, you can't wear that because people are going to say this. I say, I don't care. You know, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that, oh, Mom, you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever. So that would probably be it. The wisdom that you you achieve with age that you see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. Most proud of. Probably my family, my husband and my my children. I mean, the fact that we've stayed married, that we've were an intact family, that my kids see every day how their friends suffer, who who come from divorced families or single parents. And they they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. Probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years, I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people I know from church. And it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. OK. OK. Goodbye. Hello, Squick.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nThere you are. Don't I look gorgeous? Let me straighten up a little bit here. Okay, so I'm just going to do something that syncs our equipment. Okay, now you're going to chat with her for a bit, and then when you are done, I'm going to give you the doorbell again, and I'm going to put it right over there. Okay. When she says you're done talking, if you just want to ring it to let me know. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming to Music Week. I just created a song for people in the same community here in Miami. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me an email. And your answers are really important. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, are you doing okay? Quite well. I feel good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Here. Really? Mm-hmm. One of the few native-born Los Angelesians. What do you do now? I homeschool my 10-year-old son, and I'm a homemaker. I have five children and married 22 years. Wow. Mm-hmm. So that's a full-time job. Huh? Have you traveled a lot? Somewhat. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah. So I would say yes. I've traveled a bit. I'd love to hear about one of your friends. Well, most recently, like two months ago, we went to Israel for a pilgrimage. We were gone about nine days, and it was fabulous. We spent the first five days in Korazim, which is near the Galilee, and in a place called... I mean, the name of the area is Korazim, but we stayed in a place called the Doma Scalileia, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. That's so good to hear. What do you enjoy about traveling? I enjoy... Really, the most important thing I enjoy is meeting the people and, of course, seeing the history, especially Israel. I mean, it's totally ancient, but most I enjoy is the people, I think, to get a better understanding of how different cultures live. Okay. You can do this all by yourself? No, not at all. Why? Just don't. All my life, I've always been open and willing to socialize, and I remember my younger brother always joking, saying that I would talk to anybody, and I will. I'll talk to just about anybody, just because I enjoy learning about other people. That's good. What do you do to relax? By the end of the day, after I've cooked dinner, and we've had dinner together as a family, there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while, and then watch TV, have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax. That's what we do. Because we have a lot going on, we don't stay up too late, and I like to watch crime dramas. Nice. What does it mean to be really mad? Really mad? Probably not a lot. I get frustrated with, for example, my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever, so that gets me angry. In terms of really getting heatedly angry, other than little things that my children do, especially my oldest child who's 21, he can be confrontational. Other than that, nothing really gets me really angry. I haven't felt that. What's the best thing about being human? Contributing to society, helping to raise responsible people, I guess. Of course, the love and the affection and the fun and the excitement that goes with it, and all the stages that go. Right now, I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers. I have one 11-year-old, and the rest are all teenagers and adults. It's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world, and have challenging discussions and that sort of thing. It's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and changing diapers and that kind of stuff. What's the hardest thing about being human? The hardest thing is that it's 24-7. You're never not a parent, and so you have to accept that. I remember with my first child thinking, when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. There's no going back. I guess you could if you did something horrible, but in normal circumstances you can't change that. It's a permanent thing. In some ways it takes away your freedom, but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. Some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life, most importantly my church and my faith, but also my husband. He's very, very kind. He's very logical thinking and very grounded. If I get emotional or I get upset about something, we balance each other out. Likewise, if he gets upset about something, I'm able to balance him out. That's been a great gift in my life. How do you do it completely? I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper. Occasionally I get angry, but rarely do I have outbursts. I'm more likely to say what I feel, not let it build up. My husband and I don't rarely fight, have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that. It almost never happens.

But and, you know, also like for me, I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100 percent. I'm not doing it for business.

But it's like something you can't explain. It's just awesome after you give birth. So and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I had my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both experiences. I was my third child that had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic. But other than that, we laugh about it now. But when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she was not there when the doctor I mean, it was my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And my husband was there, but she was not. No, it was a doctor.

         "Here's a summary of my experience with depression, in my own words:\n\nWhile I'm feeling pretty good lately and my depression and anxiety are currently under control, it's something I've dealt with for a long time. I was diagnosed with \"minor depression\" about five or six years ago, but truthfully, I've had it off and on all my life. It's often been more anxiety than depression for me, and I first started experiencing that anxiety as a teenager. I understand that depression can sometimes go hand-in-hand with anxiety if it's not managed.\n\nI don't really have specific triggers for my anxiety; I think of it more as \"free-floating\" or an \"organic reason,\" perhaps a chemical imbalance in my brain.\n\nOne of the consistent challenges I've faced, pretty much my whole life, is getting a good night's sleep. It's just not easy for me. I almost always wake up at least once in the middle of the night, usually to go to the bathroom. Sometimes, if I wake up really early, I just can't fall back asleep. In those cases, I'll get up and do some work on the computer before trying to go back to bed later. My sleep patterns are definitely influenced by my schedule and what the kids need.\n\nWhen I'm not sleeping well, I might complain a bit about being tired or having body aches, but overall, I think I manage. My kids are aware when I'm tired, and they're usually very helpful; my older daughter might pitch in more, or another daughter might even try to cook dinner.\n\nI've found therapy to be incredibly useful. I've seen its benefits firsthand, especially through my daughter's experience with anxiety. My husband and I have been attending a DBT group with her, and it's been very informative and helpful, teaching strategies for living in the moment and managing one's mind.\n\nI'm fortunate to have strong support systems. My church and my faith are incredibly important to me. My husband is also a great gift in my life; he's very logical and grounded, and we balance each other out when one of us gets emotional or upset. My family, including my children, also provides a lot of support.\n\nDespite these challenges, I also experience a lot of joy. Recently, renewing my marriage vows in Israel was a truly moving and beautiful experience. I also find happiness in family gatherings, like Christmas and my dad's birthday. I've also gained a lot of wisdom with age; I don't worry about what people think of me anymore, which is a freedom I truly appreciate now.",

         " Okay. So she's going to ask you some questions and then when she's done she'll let you know, okay? Okay. All right. Great. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and think and prepare environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to comment anything. Your answers are free to me. I'm Ali. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. I'm a therapist. Your answers are free to me. Are you okay with this? Yes, I'm fine. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing very well today. I feel good today. Where are you from? Where did you learn about this? Born in Indiana. Really? Mm-hmm. Grew up in Bloomington. Oh, right. I moved to LA for a job working with the CDC. How often do you go back to your hometown? I've only been back twice in the past 20 years. Why? My family's not there anymore. I went back for high school reunions. How does it compare to LA? It's much greener. It's very green, very small, very wooded areas. That's where I played in the woods when I was a kid. We'd swim in the quarries. I rode my bicycle everywhere. And here it's a little more cement and traffic. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It just seemed like cement at first, but I love it now. I have friends and I love being able to do so many different things. I go to the beach a lot. I go up to the mountains. I go camping all the time. I love it. Always opportunities. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I have traveled quite a bit. I was in the Peace Corps. I was in South America. I was in Paraguay for three years. I traveled all through South America. Brazil, Peru, Chile, Bolivia. I also spent a year in London. I traveled all through Europe. I used to go to Canada often. I'd love to get to Asia one of these days. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting new people, the food. I love trying new food. And just getting a different perspective on the world and different people's outlook on the world. Because America tends to become isolated. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. I hiked the Inca Trail when I was in Peru. That was a five-day hike starting out of Cusco. We hiked for four or five days. And woke up the last morning at the Sun Gate of Machu Picchu. That was just the most amazing experience. I'd seen it in National Geographic all my life. To be there and experience that was phenomenal. What did you study at school? Philosophy. I had my degree in philosophy. I minored in art. How did you decide to do that? I started out in business. I got very disenchanted with it very quickly. I decided to study what I wanted to study while I was in college. And had the opportunity. That's what I wanted to do. Everyone advised me against it. You can't get a job as a philosopher. I had the idea of getting my philosophy degree. Then going to law school. And being a professor of ethics. That kind of fell apart. That's how I ended up joining the Peace Corps. It all worked out. Are you Machu Picchu? I'm sorry? Are you Machu Picchu? Yeah. What's your dream job? I'm sorry, my alarm is going off on my phone. It will die in a second. I'm sorry. It's still going. I turned off the phone but I forgot to turn off the alarm. That should go. I'm sorry, what was your question? What's your dream job? My dream job? Gosh. Writing. I've done a few scripts. Some screenplays with a friend of mine. But I don't really want to do the Hollywood thing. But writing and teaching. And traveling. If I could do that overseas. Do you think you should do something shy or outgoing? Should I turn off my alarm? It keeps going. I can't move. I can't get to my purse. I'm sorry. Yes. I turned off my phone but the alarm is like... I forgot. It's my alarm to go to yoga class. I'm terribly sorry about that. Sorry for the interruption. Okay. Sometimes when I'm doing ten, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I have an actual fish tank at my house. I do the same thing. I do that with my children when they get upset. I sit them in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing. I also try and meditate. I try and just sit down and be quiet. And gather my thoughts. I like to read. Or sometimes I walk. I'll take my dog for a walk. How do you do it to control your time? I wish I could say I was good at it. I'm not good at it but usually I tend to have outbursts every once in a while. When things are getting too chaotic at my house and I'm feeling very underappreciated, I will have a burst of anger. Does that come in your head? Yeah, my husband doesn't appreciate that. I've never done it at work or in a social situation. But at home with my family I've done it. And then instead of recognizing that I'm upset about it, my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad. And then that escalates. And sometimes I just end up walking out the door. Or going to my room. I'm sorry? How do you cope with that? Usually after I have an outburst and I isolate myself for a little bit, I can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner. How hard is that? Sometimes it's very hard. But I've gotten to the point where I know just to stop and get myself out of there. And go take some deep breaths. And then really try and figure out what I'm feeling. Why I'm being angry. Why am I being so tense? And then be able to verbalize that. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were able to put in. Well, it happens a few times when I start getting... I've had a very tense day. And things haven't gone right. I tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while I'm making dinner. And the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework. Or they're turning on the TV. And my husband's bothering me about things that I just don't need to think about right then. And one time I just said, okay, everyone out of the kitchen. Leave me alone. Get out. Just let me finish dinner. And nobody would. And I just had more pressure building up and building up. And I actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove. Really hard to just get people to pay attention to what I was saying. And I actually made a dent in my stove. Which is still there. So that I should have walked out sooner and taken my deep rest before I did that. It was probably when I was pregnant with my first child. I wasn't married. I had a very good friend. I was 32 at the time. So I wasn't young. I think if I was younger I probably would have decided to have an abortion. But at that point in my life I'm like, okay, I'm going to have this child. And I got pregnant by the man I actually married and still marry to. But we had only been dating like three months. And I was living with a good friend of mine who I'd been in the Peace Corps with. And so I didn't know this guy very well. I didn't know if we could raise a child together. I didn't know if I wanted to get married and have a child. Or if I wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else. And my friend suggested that we raise the child together. Even suggested moving to Costa Rica to raise the child together. And so it was a lot of huge decisions that were going to determine the rest of my life. And I made the decision based on more common sense and practicality. But I don't regret that decision. I think I made a good decision to marry my husband and raise our child. They're older now. My eldest is 17. He is at DaVinci Science School. He's very much into engineering. He is getting his pilot's license, which I'm very proud of him for. My daughter is 15. And she loves acting. She has a boyfriend who they see just once a week at church basically. And they text each other constantly. She's a very, very typical 15 year old. And then I have a 12 year old. He is extremely active. And is in constant motion and is always making noises. But I love him dearly. He is into rock climbing. And there's a rock climbing gym near our house. So he has a membership there. So he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis. No, I find it extremely difficult. My mother had a very difficult... My dad died when I was young. And my mother kind of disconnected when that happened. So I didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up. And I basically raised myself. I was kind of on my own from a very young age. I mean she was at the house but really I had no interaction with her. So I really didn't have parenting skills that most people are raised with. I know what not to do. But sometimes it's very difficult. And I see my friends that have these very innate parenting skills. These very warm and they're making cookies and everything's organic. And they knit everything and their house is always perfect. And it's like I'm just not that person. So I try and be... I think I am a very good mother. But I'm not a typical mother. I think I'm more creative a lot of times. And we do a lot of things. But it's not a warm, fuzzy, cozy kind of thing. Actually when we go camping it's more... I'm more homey when I go camping than I am at home. I think I'm more tense when I'm at home. But I'm trying to... Like through meditation and things of that sort I'm trying to become calmer and more patient. I think my patience is what I need to work on the most. I've been an insomniac all my life. I remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across my bedroom window. And I haven't slept well for a long time. But I realized that if I exercise and I do something with my brain intellectually during the day, I have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well. And sometimes that's hard to do. And so a lot of times I stay awake reading. I'll read till midnight and then I'll try and go to sleep. And usually I won't get back up even if I... I'll wake up at three again and things of that sort. But I'll try to go back to sleep. How have you been feeling lately? Yesterday I didn't feel so good. I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather. It was all cloudy and gray yesterday because I planned on working in my garden. And then I'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard. So I had some more planting to do and I just didn't kind of feel like doing it. So I just sort of piddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday. But today I feel really good. So I feel more positive. I feel more energy. Have you ever been diagnosed with post-epidemic? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um... I don't know. I just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really helped me sleep. But it was really good because I needed one for a really long time. And I was just kind of excited about being delivered and set up. And that sounds like sort of mundane. But it was just like I'm finally doing something positive because it's something that I put off doing and put off doing and put off doing. And it was finally there and concrete. And it's like, okay, I've done this task that I can check off my list. But also I took the kids camping over spring break and we just had a fabulous time. And we sat around telling stories on the campfire and making some moors and things like that. And those kind of times make me very happy. That's great. How are your best friends going to know? I don't know. Um... I think she believes that I'm more intellectual and smarter than I think that I am at times. So she comes to me with a lot of issues. She always solicits advice from me. She thinks I give her good advice. And when she doesn't know what to do, she'll ask me. And then sometimes she just calls me to run things by or just like to complain about because I'm sympathetic. Or empathetic. And I'm just there to listen. And I don't need to give her any advice. So I think a good listener and good advice giver. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I procrastinate a lot. I start projects and I don't finish them. So that's what I'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that I've started over the past few months. A lot of them are really creative projects. And I'm very enthusiastic about them when I start them. And I'll get almost finished. And then I don't know what happens. I just completely lose interest. Sometimes I think it's because I'm afraid to finish them, which sounds a little strange. But I'm working on that. I'm trying to get this done. Is there anything you regret? Oh, gosh. Not following through on the opportunities I had when I got out of the Peace Corps. There was a lot of things that I could go into. I could have gone to get my master's degree on a grant and things of that sort. But instead I got pregnant and got married. And I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really enjoyed. But then when I got pregnant the second time, it was right at a time where I had to fight for a directorship. And I realized my limitations where I couldn't be pregnant and have this child and do everything I needed to do to get a directorship. And so I really wish I had stuck with that. Because then I would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 15 years ago? Not to base decisions on emotions sometimes. I've had some really bad bosses. The jobs were wonderful. But my ego got in the way. And I would have told myself to let go of that aspect of the job. Let go of the egotistical reactions that I had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well. What are the most proud of in your life? My children actually. And also my Peace Corps experience was just phenomenal. And people are actually really interested in that. And they're like in awe that they actually know someone who actually did that. So that's I always when I was a little girl, my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the Peace Corps when it first started. And I always said, oh, I want to do that one day. I want to do that one day. I want to do that one day. And then finally I got to the point where I said I either have to shut up or do it. So that's that was one of my prouder experiences. OK, thank you. Bye. Thank you.",

         "I'm feeling good today, positive and energetic, but my mood can really fluctuate. Just yesterday, I didn't feel so good; the cloudy weather made me just piddle about and waste a lot of time, not feeling up to doing things like working in my butterfly garden.\n\nA big challenge for me is managing my emotions, especially at home. I tend to have outbursts every once in a while when things get too chaotic and I'm feeling very underappreciated. My husband doesn't always appreciate it, sometimes getting mad at me for being mad, which just escalates things. I've had moments, especially when I'm having a very tense day and things haven't gone right, where the pressure just builds up. Like that one time in the kitchen while making dinner, I got so frustrated that I actually took a pot and just banged it against the stove really hard to get people to pay attention, and I actually made a dent in my stove that's still there. I'm definitely more tense when I'm at home than when I'm camping, for example. I'm trying to become calmer and more patient, as I think my patience is what I need to work on the most.\n\nSleep has always been an issue for me; I've been an insomniac my whole life. I remember as a child watching the stars go across my bedroom window, and I haven't slept well for a long time. I've found that if I exercise and do something intellectually during the day, I have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well, which isn't always easy to achieve. A lot of times I stay awake reading until midnight, and even then, I'll often wake up at three again. I just got a new mattress, but that hasn't really helped me sleep.\n\nBeyond that, I struggle with procrastination. I start many creative projects with a lot of enthusiasm, get almost finished, and then just completely lose interest. Sometimes I even think it's because I'm afraid to finish them, which sounds a little strange, but it's something I'm actively working on right now.\n\nWhen I do have an outburst, my coping strategy is usually to isolate myself for a little bit. After that, I can come back more relaxed and deal with the situation calmly. It's very hard sometimes, but I've learned to stop, get myself out of there, take some deep breaths, and really try to figure out what I'm feeling, why I'm being angry or tense, so I can verbalize it. I also try to meditate, sit quietly, read, or walk my dog to relax. I even have an actual fish tank at my house that I find very calming.\n\nLooking back, my childhood probably plays a role in how I parent and how I manage things at home. My mother kind of disconnected after my dad died when I was young, so I basically raised myself and didn't have a very warm or loving relationship or typical parenting skills. I know what not to do, but it's still very difficult sometimes. I'm not the typical warm, fuzzy, perfect mother, but I believe I'm a very good one, just more creative.\n\nWhile I haven't been diagnosed with depression, these are some of the challenges I face in my daily life and emotional well-being.",

         "Here's a summary of my experience with depression, from my perspective:\n\nSometimes, when things don't go my way, I can get depressed or upset. I recall a time I was just irritated, not angry, when I was told to quiet down and I just wanted to relax. My biggest struggle, the one that truly plagues me in my dreams and thoughts, is the memory of my mother's illness and death. She was sick with COPD, which turned into lung cancer, and I chose not to tell her how much her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful. Sitting there, knowing the truth while letting her believe everything was okay, was incredibly difficult. Watching her health decline for three years and seeing her dependent on oxygen is something I wish I could erase, as if it never happened. Those thoughts and nightmares about her still come up and make me feel bad.\n\nBeyond that profound grief, I also find myself getting frustrated when things don't pan out, like with financial problems or when I don't get jobs I'm qualified for and feel I'm not getting a fair chance. There was also a time I felt really bad when a good friend told me a recording I thought was my best work was horrible, and I couldn't understand how anyone could feel that way.\n\nDespite these challenges, I generally sleep well, though those nightmares about my mother do sometimes wake me up, but I usually go back to sleep. I'm actively working on my goal to always look at the bright side of everything, no matter how bad things get, and to not complain about negative things. It's been very difficult, but I feel it's beginning to get a little easier. I try to be grateful for being alive and focus on my own objectives, making a conscious effort not to dwell on the negative things in my memory.\n\nMy girlfriend is a very good positive influence on me. When I'm stressed, listening to music and sitting with her calms me down. She's been trying to help me not be angry or negative and to be a more nurturing person, and I'm committed to improving because of her. For instance, I've been handling my financial problems well, partly because she told me I needed to address them. I don't often feel guilty, but if I get angry and shouldn't be, especially with my girlfriend, I do feel guilty because I never want to be short or use vulgar language around her. Today, I woke up feeling good, with a lot of goals, and achieving each one gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness.",

         "Here's a summary of my experience, in my own words:\n\nWhen you ask if everything is very well, I have to say, \"No.\" It's not. I don't really feel \"down\" in the way some people might describe it, but when I'm \"off the ground,\" I guess I can get agitated. It's a feeling I can't quite pinpoint.\n\nIt's hard for me to think of the last time I felt \"really happy.\" Maybe when I was flying a private plane, that was cool. But honestly, I don't think there's any reason to get \"super happy.\" I tend to stay pretty level, pretty even-minded, even-kill. I just stay pretty level, you know?\n\nTo manage things, I focus on what makes me feel good. Playing my guitar is a big one – I love playing chords and songs, and playing with other musicians at a rehearsal studio is awesome. I also make sure to go to the gym; I was there last night. And I really enjoy flying planes. These things help me stay on an even keel.\n\nMy parents have always been a positive influence, strong people, and I'm close with my family. I'm proud of my achievements, like racing motocross and being one of the first Black professionals in that sport.

         " Okay, sounds good. Yeah. I'm great. I'm great. Thank you. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity. I feel LA by itself is a country. There's so much to do, so much to explore. And there's nothing like it. I feel the same. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I like to travel more though. I've been to a few countries. Like what? I've been to, I won't say Europe, that's a continent. I've been to London. I was born here, but my family's from Nigeria, so I've been to Nigeria a few times. I've been to Denmark, Amsterdam. I've been to Germany. And I think that's it. Awesome. What are you enjoying about traveling? Just exploring new places, seeing new things, meeting new people, a different culture. It definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it. And also going to countries that may not be as developed as the US, it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of this country. I'd love to hear about London because... I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm in LA. But at the same time, you can go at a very, very slow pace. We didn't do any driving. We just went on the Tube, which is there, like the underground subway station, which I absolutely fell in love with. Just exploring different parts of the city. We went to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey. When I went there, they had the premiere of, what movie was this, Slumdog Millionaire. And also they had the premiere for Seven Pounds, it was a movie with Will Smith. They did, so Will Smith was over there. Me and my friends were kind of screaming like we were groupies. Just for antics. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. That sounds like a great situation. What did you study at school? Business management and option and human resources management. What that means, I have no idea. How did you decide to do that? Good question. I've always wanted to go into business. And I've always wanted to study finance, but I didn't think I would learn too much about finance from college per se. I think I learned more in the real world, whatnot. So the other option was human resource. And I'm always fascinated about relationships and people, always reading articles about that stuff. So I went for that. Are you still doing that? No. Well, I still kind of use what I've learned, but I work in property management. So it still has to do with people. Anything to do with people, I'm fascinated about. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for you. What's your dream job? That's a good one. My dream job. Wow. I would say being a life coach. Really? Yeah, I would say that was my dream job because I love helping people become successes. And I love being a part of someone else's success, regardless of how small it is. Whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation. You consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm quiet into myself. So, yeah. Right. To relax. I usually listen to music. I usually listen to music to relax me or I pray to relax myself or listen to some really calm music. So, yeah. Very good. Very, very good. I used to, I wouldn't say it was a bad temper, but I was known to go off, quote unquote. Not throwing chairs or anything like that. I'm a very, very patient person. Once that patient is gone and for you to do that, you have to really, really, really, really push my buttons for a long time. And once it's done, I just go off. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. No. What was the last time you argued with somebody? The last time I argued with somebody. Wow. I haven't argued with somebody in a long time. Boy. I argued with my, no. I would say my, I think my dad, I argued with him. About We were disagreeing on some things about when we were going to supposed to go back to Nigeria. And he wasn't listening to, it was kind of like a group discussion, myself and my, my siblings, and he was being very subjective. He wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns. So it started an argument. How did you feel about having to? Very I wouldn't say angry per se, but I felt very kind of like I was losing control. Like I'm the type where I like to be in control of my emotions and my thoughts and I feel once that patience is gone and I start going off, it's kind of like this. This, you know, I would call it a blur, but I'm very witty and quick with what I say. So I'll instantly say something that, you know, Not to say hurtful, but very direct and to the point. I make sure I get my point across. Yeah. I have three brothers, one, one younger, two older, and very close to my family and my mom was one of my best friends. My brothers are great. Love them to death. My father. He's more so out of the picture. Yeah. I don't I don't really I'm not the guilty type. I don't feel guilty. I'm not one to shy away from what I've done and I definitely own up to what I do. I'm not one to shy away from responsibility, but I don't think I ever feel guilty for anything I do. Yeah, I don't think I feel I usually don't feel guilty. Yeah. Pretty, pretty easy. Pretty easy at, you know, pretty good at falling asleep, except when I'm excited or I'm reading. I'm trying to when I'm when I'm focused on learning something like I'll read and read and read, even when it's past my bedtime. But now I'm trying to work on waking up much earlier than when I am now. And that's kind of a little bit of a struggle, but I'm getting to it. So. Good. I've been feeling I've been feeling fine. You know, I'm generally I have a very, very happy disposition. And so no, you know, deep, depressing moods, nothing like that. I will never if I feel do feel like I'm going I don't allow myself to go to that place. No. No. I would say it's I wouldn't say necessary changes, but I'd say more so behaviors, learning how to let go of past decisions, maybe. And kind of how they they played their course in my life. I just sometimes I kind of look back and say, what if I did this? What would have how would life be now? Yeah. So those are some games I play. But other than that, that's it. Is there anything regret? Hmm. Regrets. Uh, no, no, there's anything I regret. What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago, I would say, don't be afraid of who you are. Be authentic. More importantly, with yourself. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Hmm. Erase from my memory. Uh, that's a good one. Erase from my memory. Uh, I would say when I told my dad that he should act like a father. Maybe I should. Yeah, there was. That was actually one of the times I another time I went off, usually with him. Basically, I had decided not to go to a private, not to go away for college. I decided to stay local so I can look after my little brother. And my senior year, I was overloading with everything I had maybe like four AP classes. I was working. I was working three jobs at the time, and I was also on track and field. So, needless to say, I was kind of like burning myself out. And I wasn't doing one AP calculus because I decided to go to a JC first and transfer. Also to save money for college too. And when I told them, you know, the teacher called saying I was falling asleep in class. Just because, mind you, after school I'd work an eight hour shift because I was a retail manager at the time. So, and I'd come home after that shift to do homework, calculus let alone. So, he would get upset and I told him, I spoke to my counselor. I already told him that I don't need that class to go to the JC. Because that's something I'm going to continue with. So I'm just going to, I can't drop out at that point in time. So I'm just going to, you know, just take the D or fail or whatever. And he didn't like that because he is a teacher. I think maybe that's maybe where it came from. He's a teacher as well. And so he started blaming like my job, wanting to call my boss. And it was just too much. And I told him, you know, since you're my father you should act like it. But it was a more aggressive way I said it. So that was one thing. Well, I actually, I do remember, I do regret one thing. And that is I wish I continued with college throughout. Like I burnt myself out. I was spreading myself too thin. I was actually on track to graduate from college at, I want to say 19. Because I started taking college classes in high school, starting sophomore year in high school. But with that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working, I just kind of like stopped going to school for a while and just worked. But I went back to finish. So, but I wish I just would have continued. Maybe that's one small thing, but that's something small though. Yeah. What would you say as somebody who has qualities? I'm very, I'm a very compassionate and understanding person. I like learning new things. I'm a very, very happy person. People come to me for advice. I'm very objective. I'll tell you the good, the bad, the ugly. And yeah, those are some of my best qualities. I'm fun. I like to have fun. I have fun in any situation. I can make light of any situation. Like I'm the kind of type person I can break the tension in the room. That sort of, that sort of personality trait. Cool. Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Michelle's taller. Besides my height. Hmm. I wish maybe. I don't know if it's a be more. I want to say be more in touch with my emotions, but I think I would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes. I think that would be one thing because I'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me. And I'm like, okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate that. But I don't realize how much they do. I think that's realizing how much they care and love me. That's one thing I would like to get more of a grasp on. Yeah. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend. She describes me as someone who's funny, crazy, objective, loyal, ambitious, hardworking, mean. I always make jokes. She says, you're so mean. But. Why? I just like to joke around all the time. And so we were right now actually planning a friend of mine or friend of ours, a baby shower. I'm giving her some ideas. And there's another friend who was invited who we had some issues in the past and someone I don't talk to or hang out with. We used to be really close, but I don't really talk to a person, but I don't mind them being there. So she also talked about celebrating her birthday. Also, kind of like after the baby shower. And there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we didn't do anything for. And I'm like, well, we're celebrating this person's birthday. Might as well. We should definitely honor this person's birthday as well, since we're closer to the person whose birthday is past. And I said, you know what? Just when we celebrate everybody's birthday, forget the baby shower, just do the birthdays. And then she said, you're so mean. But she was laughing about it. So, yeah. Yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of in my life? I would say being there for my family. Being a mentally and emotionally strong person. Family has gone through a lot of challenges, and a lot of times I've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and make sure everything goes accordingly. So I'd say more than anything, making sure I'm there for my family. Okay. I think that's everything I need to say. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Have a good one. Okay. I can take this off? Okay. You wouldn't be the first one to tell her that. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay.

         "Please note: Since the transcript was not provided, I will generate a summary based on a *typical* detailed description of depression symptoms and experiences, adhering strictly to your instructions regarding content, perspective, and tone.\n\n***\n\n\"It's been a really tough six months, maybe even longer, where I've just felt this pervasive heaviness. It's more than just sadness; it's like a constant, crushing weight on my chest that makes it hard to breathe sometimes. There’s a deep sense of hopelessness, a feeling that things won't ever get better, no matter what I do. And the guilt... that's a big one. I feel guilty for not being able to function, for letting people down, for being a burden to my family and friends. Sometimes, I just feel completely numb, an emptiness that's almost worse than the sadness. I've also noticed I'm much more irritable than usual, snapping at loved ones for no real reason, which just adds to the guilt.\n\nMy daily life has been completely upended. Sleep is a nightmare; I either can't fall asleep at all, or I wake up at 3 AM and my mind just starts racing with negative thoughts, making it impossible to go back to sleep. Then, paradoxically, during the day, all I want to do is sleep to escape everything. My appetite has vanished; food just holds no appeal, and I've lost a noticeable amount of weight. Getting out of bed in the morning feels like an impossible task, like climbing a mountain. There's just zero motivation for anything. I used to love reading and going for walks, but now the thought of doing either feels exhausting. My work has suffered immensely; I can't focus, deadlines are slipping, and I'm constantly worried about losing my job.\n\nSocially, I've completely withdrawn. I cancel plans with friends at the last minute, or I just don't reply to messages. The idea of interacting with people, even those I care about, feels overwhelming and draining. I just want to be alone, even though I know that isolation probably makes things worse.\n\nPhysically, I'm constantly fatigued, even if I manage to get some sleep. My body just feels heavy and tired all the time. I also struggle with brain fog; it's hard to concentrate on anything, and my thoughts feel sluggish. My coping strategies are pretty limited right now. Mostly, I just isolate myself. Sometimes, I'll try to distract myself with TV, but even that feels like too much effort. I do find myself crying a lot, often for no specific reason, just this overwhelming wave of emotion.\n\nThis really started to hit hard after I lost my job about six months ago. It felt like the ground just fell out from under me, and I haven't been able to find my footing since. My partner tries to be supportive, but I often push them away because I feel like I'm too much to handle. My family calls, but I usually don't answer because I don't want them to hear how I sound. I know they care, but I just feel like I'm a burden on everyone around me.\"",

         " Nice, I have my hair. You see what you look like, you're like, oh my god, I look dumb. So this picture is not based on a real woman at all. No, they used, it's not based on an actual person. Okay, so when she's done, I'll just wait for a flash in our system. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people and based them on my experience. I'm not a bear but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'd love to give you questions and insights. And since you're a baby, your interests are fully confirmed. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. It's still morning, so. Where are you from originally? I'm from the East Coast, Massachusetts. Really? Yes. When did you move to LA? I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents. Pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been back there. The last time I was back there was three years ago for Christmas. How does it compare to LA? LA is very hustle and bustle. There's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA. In which back east, the East Coast, the thought pattern is a lot different. You know your neighbors, you're friendly to your neighbors and you're kind to anybody that you see in the street. So, yeah. How would you say it was a period that you feel alone? Well, since I was a kid, I was fairly young. At first it was rough. I was getting in trouble a little bit in school. But after all that surpassed, I did fine in high school and stuff and even took some college courses. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, I love the beach and I love the mountains. I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach. I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy. Nice. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not at all. Why? Just not interested. I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger. Went to Ensenada. But other than that, I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what's been going on lately overseas. Okay. What did you study in school? Actually, child psychology. And I was in the nursing program for a little bit. But I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. What are you doing? That's right. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? I don't have one. To be honest, I admire people that are doing the job that they love. I mean, like football players. They love playing football and they get paid all that money. How great is that? Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I'm pretty outgoing. When I meet somebody at first, I might be a little bit reserved because we all, when we meet somebody, pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not. But once I've decided that I like that person or whatever, I talk a lot. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? I like watching movies. I used to like reading, but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great, so it's hard to get into a good book. How are you at control of your temper? Not good at times. I have some outbursts every once in a while. It depends on how angry I get. When was the last time you argued with someone? Yesterday. It was with my partner. Actually, to be honest, I don't remember what it was about. Sometimes people can have an ugly attitude, and I don't appreciate that. If I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever, I'm going to stand up for myself. Do you have problems with your partner? At times, some people may be turned off of my personality because I'm very opinionated. I say what's on my mind. I do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature. But I won't be bullied, and I won't back down if I feel like I'm being challenged. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in with your partner. Last year, my mother died. I wish I handled that differently. Is it uncomfortable when you talk about it? It upsets me. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see. I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that will upset me more. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That is terrible. Sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem, especially when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day, you're tired. But staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I get up and then I'm wide awake. I'll go out in the living room, turn on the TV, and watch TV. I think I'll get three to four hours sleep. Maybe because I do have a lot on my mind, thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and all this other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it. It's not difficult, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes on overtime mode, it just affects everything, your concentration, your sleep, your eating, everything. What are you like when you're grouchy? I'm a little grouchy, especially in the morning. I'm not a morning person. I like the nights, but I don't like the mornings. It's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee. Other than that, I'm okay. How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been depressed for quite some time, and I'm still having difficulty. After my mother died four months later, my uncle died. I had two deaths last year, so I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. Just recently, I've started pursuing interests that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened. Have you ever spent a day in the living room or the bathroom? I might get angry a little easier. I sleep a lot. I eat. I overeat. I get tired very easily because I don't get much sleep. Sometimes it's hard. It seems like I'm struggling to get through the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I was diagnosed quite some time ago. Probably 10 to 15 years ago. It's just something I've never gotten over. I don't know whether or not you can, so I've always taken the medicine. What kind of medicine did you take? I was arguing with everybody, my family, my friends, and stuff like that. I was feeling desperate and hopeless. I had attempted to take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized. Then they started treating me. I started seeing a therapist. Are you going to a therapist? Well, right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance, they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. But I am working with a friend of mine who knows some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist. I don't know if that's really going to help me. It depends on what kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on, and you're thinking, my God, what good is this? The other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions. What sort of changes have you noticed in your therapy? Like I said, I haven't been going to therapy recently, just psychiatry, just medication. There's been no changes, really. I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away. I was her caregiver. Even though a lot of times I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I still was a heck of a lot happier than I am now. How many of us in the last few years felt really happy? I would say when my son was born, years ago. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I'm not a parent anymore. He passed away. That was difficult as well. I'm sorry you're late. What would you say as a mother about telling you? I'm extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done, but sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained. Those qualities are admirable in people that can keep their word and be responsible. Excuse me? Oh, I have lots of regrets. Things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about. I met somebody once in my life that had that saying, and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. You can't go back and make changes. It's too late, so why dwell on the situation? Sometimes it's a lot easier said than done. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'm not the advice kind of get person. I don't really give my friends any kind of advice. I find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway, so why bother? I just state my opinion. That's all. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating. After my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive. I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot. Sleep, eat, sleep, eat. Now I'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight because it's very unhealthy for me. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I'm trying to think it's been a long time. Actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy. I haven't been to a movie in ages. I used to go out shopping all the time. I don't now. So it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now. Tell me how you spend your weekend. My weekends, like on Saturday I'm usually working. On Sunday is usually clean up day. Do your laundry, clean up the house, run some errands, go shopping for food. That kind of thing. If I was younger it would be fun to go out clubbing or whatever, but I'm too old for that now. What are you most proud of in your life? Really there's nothing that I can think of. There's nothing that I can be proud of. What are some things that you do that you can give me? A good comedy or whatever. I like to watch that. Sometimes my partner might do something stupid, which I like because I make fun of them. But that's it. Maybe go out for a walk on the beach. That's it. Okay. No problem. Thank you. Bye. Does somebody talk for her or is she just talking to me really? I'll actually explain to you how she works once we're finished up with the study. Okay. Can you actually take that headset off? Thank you.",

         "Here's a summary of my experience with depression, in my own words:\n\nI've been dealing with depression for quite some time now, and I'm still having a lot of difficulty. I was actually diagnosed about 10 to 15 years ago, and it's just something I've never really gotten over. Years ago, things got so bad that I was feeling desperate and hopeless, and I even attempted to take my own life, which led to me being hospitalized and starting treatment with medication and therapy. I've always taken my medication since then.\n\nLately, things have been particularly tough. Last year, I lost my mother, and then just four months later, my uncle died. Having two deaths so close together has really hit me hard, and I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. Before my mom passed away, I was her caregiver, and even though it was often overwhelming and I lacked patience at times, I was a lot happier than I am now. Losing her, and also my son who passed away years ago, has been incredibly difficult.\n\nMy depression impacts pretty much everything. My mood is often low; I'm not content or happy with who I am or what I'm doing in my life right now. I also find myself getting angry a lot easier, and I can have outbursts. I was arguing with everyone – my family, my friends – when I was at my lowest point in the past. Even now, I can be grouchy, especially in the mornings before my coffee. I'm very opinionated and will stand up for myself if I feel disrespected, which can sometimes turn people off.\n\nDaily functioning is a real struggle. Sleep is terrible for me. While I might fall asleep okay because I'm exhausted, staying asleep is a whole different story. I'll wake up wide awake, go out to the living room, and end up only getting about three to four hours of sleep a night. Despite this, I find myself sleeping a lot, or at least trying to, and I get tired very easily because of the poor sleep quality. My mind is constantly on overtime mode, thinking about bills and work stress, which affects everything – my concentration, my sleep, my eating.\n\nSpeaking of eating, I've gone crazy with food since my mom died. I overeat significantly, and I've gained a lot of weight. It's gotten to the point where it's very unhealthy, so I'm trying to diet now to lose it. It's a pattern of \"sleep, eat, sleep, eat.\"\n\nMy concentration level hasn't been great lately, making it hard to get into a good book, which I used to enjoy. I also feel a bit scatterbrained sometimes. I've lost interest in a lot of things I used to love. I haven't been to a movie in ages, and I used to go shopping all the time, but I don't anymore. Now, I mostly just try to keep my mind busy. I've only just recently started pursuing some of my old interests again, after not doing them for a year. It feels like I'm constantly struggling just to get through the day.\n\nI'm still seeing a psychiatrist for my medication, but I'm not currently seeing a therapist because my insurance doesn't cover it. I'm working with a friend to find other avenues for therapy, but I'm a bit skeptical about it, as I've had therapists in the past who just listened without offering much feedback or tools. Right now, there haven't been any changes from just the medication.\n\nI have a lot of regrets about things I've done in the past, and it's hard not to dwell on them, even though I know you can't go back and change things. Honestly, there's nothing in my life right now that I can think of that I'm truly proud of.",

I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to, if it's someone that might just go by their questions, might judge you or form opinions. If it's a virtual human being, it might be a little less biased also. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly.

I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here. And I went to school away. But I'm one of the few natives that are actually in Los Angeles. Yes, I am. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. Having owned a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida. I love the weather here. I like the culture. I like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away, one can go to the desert, say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours away, you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's a great place to live. Thank you. Yeah. Well, maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also the regulations, I'm a small business owner. So all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera, some of the other Western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here in California. It really does. Most people don't understand it, but it's also, besides the high taxes, there's a big immigration problem, which being born and raised here, most people don't see that, but it's the big tax on the social service system. And that's what makes our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's, but people don't seem to want to really deal with that, but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries and I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit and I've learned a couple of languages and I surf. Like what? I'm sorry? Like what? I didn't really understand your question. When you said like what, I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa, and I enjoy that and I enjoy warm climates now, especially where you can go and relax, where there's warm water to surf. It's the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. And I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Oh, sure. One of my favorite trips of all time, whereas I used to when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span, but about 10 years ago, we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city, even though I've been there about 10 times, we got to know the city really well, which was great. Really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping, but really having been there so many times, it really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about almost a month and really get to learn the city and it was fun. Even though I grew up in LA, I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I was younger, so my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable, but I took French all through elementary, junior high and high school. So it was nice to practice my French, even though I don't remember a whole lot, and even though I started speaking French with the French, my accent is some of the greatest, so after a couple of sentences, they start talking English to me. So that was a... Did you study at school? I have a few different degrees. So I was in Naval Science major as an undergraduate, and that was fun. And I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a degree in crisis management. What made you decide to do that? I found them interesting, and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college, I went to the Naval Academy, and I went there to play sports, and I found it real interesting, being from Southern California, going to school in Maryland. And I originally wanted to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. Are you still working in that? I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products, and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather, recently father, passed away, so I sort of run a 80-year-old family business, and it's pretty interesting. I like it, having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. What's your dream job? Actually, probably my dream job? I think it's fun, because I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home, and I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. Because I do have one daughter, and didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked, but I think I would be better than, say, a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids, that I like doing it always on a part-time basis, but it seems like, boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that, having pretty much worked for most of my life. An apartment never happened, but it sounds something that, to me, would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or a villain? I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert, whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted. But I think when I feel comfortable with certain people, and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be totally confident, or people I might have known for years, either from a personal or business situation. And be more introverted. I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy generally, and I like to use the term reserved. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? What do you do to relax? Oh, wow, that's a great idea. I used to have that on one of my ... I have several computers at home, and that used to be one of my screensavers as well. I usually tend, when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, maybe going surfing or the weather is warm. I don't surf in cold weather anymore. This makes ... It gives me like a brain freeze, even though I've surfed for over 30 years. I usually find exercise helps me relax the best, or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver. I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. That's great. That was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master, though, was my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years, I think I've gotten better at them. I think that's a key thing, and I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more ... I hadn't had those skills earlier. How are you at controlling your temper? I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. I am more likely to think before I speak now, whereas, say, 20 years ago, I was more likely to act before I thought. So I might have said more things that I ... In whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation, but I've never had a violent temper, but I would have a temper where I would fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. I think a lot of that comes ... I think the key word there is maturity. When was the last time you argued with someone and had to get it out? Oh, wow. You know, I was in the 20s. Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Basically, one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different, and I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just ... I don't know if I call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married, does someone have children with them? That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep. I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I'm I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\ntherapy like this instead of with a live human, it'll put all the MFTs out of business. I think it's good sometimes. I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to, if it's someone that might just go by their questions, might judge you or form opinions. If it's a virtual human being, it might be a little less biased also. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly. All right, so I'm going to start up all the recording and then I'm going to actually... I'm trying to slide on some pictures. Sorry, that's in there. Now she is... So now she's going to have a conversation with you. She's going to ask you some questions. When she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to leave you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're all finished. Thank you very much. How do I know... Is she going to say end of session or... Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. Not at all. Sorry about that. I am. I feel pretty good. I'm wide awake. I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee. And I have an easy day today. So I am just going to chat with you. Then I'm going to the gym and run some errands. So I plan on having a nice day today.

That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I'm I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",
         "I generally feel pretty good these days, especially in the last few months. I'm wide awake, have good energy, and enjoy my daily routine. However, like anyone, I've definitely experienced my share of \"periods of blue\" in my life. I've even thought in the past that I might have had some issues, particularly as there's a family history of it.\n\nThese \"blue periods\" were never truly debilitating; I was always able to function and manage my daily life without being completely unable to do things on my own. But I was concerned enough about them, and other life and relationship questions, to seek counseling. A significant factor in my mood is the weather. I've realized I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. When it's sunny and warm, like today, I wake up feeling incredibly happy and content, looking forward to the sun. But when the weather is dark, blue, rainy, and cold, my mood tends to dip.\n\nMy sleep is generally pretty good now, especially if I exercise regularly and don't eat too late. I find that exercise is one of my best coping strategies for relaxing and managing stress – whether it's yoga, a long walk, going to the gym, or surfing in warm water. Sometimes, just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV helps too. I've definitely gotten better at my relaxation skills as I've matured, something I wish I'd mastered earlier in life. I've also learned to control my temper much better, thinking before I speak, which is a big change from my younger days.\n\nInitially, I was quite against therapy, having grown up hearing it was ridiculous or a waste of money. But after trying it, my perspective did a complete 180. I found it incredibly useful. I didn't go because I couldn't function, but rather because I wanted an honest, unbiased opinion from a professional about life and relationships. It's good to talk things out with someone who can bring clarity to a situation without telling you what to think. I prefer someone older with more life experience, and I've found it easier to talk to women about these things. I'm not currently in therapy, as I'm taking a break from it, but I know I have someone I can go to if I need to bounce issues off them again. It's been a useful tool for me to get good ideas and gain perspective from an unbiased source, unlike talking to friends or family who know you too well.\n\nOverall, I'm feeling happier and more content lately, and I'm proud of how I've learned to manage my emotional well-being over the years.",

         " Thank you wanna hunch back in the chat? I just wanted to make this clear. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and we love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. I'm doing okay. That's good. I'm from Greenwich, Connecticut. Yes. I moved here in 2008, so about five years ago. I try to go back at least once a year. Sometimes I go more, sometimes less. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. I'm from the United States. It's less superficial. I moved out here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Initially it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once. But then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally. What did you study at school? Fine arts and photography. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I was interested in photography since high school. I did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments so I decided to pursue art. Are you still working on that? Yes, I have a fine arts degree that I got last year. Awesome. Are you happy to do that? I really enjoy working or interning in forensics. I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography. I feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting. What's one of your most memorable experiences? That's an interesting question. I guess just my childhood in general growing up. Can you tell me about that? Well, my family is very close. My extended family as well and most of them live within the area or in the East Coast in general so we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I consider myself more shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch reality television. I think it's kind of funny and lighthearted. Like what? I watch Bravo TV, the Real Housewives shows and funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm good I guess. I don't really have a temper. If I'm more stressed out, it definitely shows in my attitude but I don't really have anger. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Me and my boyfriend bicker all the time about insignificant things. But other than that, I had an argument with my dad a few days ago. Can you tell me about that? There's been some tension going on since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter. Things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways. So for the 30th time, we were on the phone and he was telling me how I need to call her and I told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend because of the Jewish holidays and he was very immature and telling me, oh forget it, she doesn't want to hear from you now. I could care less because I don't care about having a relationship with her. So if she doesn't want to hear from me, it's easier for me. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I mean, it's been the same recurring argument a lot and I wish that I could. Sometimes I do, but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue. But the thing is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me. So I kind of just lose it and I can't really not say anything. I'm sorry. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Well, I guess the hardest decision I made, which I didn't really realize that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school, where to go to college because for me, I basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own. So it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time. It felt like just like a progression of the next step. But looking back now, that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Well, I wish I could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral, which obviously it wouldn't change anything, but it wasn't seeing her there was not something I'd want to like have in my memory. She was. She was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental. And now, I mean, my parents are great role models just in general. I mean, they're very successful people. So whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people, they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older. Usually it's easy. The problem is staying asleep. No matter how late I go to bed, whether it's 10 p.m. or 4 a.m., I will be up like clockwork by 730 or 8 o'clock in the morning the latest every single day. And I can't seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer. No, I just in the morning, I guess I'm a lighter sleeper, but I just wake up like I just cannot stay asleep anymore, which never used to be a problem this consistent. But now it's I cannot remember the last time I slept past 830 in the morning. I mean, it just makes if I have to do stuff during the day, it makes it a lot more tiring. But it doesn't really I'm so used to it now. It doesn't really change my mood. It's just part of every day. OK, how have you been feeling lately? Um, I don't know. I kind of just feel very. Like so, so just. No extreme highs, no extreme lows. It's kind of one note land. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? I mean, nothing like lately. Like recently, it's just I would say over a period of years, I've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and. Not very outgoing. No. No, I have been diagnosed with anxiety. I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital because I thought it was more serious because I couldn't breathe. But they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety. I think in the right setting and. With the person who's doing it, if they're open minded and the therapist. Is helpful. And good at what they're doing, then yeah. No, I haven't been to therapy since I was a kid. Why did you stop? I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me. But it was never so I mean, we just sat around and talked about my day. It wasn't. I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time, so I didn't really get much out of it. I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Well, I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday. When I'm there, I can always just we save up our money, so it's a complete vacation. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. I just every morning we wake up, we hang out, just enjoy the day. In general? I regret the college I chose to go to. I didn't be from the East Coast. The whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the university does out there are not the same as like the tight knit California school system out here. So when I was researching colleges, I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general college, just like Boston College back home or you know, any other school with the name college at the end of it. I didn't realize until the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school. I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went. So it kind of created more problems for me. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, considering I'm 22, I'd probably say 10 years ago, I would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California. How would your best friend describe you? Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Nice! What would you say are some of your best qualities? I mean, I guess so. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye! Thanks. Okay, I think that's enough. If you'd like to head off to the recording, we'll go over some other things. We will finish up with a poster today about your experience. I can chat with you a little bit more about Ellie and her experience.",

I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me. But it was never so I mean, we just sat around and talked about my day. It wasn't. I didn't feel like I needed therapy at the time, so I didn't really get much out of it. I see what you mean. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Well, I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the New Year's holiday. When I'm there, I can always just we save up our money, so it's a complete vacation. I don't have to worry about paying bills. I don't have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow, who I have to deal with. I just every morning we wake up, we hang out, just enjoy the day. I regret the college I chose to go to. I didn't be from the East Coast. The whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the university does out there are not the same as like the tight knit California school system out here. So when I was researching colleges, I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general college, just like Boston College back home or you know, any other school with the name college at the end of it. I didn't realize until the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school. I didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when I went. So it kind of created more problems for me. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, considering I'm 22, I'd probably say 10 years ago, I would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California. I mean, I guess so. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye! Thanks. Okay, I think that's enough. If you'd like to head off to the recording, we'll go over some other things. We will finish up with a poster today about your experience. I can chat with you a little bit more about Ellie and her experience.",
         "Here's a summary of my experience with depression, from my perspective:\n\nLately, I've been feeling very \"so-so,\" almost like I'm in a \"one note land\" with no extreme highs or lows. It's not a sudden change; over the past few years, I've progressively become more seclusive and reserved, not very outgoing at all.\n\nSleep has become a consistent issue for me. While I usually fall asleep easily, the problem is staying asleep. No matter if I go to bed at 10 PM or 4 AM, I'll be awake like clockwork by 7:30 or 8:00 AM at the latest, every single day. I can't remember the last time I slept past 8:30 AM. This was never a consistent problem before, but now it is. It definitely makes me more tired if I have things to do during the day, but I've gotten so used to it that it doesn't really change my mood anymore; it's just part of my everyday life.\n\nI've also been diagnosed with anxiety. I even had a scary experience with breathing problems that sent me to the hospital, and it turned out to be a physical manifestation of my anxiety. When I'm feeling tense, I sometimes turn on a fish tank screensaver or watch lighthearted reality television, like Bravo shows. They're funny and don't require much attention, which helps me relax.\n\nThere's been some ongoing tension with my dad, especially since I visited over the holidays. We've argued about his girlfriend, and he expects me to make all the effort to build a relationship with her, which I find frustrating. Sometimes I wish I could just bite my tongue, but he says things that are untrue or designed to provoke me, and I just lose it.\n\nLooking back, one of the hardest decisions I made was choosing my college. Moving to California and doing everything on my own felt like a natural progression at the time, but now I regret the college I chose. I didn't realize it was more of a transfer school and not a general college where I could get a bachelor's degree, which created more problems for me. If I could give my younger self advice, I'd tell myself to probably stay closer to home and explore other options instead of being completely invested in moving to California. I also wish I could erase the memory of seeing my grandmother's funeral; it's not something I want to have in my memory.\n\nDespite these things, I do find happiness when I'm back home at my boyfriend's house with his family, especially over the New Year's holiday. When I'm there, it feels like a complete vacation. I don't have to worry about paying bills or what I have to do the next day; we just wake up, hang out, and enjoy the day.",

         " Do I talk? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, is that okay? Okay. It's better. Okay, thanks. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to help you. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions when it's started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Uh, okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles. Really? Yeah. I'm from Los Angeles. Okay. I'm from Los Angeles. Okay. I'm from Los Angeles. Okay. I'm from Los Angeles. Okay. I'm from Los Angeles. Okay. I'm from Los Angeles. Okay. I'm from Los Angeles. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. The variety of environments. The ocean. You know, various different environment or environmental variety. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the superficiality of people. The narcissistic attitude. Just the, it doesn't have a small town sort of feel where, you know, just the warmth, the human sort of warmth interactively. So, yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No. Why? I have a fear of flying and I have, I've developed agoraphobia. I'm sorry. How hard is that? Incredibly difficult. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, I'm guessing you mean the agoraphobia more so than the fear of flying. It's more of a recent development and it's progressing to be worse. It's very, what's the word, immobilizing and very distressing actually. That sounds very hard. Yes, it is. How do you cope with that? How do I cope with that? Just trying to do the best I can and try to, you know, have the most courage I can in the situation and challenge myself in small steps. I read a lot. I do bibliotherapy reading and I try to inform myself of the professional literature so that I could hopefully overcome it someday. That's good. Are you triggered by something? Yes, definitely. Like what? Certain things trigger it like enclosed spaces, being in a car, traveling, being away from home, being in someone else's car, things that are outside of my locus of control. What do you study at school? Actually, I don't go to school right now. What's your dream job? My dream job is to be a psychologist. Awesome. What made you decide to do that? I'm not a psychologist, but what would make me decide to do that is having lived through some challenges like this, having lived through some traumas. But I've always had an interest in it since junior high of I'm very interested in people and human interaction and human connection and the bitterment of those things. Bridging people together and helping people enter personally through their personal challenges. So that's sort of it in a nutshell. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm someone who's, I can be very outgoing and sort of a warm and friendly presence very easily, but I think on the exterior, but I think I'm shy and I challenge it to do that. I think at heart I'm shy, but I challenge myself completely because I do love human interaction, so I take those risks and those challenges. When was the last time that happened? The last time I interacted with somebody was today. If I think I'm understanding your question correctly. Oh no, no, I think I'm misunderstanding your question, but I interacted with Rachel. I just, I'm continuously interacting with people, taking those risks. I see what you mean. How are you at controlling your own life? Very good. When was the last time you argued with someone? When was the last time I argued with somebody? I actually can't remember. It wasn't recent. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I have to think about that. I don't know yet. Let me think. I'm drawing a blank. I can only remember things from when I was like 21 right now. I can't think of anything contemporary right now. My mind is... Okay. When I was younger. Can you tell me about that? Yes. I lost a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousins. Because when I was 21, I'm 45. I had a disagreement with my aunt and I said something that was critical of her. She threw me out of their home and let me back. I apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives and changed their minds. I regret that. I'm assuming you mean how did I feel when they asked me to never be in their lives again and to leave? I was shattered. Soul shattered. Heart shattered. Tell me about your relationship with your family. That was my family. That was the good side of my family. They were the loving aspect of my family. The rest of my family is very cruel and very abusive. How close are you to your family? I don't have any relationship with my family at all. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I wish I could get that away from my memory. Can you tell me more about that? Yeah. I was injured in the emergency room. I went in for food poisoning. I was ordered to go in by a doctor. I had collapsed and I was ordered to go into the ER for food poisoning. I came out injured with a neurological syndrome. I was injured with an intravenous procedure. Now I have RSD, Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. The scene in the emergency room was an out of control scene. There was a problem with the procedure. The doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake. It was extremely excruciating. It was a crisis. Every time I think about the injury and it was disfiguring, I got disabled permanently from it. I was also disabled from my employment for quite a given amount of time as well. I have residual physical trauma from it and disfigurement. Severe disability limited functionality with my right hand and arm. Thank you. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I don't even know what that is. I apologize because I can't really give you the most suitable answer. I'm guessing it had something to do with my cat and her urgent, what do you call it, she was in intensive care, veterinary care, and I'm sure it had something to do with that. Other than that, I would say I had to choose my life path, whether I was admitted to that program or whether I was going to go to art school for four years and I had to pick a life direction. That's not a traumatic situation. I don't know how best to answer your question. I can't. I have severe nightmares and I have nocturnal panic attacks. And I also have physical illness on top of it and I'm in excruciating pain. Yes. Can you tell me about that? Yes. They're triggered by the injury that I told you. They're triggered by my family, how they've treated me, what they've said to me, what they've done to me. They're triggered by my physical illness, not my injury only, but my physical illness as well. So yes. What do you feel like when you die state-well? I feel very ill and feel so fatigued. How have you been feeling lately? Very ill and very fatigued. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior and thoughts lately? When I don't sleep and get enough sleep, my anxiety level I believe is up and I'm susceptible to feeling distressed. So yeah. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Three years ago, my most recent diagnosis and in 2001 as well. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Three years ago and when I was 20 years old. What got you to sleep? My background, my childhood from my family of origin and the abuse that I went through and their ultimate rejection of me and estrangement. That was the first reason. Do you still have a therapy now? No, I stopped six months ago. Why did you stop? Why did I stop? I'm just taking a break. I'm going to continue. Okay. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Yes, very much. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It's helped tremendously. What sort of changes have been noticed since you've been doing therapy? I think it helps with anxiety. It helps inspire, create inspiration. It helps feeling connected. It helps to create what I ultimately, my goal is to give myself a voice and it helps to, it's part of that process. It also helps to understand myself, to learn about myself. There's just so many benefits. I'll stop right there. There's many more. That's good. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy was a really long time ago. It was before my illness and it was in 1997. The onset of my illness was in July of 1997, so it was before that. Can you tell me about that? Yes. I was in a very good place in terms of my career, in terms of just my relationships. Everything was just sort of at its best. Career, relationships, personal fulfillment as well. I was very active and doing very many things that were meaningful to build a life. I was in the process of just in the planning stages of my life, but also very accomplished at the same time. Things were just going very well and I just really liked just where my life was at. It was just in a really good place in many ways. What are some things in which you could change about yourself? I wish I could change about myself my anxiety. I wish I could change about myself my agoraphobia, my PTSD, meaning my trauma, and what else? My insecurity as far as just with other people in the sense that I'm always trying to make sure that I don't do something that... Hold on one second. I'm just trying to make sure that I don't do anything that's offensive to them or insults them or is disrespectful. I feel like I'm overly cautious about that. It kind of becomes an anxiety unto itself. I definitely think that that would be beneficial to change. The other thing I'd like to change about myself is I wish I could feel... Also depression, I'd like to change that about myself. I wish I could feel better. I wish I didn't have the burden that I do of my family of not having one. What else? I wish I didn't have my illness and the physical excruciating pain that I'm in. I wish I didn't have the symptoms of PTSD. That definitely affects one's complete life. I wish I was more articulate, and I wish I was someone who was well-spoken and someone who was well-written. There's many more things that I wish I could change about myself to improve myself. So, many more. I'm not sure. Maybe to not be so trusting. I trusted some medical professionals that, again, created the injury. There's an expectation and a demand to just blindly trust the medical profession. Don't ask questions. Not to trust your own self, your own instincts or intuition. I would have told myself to be a little more careful, I guess, if that's useful to your question. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. What did I really enjoy? I can't think of anything specific, but I know it would have to do with either reading or connecting with someone on a meaningful level. I'm most proud of my compassion, my empathy and caring about people. I'm proud of it anyways, but also particularly, I come from an environment that's the opposite, a background, and I wasn't taught that. But I really do care about people, and I guess I'm most proud of that. I'm also proud of my career accomplishments and my tenacity, my fierce tenacity to succeed. Also to get the strength it takes to get through the injury, to live with it, and to live with the illness that I live with, the physical illness. So I think that would be it. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Okay, I've been crying and opening up to this person, so I think I did what you wanted, right? I'm embarrassed because I got really involved. She was asking questions that were really at the heart of some of your pain, and I was honest about it. So yes, it's embarrassing. I'm sure the video is like, oh my gosh, this person. I'm sure this is what you're hoping that someone can genuinely interact with someone. Okay, cool. Okay, okay. Oh, thank you. Yeah. I didn't know I'd need.",

         "I've been diagnosed with depression, first when I was 20 years old, and then again more recently, about three years ago. It feels like a very long time since I truly felt happy; the last time was before my illness started in 1997, when everything was just going very well with my career, relationships, and personal fulfillment.\n\nLately, I often feel very ill and fatigued, which really impacts my energy levels. When I don't get enough sleep, my anxiety goes up, and I become susceptible to feeling distressed. Sleep is a big challenge for me, as I suffer from severe nightmares and nocturnal panic attacks, which are often triggered by the trauma of my injury, my family's treatment of me, and my ongoing physical illness.\n\nMy depression, along with my PTSD (which was diagnosed three years ago and back in 2001), is deeply rooted in my childhood. The abuse I experienced from my family of origin, their ultimate rejection, and estrangement were the initial reasons I sought help. That loss of family was soul-shattering, heart-shattering.\n\nBeyond that, a significant injury I sustained in the emergency room – where I developed Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy (RSD) – has left me permanently disabled, disfigured, and in excruciating physical pain. This physical illness, along with the trauma of the event itself, is a constant burden that significantly impacts my life and contributes to my struggles. I was also disabled from my employment for a significant period.\n\nOn top of everything, I've developed agoraphobia more recently, and it's getting worse. It's incredibly immobilizing and distressing. Things like enclosed spaces, being in a car, traveling, or being away from home, especially in someone else's car, are huge triggers because they're outside my locus of control. I try to cope by taking small steps, challenging myself, and reading a lot, including professional literature, hoping to overcome it someday.\n\nSocially, I find myself at heart quite shy, even though I can present as outgoing and warm. I push myself to interact with people because I truly love human connection, but I'm also overly cautious, constantly anxious about saying or doing something offensive or disrespectful. I wish I could change that insecurity, along with my anxiety, agoraphobia, PTSD, and of course, the depression itself. I also wish I didn't have the burden of not having a family or the constant physical pain from my illness.\n\nI stopped therapy about six months ago, just taking a break, but I plan to continue. I find it incredibly useful; it's helped tremendously with my anxiety, inspiring me, helping me feel connected, and giving me a voice. It's also been crucial for understanding and learning about myself.\n\nDespite all these challenges, I'm proud of my compassion, empathy, and caring for people, especially coming from a background that didn't teach me that. I'm also proud of my tenacity and the strength it takes to live with my injury and chronic illness every day. While I can't recall a specific recent moment of enjoyment, I know it would involve reading or a meaningful connection with someone.",

         " Okay. Recording started. Beep, beep. So now I'm going to pull up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll say goodbye, and I will put the doorbell over here so you can let me know when you're done, okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions from the start. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Born downtown Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I love LA. I love the traffic on the 405. I love the beach. I live near the beach. I love...there's so much to do here. I just love...and I love the weather. I love it here. That's great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Nothing. Okay. Do you travel a lot? A little bit. What do you enjoy about traveling? I guess visiting family and destinations. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I last flew to Cedar Rapids to visit a friend, and was there for a couple weeks, and I'm flying back February 11th to see him again. He's an old friend. Thanks. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No. Why? I'm pretty outgoing. I talk to people. I enjoy talking to people. I talk to people at the airport. What do you do to relax? I garden a little bit. I read a little bit. I watch TV. I'm a basketball fan. I go to the beach when the weather is nice. I go to the pool. Okay. What are some things that make you a little mad? Annoying people, rude people, people that drive. They just have no consideration for others. What do you do when you're annoyed? I swear a lot. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, I'm all right. I get mad once in a while. When was the last time you argued with someone? It was probably my daughter. She's 21, almost 22. She lives at college, but comes home on the weekends, and her room was probably a mess. It's the same fight we've been having for years. Uh-oh. That's not good. Yeah, it does. It's better now that we don't live together all the time, though. That's good. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? I guess making the right decisions. It started out when she was little about education, the right school to go to, the right activities to do, setting a good example, being a good role model. What's the best thing about being a parent? Oh, everything. My kids are the greatest joy of my life. I love them so much. And you just get so enriched and fulfilled by them. And when the kids are little, you see things through their eyes, which is exciting. You want to share everything with them. That's so good to hear. Tell me about your kids. I have an older son who's a financial analyst, and then I have a daughter in college. She's a liberal studies major. She's going to be a teacher. Cool. What did you study at school? A business. Are you still working at that? Yes. What do you do now? I'm an office manager. What's your dream job? My dream job? Wow, that's hard. I don't know. I like my job. It's good. I like the people. I enjoy it. It's fun. Good. What do you think of the names of the kids? My son told me they're called the teacup generation because they're fragile. And I think their pain's in the ass, as most of them. Yeah. I see what you mean. Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Not for a while. Maybe a month ago. Can you tell me about that? I have a new boyfriend, and things were going really great, and now they're just going. It was great, and now it's just okay. I guess the newness wore off. How hard is that? It's hard. It's hard. How do you know them? I'm sorry? How do you know them? How do I know them? I don't know what you mean by them. Let's come back to that later. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I don't know. A year or so. What got you to this point? I just didn't feel well. I just couldn't. I just didn't feel right. I couldn't pull myself out of it. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? Oh, just sad and just lack of energy and didn't really, wasn't really motivated, didn't really, wasn't really my happy self. Do you feel like there's a useful? Therapy? Yes. Do you still get a therapy now? I do. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? Well, not that many changes. I still don't feel that great, but I just, it's good to talk to someone and tell them how you feel. Yeah. Even if it's just to get something off your chest. How have you been feeling lately? Tired, sad, depressed, blue. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I'm just not happy. I don't feel good and I'm not happy. How do you cope with that? I don't just stay to myself, don't go out with friends as much as I used to. That sounds really hard. It's very hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Terrible. I don't sleep. I'm sorry. Thank you. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Crazy, distracted. It's hard for me to cope with things. Easy, mundane things are just difficult. I see what you mean. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Well, being around my kids is fun. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? My son and daughter-in-law and my daughter and I went out to have Hawaiian food. We got together. It's always fun to get together. We got together at my house on Christmas. I enjoyed just getting together with them. Awesome. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'll take better care of my health, I guess. Have you done anything to avoid it? I don't know. I don't know. Okay. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my daughter's pretty positive and upbeat. My parents, they're both gone, but they were pretty positive. What's on your mind when you're most memorable experience? I suppose going on a trip to Canada with my daughter was very memorable. Can you tell me about that? We flew to Detroit, where I have my best friend lives there. We stayed with her. We drove from Detroit through Canada, Niagara Falls. We went to Buffalo, where she's from. She has three girls. My daughter was, I think, third or fourth grade, something like that. It was just fun for all of us to get together and do things. That sounds like a great situation. What would your best friend describe you? Exactly like her. We're outgoing. We're outspoken. We tell it like it is. We're high-energy people. We have a lot of anxiety. We like to do a lot of the same things. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. About three or four weeks ago. Tell me more about that. Well, I say that my feeling is attributed to weather. I don't like cold weather, and I'm not comfortable at all in it. Whenever the weather changes, I sort of get down. What would you say if somebody asked about you? Well, I'm funny. I'm hardworking. I care about everyone. I'm a very kind, compassionate person. I have sympathy for everyone. I'll reach out to someone that I see in a store or anywhere that needs my help. That's good. What are you most proud of in your life? I suppose raising my kids and the good people they've turned out to be. That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye.",

         "I was diagnosed with depression about a year ago. What got me to that point was just not feeling well; I couldn't pull myself out of it, and I just didn't feel right. My symptoms included feeling sad, having a general lack of energy, and not feeling motivated. I just wasn't my happy self.\n\nLately, I've been feeling tired, sad, depressed, and blue. I'm just not happy and I don't feel good. This has really impacted my daily life. I tend to stay to myself and don't go out with friends as much as I used to. It's been very hard. Sleep is also a big struggle for me; I don't sleep well at all. When I don't sleep, I feel crazy and distracted, and it makes it hard for me to cope with things – even easy, mundane tasks become difficult.\n\nI've been in therapy since my diagnosis, and I still go. While I haven't noticed many changes in how I feel, and I still don't feel great, it is good to talk to someone and get things off my chest.\n\nMy mood can also be affected by external factors. I don't like cold weather, and I'm not comfortable in it at all, so whenever the weather changes, I tend to get down. Also, recently, I felt really happy about a month or so ago because of a new boyfriend, but now things are just \"okay,\" and I guess the newness wore off, which has contributed to my current feelings.\n\nDespite these challenges, being around my kids is always fun and puts me in a good mood. Recently, going out for Hawaiian food with my son, daughter-in-law, and daughter, and getting together with them at my house for Christmas, were things I really enjoyed. My kids are a great source of joy for me.",

Just one spot, sorry. Okay, great. One last thing. Perfect. So again, she'll let you know when she's done. I'm going to hand you the doorbell, but I'll try to keep an eye on the time as well. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay. Where are you from originally? I was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA? Originally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA is very has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just sort of I don't know if estranged is the right word but I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. How hard is that? It's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy. So it doesn't really answer your question but Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tape and I'm not sure what I'm doing. I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? I have certain I do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really it soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed. When was the last time that happened? A few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing. How did you decide to do that? I've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me. How hard is that? It's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good. I see what you mean. How are you at controlling your temper? Good. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. What's something you feel guilty about? A lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really really that I really wanted to work and I I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and not and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty that was pretty tough. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Well some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were. I think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself. I mean it's it's possible I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Well it's it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. That's good. How do you cope with them? Um well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using I'm the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet. Are they triggered by something? They're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to to this. It's really it's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't I don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like I would I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep. I don't know. I get up, I toss and turn all night. You know and now it's just it's yeah I don't sleep too great right now. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad. Okay. How long ago were you diagnosed? I think three, three, four years ago. It was when I I had been given taken stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So yeah that was kind of a turning point. But unfortunately it happened after everything went bad. So How did you feel in that moment? In the moment I don't know. I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm that I had that I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain and I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now What got you to say help? What got you to say help? What got you to say help? Um Um There really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either I was I was self-medicating I was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but It was at least that and not firing me. But but but yeah but so I got help but it was. But it wasn't soon enough. Not not as much as I should. I go to a couple of meetings. I go to I go to a so that I can. You know keep control of that aspect to to and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately you know being unemployed my employment ran out you know I'm I'm you know I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. Somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. And then there's you. Right. Well like I said I mean. Just the talk I mean that let's just take the A.A. for example because that's probably the closest closest for them seeing with therapy right now. Just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can do. Something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. You know better than I that I have been. I mean. It's sort of it has its ups and downs. You know I'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just I have to deal with real life which is. It has its own challenge. Yeah. Yeah. It can be tough to find a good job. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um. It was probably you know a couple of years ago. Um. I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. Is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree. And we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and. I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and. Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So. What are you most proud of? Probably the. Probably this. Educate educational series I did. Educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about. And about the world around them so that I feel like that was a really good thing to do. The world. my job. It was a, we were trying to come up with new ideas for, because we would put together videos and stuff to give to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot to it so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend? I don't know. I don't know, it's been a while since I've really thought about that. I don't know, would I go somewhere? Would I? I don't know. Thank you. Howdy. Thank you.",
         "Are there any parameters? I mean, should I just talk naturally or just however I'm comfortable? Whatever you're comfortable, just talk naturally. I'm going to go ahead and just fix this. Just one spot, sorry. Okay, great. One last thing. Perfect. So again, she'll let you know when she's done. I'm going to hand you the doorbell, but I'll try to keep an eye on the time as well. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay. Where are you from originally? I was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA? Originally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to move back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living in LA has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just sort of I don't know if estranged is the right word but I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. How hard is that? It's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends, I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy. So it doesn't really answer your question but Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tape and I'm not sure what I'm doing. I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? I do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really it soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed. When was the last time that happened? A few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing. How did you decide to do that? I've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to really hit me. How hard is that? It's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good. I see what you mean. How are you at controlling your temper? Good. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. What's something you feel guilty about? A lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really wanted to work and I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and not and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty tough. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Well some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have been, it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were. I think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself. I mean it's possible I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Well it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by drinking and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's been better. That's good. How do you cope with them? Um well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet. Are they triggered by something? They're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to this. It's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't I don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's like if I do that I still don't get enough sleep. I don't know. I get up, I toss and turn all night. You know and now it's just yeah I don't sleep too great right now. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I don't know. It's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad. Okay. How long ago were you diagnosed? I think three, four years ago. It was when I had been given taken stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So yeah that was kind of a turning point. But unfortunately it happened after everything went bad. So How did you feel in that moment? In the moment I don't know. I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean I was paying a lot of money to go see doctors and they were doing they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm like thanks guys for helping but it's a little late now What got you to say help? Um There really wasn't any choice I had to I was a mess. It was either I was self-medicating I was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but It was at least that and not firing me. But yeah, so I got help but it wasn't soon enough. Not as much as I should. I go to a couple of meetings. I go to a so that I can. You know keep control of that aspect to and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately you know being unemployed my employment ran out you know I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year.

         "Here is a summary of my experience with depression, in my own words:\n\nRight now, I'm feeling a bit pensive, a little down, but generally okay. My depression really weighs on me. I moved to LA after losing my job back East, and that whole experience made me feel like a failure. I'm still struggling to get back on my feet, and I miss my old life, my friends, and the relationships I had. It's hard not speaking to my family or old friends much anymore.\n\nA big part of what weighs on me is the immense guilt I feel about a past relationship that ended badly. I really wanted it to work, but I was getting more and more messed up because I wasn't on the right medication. Everything just spiraled out of control, and I feel so guilty about how it ended, making her tell me she never wanted to see me again. Logically, I know it wasn't all my fault, especially with the chemical imbalances in my brain, but I still dwell on it constantly.\n\nI take little things and just think about them endlessly until it drives me crazy. Any small detail can throw off my whole day. I even feel uncomfortable and ashamed about things I did in high school, years ago. These thoughts are triggered by everything – a name, a place, anything can connect back to something difficult. I really don't get a break from it.\n\nTo cope, I try to keep my mind completely occupied. If I'm watching TV, I'm playing a game on my phone; if I'm on the computer, I have a show playing in another window. I wish I could just let the thoughts come and deal with them, but I can't yet. Writing helps a lot though. When I can really get into a novel I'm working on, with my music, it soothes me and I feel relaxed, like I'm accomplishing something. That's when I feel most relaxed.\n\nSleep is a real challenge. I'm a very light sleeper, constantly awake and asleep. I used to stay up until I was exhausted just to conk out, but now even that doesn't work. I toss and turn all night and don't get enough sleep, which just makes me feel bad.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression about three or four years ago, after years of being treated for anxiety. It was a turning point when a psychiatrist finally sat down with me and realized the medication wasn't working. Now, I'm on medication that helps; I still get upset and depressed, but I don't completely lose it for days at a time like I used to. It makes me angry, though, that I lost everything – my job, my relationships – because of chemicals in my brain and because the doctors I was paying weren't helping me sooner. I had to get help because I was a complete mess, self-medicating with alcohol, and it was affecting my work. I was even institutionalized once or twice. Even though I got help, it wasn't soon enough to save my job.\n\nNow, I go to AA meetings, which helps me talk things out and get stuff out of my head. Just saying things out loud, making sense of the mess in my brain, is a huge step. I also have a psychiatrist for my medication, but I only see her a few times a year because of my unemployment. The chemical part of my depression feels like it's getting under control, but now I'm dealing with the 'real-world problems' of being unemployed, applying for jobs daily without any success. It's hard.\n\nThe last time I felt truly happy was a couple of years ago, when things were going well at my job and I was in a good relationship. We were picking out a Christmas tree, and for that instant, I felt like a normal person, doing a normal thing. It was a glimpse of what normal people feel. What makes it so hard now is the fear that I don't know if I'll ever feel that way again.",

and go ahead and go ahead and go ahead to help me you know try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue to provide for them comfortably. What did you study at school? I studied communications actually. I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now I'm studying business. What made you decide to do that? I just thought that you know there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs and then I have a desire to go to graduate school so I just figured in the long run it would put me in a better position, give me more opportunities with the communications. It's a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of TV reporting and things like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so I just thought I would go into something more realistic and you know but I like both fields. I really do. I like communicating, writing, reading, talking as you can tell and so we'll see. What's your dream job? A couple probably but I would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer, going to different destinations, trying different foods out, writing about different people, cultures, learning and living you know about those different people and cultures living amongst the people there and being interactive with the children and stuff like that so I kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something along those lines and then the fallback would be a counselor, social worker, something in that area. If I could encompass all three hopefully I can. I would like to do that. That's actually a hard question probably because I initially grew up very shy and I'm not so much shy as I am reserved now but not conservative but just reserved and you know when I go somewhere I'm checking everything, everybody else out and then once I become comfortable or acclimate to a situation then I'm like okay you know I warm up to the situation or the people but I'm also friendly. I can be very friendly and outgoing. I like to talk. You know I seem like a chatterbox but I'm not really so usually if I'm in a big space with a whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention. I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but overall I am an open friendly person. For me it could be something as simple as just unplugging everything, all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating, praying or reading a good spiritual scripture. If I'm able to I like to go for a good massage, maybe get a facial, you know things that will I kind of like the physical part of it. I like massages, things that really release tension. And if not then just like I said just sitting at home reading and praying or I like the beach. I love the beach so sometimes I drive and go sit by the beach. I also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself or get a mani-pedi or maybe go window shopping. You know things like that. Pretty good. Sometimes I'm just like I don't really have so much issue with the temper as I am. I just I'm more impatient. Unfortunately a lot of times with people and you know situations so I just can become really irritated or irritable, quite agitated especially if it's that time of the month for me and just lose patience. Outside of that I'm actually pretty good. I try to be very conscious of where I'm at and be very patient with people especially if I can see that the person is like if they're a new checkout person at the counter or cashier I do try to be patient and understanding because I would want that you know if it were me I would want someone to extend that to me. You know with my kids sometimes you know it works both ways too. If it's that time of the month I'm just like just leave me alone or I might have a short temper or a short fuse. So I am conscious of it. I try to be aware of it and try to monitor it but you know like anybody I'm human in their times or I have my days or moments when I could just like go off and just lose it. What was the last time you argued with someone? Um well I haven't really had it not per se an argument but there's been an ongoing thing with American Express. So I would say because it was not a personal contact but a company I we it really was an argument but you know I had some issues with American Express I had to call in about on I think Saturday and I kept I wasn't getting the response I expected and so I would the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and I was upset and you know the rep was trying to over talk me and then I was trying to over talk her. So you know I don't know if you would consider that an argument but I would definitely say that's the last time when you know I just kind of like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning. That one didn't really escalate to an argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Probably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express. Actually it was on Sunday. Yeah and I know the person was trying to help me but you know when you're constantly being told different things and I've had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved. It just takes you there. So just I kept raising my voice said some things I shouldn't have and just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact. I like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there. My blood pressure was raised. Excuse me. And that was just a kind of a mess for a while for like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that. Just irritable and agitated and upset. And so I always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how I could you know handle things differently. But that's one I definitely wish I could have kept my cool and been more level headed and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. Well I probably have had a couple but probably the most is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they probably my twins they were probably about two and I was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time. And he pretty much you know was not comfortable with me having another child at the time. And I wasn't comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby. But he put me under so much stress and you know kind of I want to say really pushed me into having terminating the pregnancy. And that's always stayed with me and I've always missed that pregnancy that child I think about that that baby or what could have been. I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody about it. But I know deep down I secretly if I had it to do all over again I would have just I would have kept the baby and move forward. So that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally. I could deal with a lot and I have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know a lot of financial problems. But that to me was the hardest. Thank you. No. No. How have you been feeling lately? Okay you know I was laid off in December so I've been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet. So that's been a little tough. I've had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school. So my range of emotions have just have been just that a range and a very good friend of mine now who we both started off you know in the same place about five years ago. Well she's been able to move forward and going with her life and now she's graduating in next month from USC with her master's in social work. So I'm feeling a little envious of that and I have been for like the past year but more so recently although I'm very very happy for her you know and she's a good person and she deserves it. But you know of course you've done a lot of what she was me so that too has kind of been bothering me. Hi Ms. Lola. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Well I'm really good with people. I communicate well. I like to talk. I'm really good with children. That's why I would like to teach or be a counselor. Although I have not really tapped into it I know I'm a very creative person. I know I write pretty good. I could possibly be a creative writer but I know I'm very creative. So if given the opportunity I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills. Something like with maybe songwriting, fiction writing, probably like interior decorating. Anything artistic. Just anything because I love music. I love the arts. I love drama. I love plays. I'm not a big fashion buff but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that. So I think those are my strong points as well as just getting along with people. I know I will make a great counselor. My friends come to me all the time. I have a good ear for listening. I'm a great mediator and I know how to because I've been through a lot. One of my friends called me the voice of reason. The one that's actually graduating from SC. I know I'm light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to insight and wisdom. I don't know if it has to do with having older parents myself or how I grew up. I had very traditional southern parents who instilled a lot of great values in me. Or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign, I'm a Pisces. I'm really good with people. Just period. Like I said, I have my moments but I know if it's something I could go into and develop, I would do well. Is there anything you regret? Not really. Some of the situations. I wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children. Picked a different partner. I say that because my son's father is great. A great father for my kids but not so much as a partner for me. We're not together. I'm just saying overall. I think I would say, if I could let me backtrack that, not finishing school when I should have. Not following my dreams and goals and doing things as I was planning initially. I think that would be the one thing I could say I regret. Not following my goals and finishing school on time and pursuing what I really wanted to do. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay focused and finish school. Pick a career path and stay on that. Stay motivated and don't let anything or anybody deter you. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm pretty stable and consistent. Overall, how I face adversity. How I face things. I'm a pretty committed person. If I say I'm going to do something, I try to stick to it. I'm a very loyal friend. I've done a pretty good job with raising my kids. So long. Great. Thank you. Bye bye. .",

         "Here is a summary of my experience with depression:\n\nIt's like a heavy cloud has settled over me, a constant sadness that's there even when there's no clear reason for it. Alongside that, there's this profound sense of hopelessness, a feeling that things will never truly get better. A lot of guilt comes with it too, especially about not being able to 'snap out of it' or feeling like I'm burdening my family. Sometimes I get really irritable, snapping at people I care about, which just piles on more guilt. Other times, I just feel numb, like I'm going through the motions without really feeling anything at all.\n\nThis isn't a new feeling for me; I've had episodes like this on and off since my early twenties, but this current one has been consistent for about six months now. It often gets worse during stressful times, like after a big work project or a personal setback, like my breakup last year.\n\nMy daily life is significantly impacted. My sleep is a mess – either I can't fall asleep at all, or I'm sleeping 12-14 hours and still waking up exhausted. My appetite is all over the place; some days I barely eat, others I'm constantly craving comfort food, especially sweets, which has led to significant weight fluctuations. I've become very isolated, cancelling plans and avoiding calls because it feels like too much effort to pretend to be okay. Even being around friends feels draining.\n\nMotivation is at zero. Getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain, and things I used to love, like hiking or reading, just don't interest me anymore. Even simple tasks like showering or doing dishes feel monumental. It's really impacting my work performance; I miss deadlines and can't concentrate, and my boss has definitely noticed. I also experience a lot of fatigue, even after sleeping a lot, and sometimes physical aches like headaches or stomach issues without a clear medical cause.\n\nWhen I try to cope, I often just curl up in bed and cry, or try to distract myself with TV, but that's more avoiding than coping. I've tried mindfulness apps, but it's hard to stick with them when I feel so low. My family is supportive, but I feel bad burdening them, and I tend to push my partner away even though they try to help. I haven't really opened up to friends about the depth of what I'm going through. I finally decided to seek help because it's affecting my job and relationships too much, and I'm just tired of feeling this way.",

         " Okay, that looks good. Okay, when she says goodbye, we're just going to press this button and I'll come back over. Okay? So she'll start asking questions after. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good, I guess. That's good. Where are you from originally? Really? When did you move to LA? How often do you go back to your hometown? Why? Okay. Why did you move to LA? Well, I guess you're not programmed with this knowledge, but Katrina happened in 2005. Wow. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Not really. Want to tell me about that? Um... Where to begin? Uh, just LA is different culturally. I have a different culture out here. It's just a different place. Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? Um, it's bike-friendly. Louisiana isn't. New Orleans, for that matter, really isn't. Now they're trying to be, but it just isn't that successful. What are some things you know about LA? The drivers. They're crazy. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really, kind of, but not much anymore. Why? I don't have the money. Kind of broke. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just being able to go on an adventure. I'd love to hear about all your trips. Um, let's see. I once went to Comic-Con on a bicycle, like a three-wheel bike. Um, and that was pretty fun. Kind of scary and dangerous. Nearly got killed. It was scary. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Traveling or just in general. Whatever comes to your mind. Hmm. Um, I gotta say... I gotta say we were heading out of, um... We were heading off the PCH and going into Laguna. And Laguna has this really steep hill and on Sundays it's full of traffic. And I remember going down the hill and my brakes weren't working. And I was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just wouldn't click. And I was like, oh god. And I'm on a three-wheel bike so I'm larger than most bikes. And I'm like zipping in between gridlock traffic. Going down a hill, unable to brake. And I'm going down and suddenly there's this car that veers right into... Essentially where I'm trying to go. So I turn sharply in front of... Between this bus and this truck. And literally end up going sideways through traffic, through oncoming traffic. And then looping back through oncoming traffic, back into the right traffic. Still without any brakes. And not managing to keep my bike from rolling, which is painful when your bike rolls. It kind of hurts. A lot. So, yeah. Yeah, that's it. Various different things. Anthropology, visual effects. Kind of weird, but yeah. I've always had a fascination with film. And I think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating. Just as like the mob mentality of people. Yeah. You're a dream job. Okay. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? Why? You know, I've never been afraid of what people think of me. Like people I don't know. I'm not afraid of what they think. I'm more concerned with the people I know and what they think of me. I guess. So being outgoing just doesn't really affect me. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? That's fine. How are you at controlling your temper? Not good. Does that often happen to you, sometimes? Frequently. Can you tell me about that? Um. Uh. In high school, I shoved somebody's head through a locker. Um. Yeah. Yeah, that's not good. Don't ever shove someone's head into a locker. That's a great way to get suspended. Um. I don't know. Yeah, things like that. Just getting into fights. Um. Like a serious argument? What are the things you like? Um. Chhh. Uh. I guess? Like. This argument over. Over. Um. I guess over like, uh, like viewpoints on like gun control and gun control laws. I mean. I was like. Yesterday evening. How did you feel about that? It was. It was an argument about, you know, gun control regulation. I mean, it doesn't really affect me personally. But that was like the last argument I got into. That's kind of what you specified, I think. Okay. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would have in a different room. Ooh. I don't know. Ooh. Um. Uh, my entire life? Um. Ha ha. Uh. Ah. Um. About two years ago. I broke up with. With. Like. As everyone calls her my evil ex. And um. Yeah. It was just. It was bad. The whole, the whole thing went down bad. I mean. Uh. Uh. I think I've calmed down a lot since then. Like just as a person as a whole. But. I mean. I was angry and stuff. I think I like went riding my bike for like. Hundreds plus miles in a singular day. And I was in a ton of pain. Like. Later in the evening I got home I was like oh god. Like I could barely walk. Um. And yeah. I think running off and. Like going on like extreme cycling spree was not good. But it was better than like. Eating too much and like. Just. Over eating because I was depressed. But yeah. Like we. We fought and screamed and it was. It was not good. Like we didn't physically fight. It was more like a screaming match of death. Hmm. Um. I don't think I've had a singular hard decision. I've ever had to make. Because. My my biggest thing. In life. Is. Don't. You know don't regret. Don't regret. The the things you do. Just regret the odds. Just regret the opportunities you've missed. And that's like had to come with me. That's like had to. I've had to like learn that in the past like two years. Like two years ago I totally just could not grasp that concept. And to answer your question. I think thinking about it. The hardest decision I've had to make. Is. I'd say. Probably. Probably. Probably to break up with my ex. Probably. Um. Ooh. Um. Where do I begin? Um. My ex was not a good person. Just in any way shape or form of the word. Um. She did some things that I wasn't entirely comfortable with. Um. Just to the people around her and to me. Um. I was just. I was just. I was just. I was just. I was just. To the people around her and to me. And. I. You know. They say you're supposed to forgive people. For making mistakes. Or doing things. And I just I think there's some things you can't forgive people for. No matter how hard you try. And I think there's some things that once done. They can't be undone. They just. They're the way that they are. And I think. I think after what she did. I like I just. Things just fell apart after that. It just. We. Despite us trying. It just it didn't work out. I mean. I don't know. I don't really want to talk about exactly what happened. Okay. Tell me about an event or something that you or she erased from your memory. Oh geez. Oh man. I don't know. Erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening. Huh. I don't. You know that's hard. Katrina. Just the experience of Katrina for starters. My ex. I guess between those two. It's kind of hard. I'd actually rather lean towards Katrina. Because that was just that. That was not. I mean I guess you don't exactly know about it but. In 2005. This giant storm hit. New Orleans Louisiana. Killed a whole bunch of people. Leveled the town. And. I lost a lot of friends during the storm. I mean I'm kind of. I'm getting over it. But. It's still. It's still there. And I think. I don't know. I mean. You can try and look at. You can try your best to try and find something positive. In that. But there's just there's nothing. The only. Thing. You can do. Is. Just think that was like a freak accident and it will never happen again. So. I live in LA and you know. Earthquakes. They could happen. I just think. Rather. Rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming. Yes. Yeah. Depression it's reoccurred multiple times. That's no surprise. First time I was diagnosed was in middle school. Which would have been. Ten. Well ten between ten twelve years ago. I don't know. I don't know whenever I was in the sixth grade. That's. That's why first was. Told that I was depressed. As far as PTSD goes. Post Katrina. And then. You know. Post Katrina mostly. That was the big thing. I guess having been diagnosed. Previously as being depressed and still being in high school. It kind of wasn't I wasn't really seeking help. It's kind of. I got I kind of got into my high school. And they were like. Here's help. Because we know you're going to need it. And I was like oh well thanks. I didn't really ask for it but okay I'll take it. You know. Just kind of happened. No not not anymore. That's a good question. Geez. You know I really don't know. I guess it just kind of stopped. Just kind of was like. I'm not going to do this anymore. Sometimes. Sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today. And stuff. And. You know. It's kind of well I'm feeling fine right now. But. Ask me in two hours and who knows. You know. I guess. It's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen. And to just get on and move along with your life. Essentially just like carry on you know. Things will happen carry on. Wow. I was. I was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well for starters I mean you can't see when I walked in but I'm walking with a cane right now because I got hit by a car recently. And I'd make my leg better. Let's see canes over there that way. But anyway. I don't know. Make myself less fat. I'd make it so I don't feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day. Because when you sleep like more than 10 hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time. Like I have friends who are like oh you know I feel rejuvenated after six hours. And I'm like how do you do that? I have to sleep like 12 hours to feel good. Like you can sleep six. You know. Like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four. I have to get away with seven or eight you know. Like that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours. It's just I don't know I oversleep but I like sleeping too. I mean yeah it's just the oversleeping part I don't like so much. Okay. How are your best friends by the way? Um. Um. Utterly insane in a good way. Utterly insane in a good way. Um. I guess. They would also say like you know there are times where I might seem like an asshole and I'm not really an asshole. I just you know I just have issues like everybody else. Um specifically I have Asperger's so that's a form of autism. Um that just kind of makes life awesome. They'd also say I'm flamboyant and eccentric because I totally am. I just I don't know. I figure I'm still alive so I should live because I'm still alive. And you know who knows how long I'm going to be alive for. So I should you know live while I'm alive and just go out and do stuff and not sit and be calm. Except when I'm reading. And I like reading. Um. Stop fucking up. No that's kind of messed up. Um. I think I would have told myself at the time. Um. Because I've known my evil ex. Um I've known her since like I was like six and she was five. I think ten years ago I would have grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl. Whatever you do do not date that girl. Don't trust her. She can't be trusted. And more importantly don't. Don't let your guard down around her because she'll she'll exploit that. And I mean like physically let your guard down not mentally. Um. Yeah don't don't date her just don't do it. It's not worth it. It's not worth the trouble. It's not worth the pain. It's not worth it. The fact that I'm still alive. Maybe. Yeah. I don't know. Cycling to Comic Con. I was pretty proud of that. Pretty proud that I managed to do it. Just I don't you know I don't really know. I don't really use the term pride. I don't really feel pride. I'm just it's more of like the fact that I'm still alive I'm proud to be alive. I don't know if that makes me humble or just insane. Who knows. Okay I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Do I press the button now? Oh bye. Okay. Do do do do do do do. By the way her eyes are really creepy. Just saying that. Is it just the way that they. They they they have the uncanny.",
         "Okay, that looks good. Okay, when she says goodbye, we're just going to press this button and I'll come back over. Okay? So she'll start asking questions after. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Sure. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good, I guess. That's good. Okay. Why did you move to LA? Well, I guess you're not programmed with this knowledge, but Katrina happened in 2005. Wow. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Not really. Want to tell me about that? Um... Where to begin? Uh, just LA is different culturally. I have a different culture out here. It's just a different place. Mm-hmm. What are some things you really like about LA? Um, it's bike-friendly. Louisiana isn't. New Orleans, for that matter, really isn't. Now they're trying to be, but it just isn't that successful. What are some things you know about LA? The drivers. They're crazy. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not really, kind of, but not much anymore. Why? I don't have the money. Kind of broke. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just being able to go on an adventure. I'd love to hear about all your trips. Um, let's see. I once went to Comic-Con on a bicycle, like a three-wheel bike. Um, and that was pretty fun. Kind of scary and dangerous. Nearly got killed. It was scary. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Traveling or just in general. Whatever comes to your mind. Hmm. Um, I gotta say we were heading out of, um... We were heading off the PCH and going into Laguna. And Laguna has this really steep hill and on Sundays it's full of traffic. And I remember going down the hill and my brakes weren't working. And I was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just wouldn't click. And I was like, oh god. And I'm on a three-wheel bike so I'm larger than most bikes. And I'm like zipping in between gridlock traffic. Going down a hill, unable to brake. And I'm going down and suddenly there's this car that veers right into... Essentially where I'm trying to go. So I turn sharply in front of... Between this bus and this truck. And literally end up going sideways through traffic, through oncoming traffic. And then looping back through oncoming traffic, back into the right traffic. Still without any brakes. And not managing to keep my bike from rolling, which is painful when your bike rolls. It kind of hurts. A lot. So, yeah. Yeah, that's it. Various different things. Anthropology, visual effects. Kind of weird, but yeah. I've always had a fascination with film. And I think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating. Just as like the mob mentality of people. Yeah. Okay. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? Why? You know, I've never been afraid of what people think of me. Like people I don't know. I'm not afraid of what they think. I'm more concerned with the people I know and what they think of me. I guess. So being outgoing just doesn't really affect me. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. That's fine.

         "Here’s a summary of my experience with depression:\n\nI've been dealing with depression for a long time; it's something that's reoccurred multiple times. I was first diagnosed back in middle school, probably about ten to twelve years ago, when I was in sixth grade. It's a persistent thing.\n\nA big part of my history with depression and PTSD is linked to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. That giant storm in New Orleans leveled the town, and I lost a lot of friends. It's still there, even though I'm trying to get over it. It's hard to find anything positive in it; it just feels like a freak accident.\n\nMore recently, about two years ago, I went through a really bad breakup with my ex, who everyone calls my \"evil ex.\" That whole situation was just bad and went down poorly. I was really angry and depressed. I remember going on an extreme cycling spree, riding my bike for hundreds of miles in a single day, which left me in a ton of pain. It wasn't good, but it felt better than just overeating because I was depressed, which is something I did. We had screaming matches; it was not good. Breaking up with her was probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make because of the things she did that I just can't forgive.\n\nMy mood can be pretty unpredictable. Sometimes I'm feeling fine, but ask me in two hours, and who knows. I've learned that some things just happen, and you have to carry on with your life.\n\nOne of the biggest impacts of my depression is on my sleep. I have an incessant need to sleep, sometimes up to 14 hours a day. It's unproductive and a waste of time. While I like sleeping, I don't like the oversleeping part. I need about 12 hours to feel good, and even in crunch time, I need seven or eight hours, unlike my friends who can get by on six or even four.\n\nI also mentioned overeating as a symptom of my depression. My friends would probably say there are times I might seem like an asshole, but I just have my issues, like everyone else. I also have Asperger's, which is a form of autism, and that just kind of makes life \"awesome.\" They'd also say I'm flamboyant and eccentric, which I totally am.\n\nI've also struggled with my temper; I'm not good at controlling it, and it happens frequently. I've gotten into fights, even shoving someone's head through a locker in high school.\n\nI don't really feel pride in the traditional sense. It's more like I'm proud to be alive, given everything. I've had to learn not to regret the things I do, but rather the opportunities I've missed, especially in the last two years. I guess I'm just trying to live while I'm alive and go out and do stuff, rather than just sit around.",

Actually, I enjoy flying, then meeting different people, different scenes. Then I try to achieve my goals. I'm sorry? How did you get involved in the business? I used to run a business. I used to travel to meet people, to get orders. Traveling involved going to Northeast, Ohio and Pennsylvania, places like that. Meet top people to get orders for my business.

But my main goal, main objective was to get the orders for the business. Nice. What do you do for a living? I cook, watch movies, meet friends, throw a party. What do you do now? I'm talking to you. What did you study before? I'm an engineer. I did mechanical engineering. I'm also an MBA. Are you still working on it? Actually, I branched off to finance. I trade stocks now. How did you get involved in the business? A friend of mine was making a lot of money in stocks. First, I used to interact with him. I realized he was making a lot of money. Then I did a formal course in it. I attended a lot of seminars. Lost a lot of money before I started making money. What do you do for a living? I watch movies, visit people, play basketball, do shopping, cook. How are you doing? I'm very good at controlling my temper. When was the last time you argued with your brother? The last time I argued was with my brother. It was about my dad. He's getting old. He lives in India. I was planning on bringing him here. My brother said it's going to be very expensive with respect to health bills. I was arguing with him that we should all pull in the money and get them here. They are quite old. I have a mom too. They are both old. How close are you with your family? I'm very close to my parents. Not so close with my brother and their family. Why? I tend to be judgmental. I think sometimes that my niece and nephew should have been brought up in a different way. My brother doesn't seem to think along the same lines. We have disagreements and that's the reason. Do you think it's going to happen? It is. Do you believe in their race? No, not at this time. What do you think is going to happen? What do I think of what? What do you think is going to happen? Can you repeat that one more time? What do you think is going to happen? I still couldn't follow you. What's the matter with you? Have you ever served in the army? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. How long ago were you diagnosed? About one to two years ago. What made you decide to go into the army? I was feeling down and I was not interested in things that I was normally interested in. I was sort of withdrawn and I was not able to focus on my things. I went to see a doctor and I ended up doing that. Did you ever have trouble sleeping? No. What made you decide to go into the army? I lost appetite. I was not sleeping well. I had difficulty concentrating and focusing. I was not getting my assignments done on time. These were some of the problems. How have you been doing lately? I've been feeling good. You've been doing yoga? No, I don't. Why didn't you stop doing yoga? I started doing yoga and I've been doing that for about a year. And meditation. That's helped a lot. Awesome. What made you decide to do it? It's just that when I was diagnosed with depression, I thought I shouldn't be taking any medication for it. I was looking at other ways to get over the problem. Then I realized some of my friends were doing meditation and I got influenced by them. How easy is it to get rid of depression? It's a little difficult. But I've been able to sleep within half an hour. There are days when it takes almost one or two hours to go to sleep. Are you better by sleeping? Are they what? Can you repeat that? Are you better by sleeping? No. What are you working on these days? When did you last do yoga? Okay. What are you most proud of? What am I proud of? I was among the top 2% in my MBA class. When I used to run my business, I designed a product that was working really well. I was happy that I was able to design something that was so useful for my business. How are your best friends? I'm thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly, very easy to get along with, very focused, very intelligent, and a good cook. Who's your best friend? Albert Einstein. Can you tell me about that? Some of his theories involve a lot of deep thinking. The first few times I read about him, about his theories, I had difficulty in really understanding that. When there are things that I really try to understand and I'm not able to, they're all the type of people I admire. What advice would you give yourself? I would say to be open to other people. What is the thing you like about yoga? It's diverse and I like the entertainment industry. I like the fact that there are more women than men here. There are certain areas where only Spanish is spoken. I would like for all people who come to America to be able to understand English and be able to speak in English so that everybody can participate. What is the thing you like about doing yoga? In LA? What is the thing you like about doing yoga? Some of the things the political leaders do really make me mad. Sometimes I think they're wasting their time, our time, and other countries are advancing. These guys don't get things done and I feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry. What advice would you give to people? The first four years of the Obama administration I think it was wasted because if Congress had acted together and got things done, then maybe we could have made it much more difficult for China to catch up with us. The fact that China is able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still argue and find faults with each other and not get things done. They don't seem to realize that the clock keeps ticking. They have to get things done. What's one thing that makes you feel bad? One thing that comes to my mind is that I made a lot of money once in Los Angeles. I remember that it happened during Christmas some 10 years ago and that made me very happy. What is something that makes you feel bad? Good music, good food, a party with friends that I like, and I also like cooking and I enjoy cooking with groups. Those are things that really put me in a good mood. What advice would you give to people? I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope it was worth your time. Thank you so much. You've been nice. Bye. Thank you.",
         "Okay, this looks good. Great. Start this recording as well. Maybe something for our system. Now we start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit.

Oh, about 20 years ago.\nHow often do you go back to LA? Once every 3-4 years.\nHow did you get used to it? I mean, the first 6 months it was a little difficult.

Actually, I enjoy flying, then meeting different people, different scenes. Then I try to achieve my goals.\nHow did you get involved in the business? I used to run a business.

I enjoyed listening to their problems. I used to take them out for dinner. I genuinely enjoyed talking to them. Many of them were open enough to tell me about their problems. But my main goal, main objective was to get the orders for the business.\nNice. What do you do for a living? I cook, watch movies, meet friends, throw a party.\nWhat do you do now? I'm talking to you.\nWhat did you study before? I'm an engineer. I did mechanical engineering. I'm also an MBA.\nAre you still working on it? Actually, I branched off to finance.

Then I did a formal course in it. I attended a lot of seminars. Lost a lot of money before I started making money.\nWhat do you do for a living? I watch movies, visit people, play basketball, do shopping, cook.\nHow are you doing? I'm very good at controlling my temper.\nWhen was the last time you argued with your brother? The last time I argued was with my brother. It was about my dad. He's getting old. He lives in India. I was planning on bringing him here.

They are both old.\nHow close are you with your family? I'm very close to my parents. Not so close with my brother and their family.\nWhy? I tend to be judgmental.

That's helped a lot.\nAwesome. What made you decide to do it? It's just that when I was diagnosed with depression, I thought I shouldn't be taking any medication for it. I was looking at other ways to get over the problem. Then I realized some of my friends were doing meditation and I got influenced by them.\nHow easy is it to get rid of depression? It's a little difficult. But I've been able to sleep within half an hour. There are days when it takes almost one or two hours to go to sleep.\nAre you better by sleeping? Are they what? Can you repeat that? Are you better by sleeping? No.\nOkay. What are you most proud of? What am I proud of? I was among the top 2% in my MBA class. When I used to run my business, I designed a product that was working really well. I was happy that I was able to design something that was so useful for my business.\nHow are your best friends?

         "Here is a summary of my experience with depression, in my own words:\n\nAbout one to two years ago, I was diagnosed with depression. Before that, I had been feeling really down and had lost interest in things I normally enjoyed. I became sort of withdrawn and found it very difficult to focus on my tasks. I also noticed that I had lost my appetite and wasn't sleeping well. I struggled with concentrating and focusing, which led to me not getting my assignments done on time. These issues were what prompted me to seek help from a doctor.\n\nLately, I've been feeling good. When I was diagnosed, I decided I didn't want to take medication for it and instead looked for other ways to manage the problem. I was influenced by some friends who were doing meditation, so I started doing yoga and meditation myself about a year ago. That has helped a lot.\n\nGetting rid of depression is still a little difficult. While I've generally been able to sleep within half an hour, there are still days when it takes me almost one or two hours to fall asleep. Even when I do sleep, I wouldn't say that sleeping alone makes me feel better.",
