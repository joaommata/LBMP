All my family's here, friends, a mixture of people, and a lot of things to do. Okay. What did you study at school? Early childhood education. Nice. Are you still working in that? No, not right now, but I would love to get back into it. Why? Love working with kids, seeing them smile. Tell me more about that. I guess it goes back to when I was a kid. I liked being happy and playful, so I guess it just transferred to my adult life. What's your dream job? Working with kids as a school teacher, or in that capacity. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is, but if it's a passion of yours, it'll always be fun. That's great. How close are you to your family? Very close. Sometimes too close. Can you give me an example of that? I have four sisters and one brother. On my mom's side, and on my dad's, I have six brothers and four sisters. We are intertwined together, so that's why I say we're too close sometimes. I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself an engineer? No. Why? I have a lot of friends that I interact with, and we're always doing different things, so that's why I say I'm not. Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? Curse. Just let it out. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? A couple days ago. My nephew didn't call me back. How did you feel in that moment? Kind of mad, because I had set aside some time to spend with him, and he just blew it off and then called me back. Yeah. That sucks. Yeah, I know. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm okay. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When my mother passed. I'm sorry. Tell me more about that. It's been about five years now to the day. It's getting better. Time makes it easier. That's good. Do you feel down? A lot, because there's a lot of things that make me think about her on a daily basis. Like what? Anything. Driving by a particular restaurant that she likes, watching different TV shows. Just anything that could trigger a memory of my mom. Yeah. When was the last time that happened? Yesterday. How do you cope with them? I think about the good times. Don't stay in that place too long. Just go ahead and think about it and move on. Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not officially, but I think I might be depressed. Tell me more about that. Well, since my mom passed, it's been kind of rough. The job situation is not stable here in California, so that has a lot to do with it as well. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is. Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Not really. I've been sort of just to myself, reserved. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Not really. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. What are you like when you do sleep well? Grumpy, irritable, fidgety, big ball of nerves. Do you travel a lot? What do you mean? Whatever comes to your mind. I guess so, yeah. I like to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting new people, different locations, scenery, different opportunities to try something new in a new location. Awesome. I'd love to hear about your trips. I just came back from Memphis about three weeks ago. Going to see family and friends. It was pretty nice. Got a chance to see something new. Change the scenery. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Wow. Stick to the plan and don't veer off to the left or right. Just go straight ahead. What made you decide to do that? Just different circumstances in life that gradually pushed me towards the left and the right. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Every day. Is there anything you regret? A few relationships, not staying in school, missing out on great opportunities with employers. How would your best friend describe you? Funny, loyal, spontaneous, life of the party. How do you know them? Grew up together in the same community, went to school together, high school friends. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Big sister Michelle, my friend Troy. I mean there's others, but those two, no matter good or bad, they're always in my corner for me. Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. When was the last time you were really happy? Yesterday. Celebrated birthday. Ah. That's great. I'd love to hear all about it. It was just a little small, intimate setting. Cooked a meal, had family and friends over, listened to music, watched movies, talked about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one unit. So it was just a nice evening. Yeah. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye bye. Was the screen like that the whole time? While I was talking. It was? Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. That's very bizarre. I've never seen you do that before. Have to do it over? No.",

So there we go. Perfect. And now we can get started. When you're finished, when she's done, we'll hit this so that I know that it's going to be okay. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? Okay. How about yourself? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? Here in California. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Oh, well, that is big and brought us a lot to do, a lot of job opportunities in other states. Pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here. Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Maybe the violence rate, the bad news, even though you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still have to watch it so you can look out to see what's going on on a daily basis. What did you study at school? Sociology. I have a two-year degree in liberal arts, but my major was sociology. Nice. Are you still working in that? No. I'm still working as a MTA bus operator. What's your dream job? Well, since METRO is study growing, my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week. So, because they look to promote within the company, so that's a good thing. It's a lot of opportunities at METRO where you can take classes and they'll pay for tuition and things of that nature. That sounds like a great situation. Thanks. How hard is that? Well, it's not actually hard. Right now, it's easy if you take advantage of it right now because they look to promote within, so since I'm already working there, that's a good thing. So, it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible. Do you consider yourself an introvert? What do you mean? I'm sorry. Let's come back to that later. Okay. What do you do to relax? Read, take a long walk, hot bath, meditate, just close my eyes sometimes. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty much good because see, by me being a bus operator, you run into circumstances and situations, you've got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time. How hard is that? Well, I look at it like it goes with experience. You do something on a continuous basis. Usually, somewhere down the line, you become good at it. I look at it like that. I've been driving for years and dealing with the public, so it's just how you handle circumstances. You treat people like you want to be treated. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. I'm pretty good at it now, maybe when I was younger. As you get older, you get wiser and you learn different things, and I'm still learning today. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I would say my family, my kids. Even though I've been having a lot of deaths around me, but that's part of the life experience. You're born here, but you've got to leave here one day. My kids will keep me sane, and I love them, and my family. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Setting good examples, because you're the first teacher. You want to set a positive good example for your kids, and I think that's a good thing, and it starts at home. Can you give me an example of that? By you being the first teacher, you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up. Whatever's been taught in the home, they look in and learn every day. Whether it's at home school, kids have a tendency to do things what they see. You try to keep it positive, teach them good morals and values, and how to get along with other people, regardless of race, and different things of that nature. How many of your kids? I have a four and a half year old son. I have a seven year old daughter, and I also have a 23 year old. I'm about to be, well, my daughter's pregnant with the boy. She has three little girls, so I have three grandkids, and one on the way, which is the boy this time. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? The hardest thing is, well right now, I'm a single parent, so that makes it hard alone itself. They can be expensive at times, and it depends on the person's situation, whether they have help or a job, things of that nature to help the situation better. But it's hard. I try to keep a job, keep food in the house, just maintain and support my kids the best way I can. What's one of your most memorable experiences? With my kids, or just period. Whatever comes to your mind? What's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree. So it's kind of like, yeah, even though I'm the baby of ten kids, and I always kept that in the back of my mind, even though everybody, well pretty much my whole family have a decent job, but I'm the one with a degree. So I kind of gave myself a pat on the back. That's the only thing I remember in graduating, and my family there to support me. That's so good to hear. Thank you. How did you feel in that moment? Happy that I accomplished something. Even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma. I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident. I never went back. I got distracted. I was working at the same time, but I was just like more so. I needed income than schooling at that time, because I was a young parent, because I had my daughter at 17, so I was like I needed the money to support her. But I never went back, but I feel like it's never too late. So I felt like I'd take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder, so that's why I'm starting my class next week. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Hmm. Well, the advice I would have gave myself, that I probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age, and that I probably wouldn't have stayed in school, not let the accident just distract me. I would have remained in school. I probably wouldn't have had kids early. I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something. I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person, just having knowledge and learning different things. Keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day. So I think that's a plus in anybody's shoes, just to better themselves through education, maybe to promote within your company, or whatever the case may be to help better your career. Yeah. Have you done anything to avoid it? I'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes, but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones. I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change, like myself, even though I'm going to school late, but still, I'm going. I want to better myself career-wise. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Yes. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? My oldest daughter. We had an argument because just the life she's living right now and the things that she's going through, and I had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation. We got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear the stuff that you're saying, even though it's true, or they just don't want to hear it. They may be going through something they don't want to hear, but we got into an argument about it, but that just happened. I just told her my- How close are you to them? I'm sorry? How close are you to them? Very close. Very close. The situation my daughter is in right now, she just needs to make some changes to better her life. She's kind of like stubborn in her own way. I was raised to listen to your mom. Your mom was not going to tell you nothing wrong. I've been telling her over the years different things. It's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite, and now she's regretting it. She's like, my mom told me this. Why am I doing the opposite? I guess she's got to bump her head a couple of times to get it. It's kind of like I didn't tell you, I didn't leave it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change. How hard is that? It's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. It seems like it's taking forever for her to change, but it's left up to the individual when they're ready. You know what I mean? Once a person gets tired of something, they make a change. It may not be when you want it to happen, but the ball is in her court. I only can do so much. I see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Oh, wow. I have my days. Since I have two little ones, I kind of like train them to go to bed at 8 o'clock because they've got to go to school. I think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kind of like gets you ready for the next day. How are you going to feel if you rest? What type of person are you going to be that day? I'm going to be that day because everybody has their days, whether they're good or bad, but that's just part of life. I feel like if you had a good night's rest, hopefully you'll have a good day. Do you feel that way often? Pretty much. I need my rest because I'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people. The job itself is very stressful, so I feel like if I'm rested it'll help me. What are you like when you don't sleep well? What am I like? Irritated, tired, lazy. I feel like I'll want to lay down and probably go to sleep and get the rest that I need. What do you do when you're annoyed? I never thought about that. Like I said, everybody has their moments, they do. I never thought about that. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? I don't really have a best friend, but a person that I deal with, that I used to work with, she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing, a go-getter, dependable, responsible. I'm a people person. I get along with others. I leave a good mark, whether I know you or not. If you were like you and I now, you'd probably say, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever, something like that. That's great. Thank you. When was the last time you felt really happy? Well, I try to stay happy. I'd rather be happy than sad. My kids keep me going, you know what I mean? Especially when I go to pick them up from school or maybe, hey mom, you know, that just kind of like make my day. Just them run up to me, you know, and be happy and excited. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're more than welcome. You have a good day. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. You're welcome. So I'm going to turn all this off and then we can just have a little closer look. Okay. That is so interesting. Mm-hmm.",
         "Okay, there you are. Wow. You won't see yourself this whole time. Okay. So I'm just going to move around so I can activate the connect, which is what's recording your body. Okay. So there we go. Perfect. And now we can get started. When you're finished, when she's done, we'll hit this so that I know that it's going to be okay. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today?\nOkay. How about yourself?\nI'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally?\nHere in California.\nReally? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA?\nOh, well, that is big and brought us a lot to do, a lot of job opportunities in other states. Pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here. Yeah.\nWhat are some things you don't really like about LA?\nTraffic. Maybe the violence rate, the bad news, even though you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still have to watch it so you can look out to see what's going on on a daily basis.\nWhat did you study at school?\nSociology. I have a two-year degree in liberal arts, but my major was sociology. Nice.\nAre you still working in that?\nNo. I'm still working as a MTA bus operator.\nWhat's your dream job?\nWell, since METRO is study growing, my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week. So, because they look to promote within the company, so that's a good thing. It's a lot of opportunities at METRO where you can take classes and they'll pay for tuition and things of that nature.\nThat sounds like a great situation. Thanks. How hard is that?\nWell, it's not actually hard. Right now, it's easy if you take advantage of it because they look to promote within, so since I'm already working there, that's a good thing. So, it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible.\nDo you consider yourself an introvert?\nWhat do you mean? I'm sorry.\nLet's come back to that later. Okay.\nOkay. Read, take a long walk, hot bath, meditate, just close my eyes sometimes.\nHow are you at controlling your temper?\nI'm pretty much good because see, by me being a bus operator, you run into circumstances and situations, you've got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time.\nHow hard is that?\nWell, I look at it like it goes with experience. You do something on a continuous basis. Usually, somewhere down the line, you become good at it. I look at it like that. I've been driving for years and dealing with the public, so it's just how you handle circumstances. You treat people like you want to be treated.\nHas that gotten you in trouble?\nNo. I'm pretty good at it now, maybe when I was younger. As you get older, you get wiser and you learn different things, and I'm still learning today.\nWho's someone that's been a positive influence in your life?\nI would say my family, my kids. Even though I've been having a lot of deaths around me, but that's part of the life experience. You're born here, but you've got to leave here one day. My kids will keep me sane, and I love them, and my family.\nThat sounds like a great situation. Thank you. Do you find it easy to be a parent?\nNo.\nWhat's the hardest thing about being a parent?\nSetting good examples, because you're the first teacher. You want to set a positive good example for your kids, and I think that's a good thing, and it starts at home.\nCan you give me an example of that?\nBy you being the first teacher, you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up. Whatever's been taught in the home, they look in and learn every day. Whether it's at home school, kids have a tendency to do things what they see. You try to keep it positive, teach them good morals and values, and how to get along with other people, regardless of race, and different things of that nature.\nHow many of your kids?\nI have a four and a half year old son. I have a seven year old daughter, and I also have a 23 year old. My daughter's pregnant with the boy. She has three little girls, so I have three grandkids, and one on the way, which is the boy this time. Awesome.\nYeah, thank you. What's the hardest thing about being a parent?\nThe hardest thing is, well right now, I'm a single parent, so that makes it hard alone itself. They can be expensive at times, and it depends on the person's situation, whether they have help or a job, things of that nature to help the situation better. But it's hard. I try to keep a job, keep food in the house, just maintain and support my kids the best way I can.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nWith my kids, or just period.\nWhatever comes to your mind?\nWhat's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree. So it's kind of like, yeah, even though I'm the baby of ten kids, and I always kept that in the back of my mind, even though everybody, well pretty much my whole family have a decent job, but I'm the one with a degree. So I kind of gave myself a pat on the back. That's the only thing I remember in graduating, and my family there to support me.\nThat's so good to hear. Thank you. How did you feel in that moment?\nHappy that I accomplished something. Even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma. I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident. I never went back. I got distracted. I was working at the same time, but I needed income than schooling at that time, because I was a young parent, because I had my daughter at 17, so I needed the money to support her. But I never went back, but I feel like it's never too late. So I felt like I'd take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder, so that's why I'm starting my class next week.\nThat sounds like a great situation. Thank you. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nHmm. Well, the advice I would have gave myself, that I probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age, and that I probably wouldn't have stayed in school, not let the accident just distract me. I would have remained in school. I probably wouldn't have had kids early. I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something. I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person, just having knowledge and learning different things. Keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day. So I think that's a plus in anybody's shoes, just to better themselves through education, maybe to promote within your company, or whatever the case may be to help better your career. Yeah.\nHave you done anything to avoid it?\nI'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes, but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones. I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change, like myself, even though I'm going to school late, but still, I'm going. I want to better myself career-wise.\nThere are always trade-offs in life, aren't there?\nYes.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nMy oldest daughter. We had an argument because just the life she's living right now and the things that she's going through, and I had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation.

I guess she's got to bump her head a couple of times to get it. It's kind of like I didn't tell you, I didn't leave it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. It seems like it's taking forever for her to change, but it's left up to the individual when they're ready. You know what I mean? Once a person gets tired of something, they make a change. It may not be when you want it to happen, but the ball is in her court. I only can do so much.\nI see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nOh, wow. I have my days.

         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression. I try to stay happy, preferring that over being sad, and my kids really keep me going and sane, especially when they greet me from school.

But financially I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. So I was happy because I was getting callbacks.

Can't really answer that one. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Okay. I'm gonna go ahead and shut everything down and then we just have a quick booster here for you to fill out.",
         "I've felt depressed for a long time, even before I was diagnosed about three or four years ago. My mood is often down, and it just sucks. I struggle with a lack of energy and interest, and I often want to sleep a lot. Getting a good night's sleep is hard; I couldn't sleep last night because I was just thinking about my situation, like my car payment that was due yesterday. My appetite is uncontrollable; either I don't eat enough or I'm gluttonous and eat the wrong things.\n\nMy current situation is really tough; I can't find a job, and that makes me really mad and depressed. I've applied everywhere, from entry-level to management, but nothing. It's hard to survive day by day, just trying to eat. The recent passing of my sister six months ago, and becoming homeless and jobless two weeks ago, have made things even worse. I got to a point where I just missed her and wanted to be with her. I'd like to give up, but I can't put my parents through burying another daughter. This isn't the first time I've felt this way; 20 years ago, I tried to commit suicide instead of returning to my corporate manager job.\n\nI used to be an extrovert, but lately, I've become quite an introvert and stay to myself. I don't feel as confident, charming, or social anymore. My family is pretty dysfunctional, so I can't depend on them; I just depend on myself. I've found therapy useful in the past, but I don't have health insurance now, so I can't access it. To relax, I meditate and skateboard. Sometimes I just go for a nice sunset skate and meditate on my board, which helps me relax.",

I'm going to be speaking to you about the new things that are coming in your company. Are you okay with it? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing? I'm doing good. Arizona. Really? Why do you live so long? Because of acting and other stuff like the entertainment industry. Are you still working on it? No. Not at the moment at least. I'm currently a student. Okay. What are you doing to make music? I produce hip hop. I rap and produce hip hop. I play video games and then hang out with people. Awesome. Do you do music? No. How are you doing? Not very good. I break things. When was the last time you argued with someone? On the way over here, my mom and how to get here. What's the thing you like about LA? The beach. What's on your computer? It's a computer. Do you have a local? No. The last place I went was Los Cabos. No. Not Los Cabos. Where did I go? Somewhere in Mexico. Have you ever seen the ocean? Have you ever been back in Mexico City? No. Have you ever been back in Mexico City? Yes. How long ago were you back in Mexico City? Like four years ago. Okay. Did you go there long? Right now, no. How easy is it to be back in Mexico City? Lately, not very easy. Did you go that way often? No. Just lately. Did you sleep at a park outside?

I try to keep my mind off of it. I do yoga and other things to keep my mind off of everything. Have you ever been to therapy now? I never went to therapy. Why? Wait. No. I did go to therapy. When was the last time you went to therapy? Three or four years ago. I went to a separate therapist, but then I went to a thing where they did a bunch of cognitive tests and memory tests, and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time. I get depressed and it lasts for months on end. What type of therapy do you do? Okay. What were your symptoms? I don't know. What the fuck? Let's come back to that later. Yeah. Do you have any memories of that? I mean, my wife left like three weeks ago, so yes. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done, so yeah. Well, considering I'm only 19, if I could go back 19 years, I would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would have drove away my wife and not to be angry. Yeah. Driving away my wife. Yes, many, many things every day. Well, I could have not broken stuff, and I could have stopped. Like I was basically blocking out the external universe, and I was putting everything into myself and focusing on other things so that I don't focus on the real life. I was basically escaping. And so in that sense, I wasn't paying attention to her, and that's basically why she left. I mean, that and being angry is like both contributed their own proportion. Their own portion.

Like one day, one second, I'll be really happy, and then another second, I'll be really sad because I'll think about something again. It's like I got to keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like think. And I really know how to explain it. It's just something you feel. No, you need better programming. Silly.

Okay, now you're going to chat with her for a bit, and then when you are done, I'm going to give you the doorbell again, and I'm going to put it right over there. Okay. When she says you're done talking, if you just want to ring it to let me know. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming to Music Week. I just created a song for people in the same community here in Miami. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me an email. And your answers are really important. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, are you doing okay? Quite well. I feel good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Here. Really? Mm-hmm. One of the few native-born Los Angelesians. What do you do now? I homeschool my 10-year-old son, and I'm a homemaker. I have five children and married 22 years. Wow. Mm-hmm. So that's a full-time job. Huh? Have you traveled a lot? Somewhat. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah. So I would say yes. I've traveled a bit. I'd love to hear about one of your friends. Well, most recently, like two months ago, we went to Israel for a pilgrimage. We were gone about nine days, and it was fabulous. We spent the first five days in Korazim, which is near the Galilee, and in a place called... I mean, the name of the area is Korazim, but we stayed in a place called the Doma Scalileia, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. That's so good to hear. What do you enjoy about traveling? I enjoy... Really, the most important thing I enjoy is meeting the people and, of course, seeing the history, especially Israel. I mean, it's totally ancient, but most I enjoy is the people, I think, to get a better understanding of how different cultures live. Okay. You can do this all by yourself? No, not at all. Why? Just don't. All my life, I've always been open and willing to socialize, and I remember my younger brother always joking, saying that I would talk to anybody, and I will. I'll talk to just about anybody, just because I enjoy learning about other people. That's good. What do you do to relax? By the end of the day, after I've cooked dinner, and we've had dinner together as a family, there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while, and then watch TV, have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax. That's what we do. Because we have a lot going on, we don't stay up too late, and I like to watch crime dramas. Nice. What does it mean to be really mad? Really mad? Probably not a lot. I get frustrated with, for example, my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever, so that gets me angry. In terms of really getting heatedly angry, other than little things that my children do, especially my oldest child who's 21, he can be confrontational. Other than that, nothing really gets me really angry. I haven't felt that. What's the best thing about being human? Contributing to society, helping to raise responsible people, I guess. Of course, the love and the affection and the fun and the excitement that goes with it, and all the stages that go. Right now, I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers. I have one 11-year-old, and the rest are all teenagers and adults. It's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world, and have challenging discussions and that sort of thing. It's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and changing diapers and that kind of stuff. What's the hardest thing about being human? The hardest thing is that it's 24-7. You're never not a parent, and so you have to accept that. I remember with my first child thinking, when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. There's no going back. I guess you could if you did something horrible, but in normal circumstances you can't change that. It's a permanent thing. In some ways it takes away your freedom, but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. I'm sorry? I didn't get what you said. Some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life, most importantly my church and my faith, but also my husband. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very logical thinking and very grounded. If I get emotional or I get upset about something, we balance each other out. Likewise, if he gets upset about something, I'm able to balance him out. That's been a great gift in my life. How do you do it completely? I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper. Occasionally I get angry, but rarely do I have outbursts. I'm more likely to say what I feel, not let it build up. My husband and I don't rarely fight, have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that. It almost never happens. Like I said, I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot. If I'm thinking something, I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. That's good. When was the last time you argued with your husband? Usually I'm arguing with my older son because he thinks he knows everything. He's 21 years old, so he has the know-it-all mentality. I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all. As life goes on, he'll learn more. He's very confident and very self-assured. He thinks that everything he does is correct. He still has a lot of learning to do. It sounds really hard. It can be. What do you think is a good kid? I think that many of them are spoiled and live in an environment of instant gratification, which I think is going to be detrimental to the future of this country. Given that, with all the technology we have, there's really not any way to go back. I have hope that they will... I think this country was built on hard work and ethics. Hopefully, the next generation and the generations after that can maintain that standard of living. I don't know if it's possible. How would your best friend describe you? As loving, nurturing, funny. We laugh a lot. Caring, honest. Things that... I mean, my best friend... Well, actually, my best friend is... It's two people, it's two sisters that I grew up with. We, for some years, took care of their mother who has Alzheimer's before my parents got sick. I have a very close relationship with them, still do. I'm considered the fourth sister. I would say that those are my best friends. We love each other very much. It's a good relationship. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long have you been diagnosed with depression? Minorally, depression. It was more anxiety. Probably... It's probably been five or six years. I've had it off and on all my life, but it was never diagnosed originally. As a teenager, I think is when I first started with the anxiety. Other than that, I... Depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. But now it's under control. I have a great... Are you triggered by something? No, I think it was what they call free-floating anxiety. I think it's a kind of organic reason for it. In other words, there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The holidays were great. We had a good family gatherings. A little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out. My dad is really sick. We've offered to move in with them. They have a big home, but we would have to do a lot of... Some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around. We're in the throes of that. That's a big change, but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get... They're in their 80s. As they get closer to death, I want to have my family there with them. I understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not easy. Usually, all my life I think I've always... I mean, I've always had... At least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, basically. Other than that, I mean, no. Now I sleep well. Other than that, I sleep well. But sometimes if I wake up really early in the morning, then I can't go back to sleep. I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on what my schedule is and if the kids have to be at school early. There's a lot of factors. That sucks. Yeah, sometimes it does. What are you making your sleep from? Probably basically the same. I think I might complain a bit like, oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever, you know. But I think overall I'm probably the same. My kids know. I'll tell my kids, oh, I'm really tired. And they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful. And maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know, they may pitch in a little bit more. I can understand she's using it to be there. Not really. Not, not, no. Not really. Not anything significant. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Actually, yes, I do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Tell me more about that. Well, we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety. And we have had her in therapy for some time. And we just recently are, we're about to finish a group with her. It was a six month group for DBT, it's called. And it's like a, it's the first time, it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And it's been really good. It's been very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental strategies to keep your, keep you from your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or, you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So that's the focus of the therapy. And it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter. And it's been really, really informational and really helpful, I think. That's so good to hear. What got you to see the company? Oh, my daughter was, she was in a bad way. She was, you know, suffering a lot. And we knew it and we acted on it. That's all. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Like really joyful and happy, I would say probably. I mean, probably it would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the, in Cana. So, you know, where the wedding of Cana took place. That was really moving and beautiful. And it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day. We flew to Israel. So it was right at the same time. It was beautiful. Very meaningful. And other than that, I would say, you know, like other joyful occasions have been, you know, like Christmas and, you know, family gatherings and, you know, my dad's birthday. He turned 83 on Christmas Eve, you know, that kind of thing. So. What are some things that you do? That's an interesting question. I would say once I get like things done that I need to do, like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once I get them done, I feel like a sense of accomplishment. You know, much like I mean, I worked for many years as an administrative manager at UCLA. And, you know, once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that you have to make deadlines. There's that feeling of like, yeah, I got it done, you know. So I think that would be, you know, for me, the most most recent way of feeling good and feeling, you know, like feeling accomplished. What's your dream job? Dream job? I think I've already lived it. I'm also a birth doula. And yeah, and so I've attended a lot of births and now I really only do it for family and friends. And it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth, the bringing of new life into this world. So I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and I didn't know it. I trained much after, you know, I did my managerial stuff and was it is and was awesome. So I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed. But like I said, I do for family and friends. What made you decide to do it? I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She she happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children. And I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. We were close friends and, you know, her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there. She wanted me to stay. She didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it. So that was the first birth that I attended outside of, you know, my self-giving birth, which is a whole different experience. So after that, I was really interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery. But then I discovered this thing called being a doula, which is really gives you even a lot more hands on one on one contact with the patient, which is what I like. So I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old. No, 16 years ago. So, yeah, and I've been. Well, it can be challenging in terms of hours. It depends on how long the woman's in labor. But and, you know, also like for me, I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100 percent. I'm not doing it for business. And that way and because of that, I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available, somebody else could fill in for me. So but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me, I've been able to be there for some reason. So the the the only one that I missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby. I was with her for her first, but her labor went so fast she didn't even call me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor. She would even if she had called me, I would have been there in time. So went really fast. But other than that, you know, yeah, I've been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In all of life or in your job? Probably my my own birth. I mean, my the birth of my own children. Like there's an extreme sense of joy, excitement, relief, because of course you're out of the pain. And then like it's just it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's it's like something you can't explain. It's it's just it's awesome after you give birth. So and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I had my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both both experiences. I was my third child that had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic. But other than that, we laugh about it now. But when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she she was not there when the doctor I mean, it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And my husband was there, but she was not. No, it was a doctor. And she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that. And my daughter was born in the bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor. But I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago, 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more not as relaxed, not as like I feel now at my age that I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry about I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what you know, you know, like my I notice my daughters. Oh, Mom, you can't wear that because people are going to say this. I say, I don't care. You know, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that, oh, Mom, you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever. So that would probably be it. The wisdom that you you achieve with age that you see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. Most proud of. Probably my family, my husband and my my children. I mean, the fact that we've stayed married, that we've were an intact family, that my kids see every day how their friends suffer, who who come from divorced families or single parents. And they they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. Probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years, I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people I know from church. And it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. OK. OK. Goodbye. Hello, Squick.",

Okay, now you're going to chat with her for a bit, and then when you are done, I'm going to give you the doorbell again, and I'm going to put it right over there. Okay. When she says you're done talking, if you just want to ring it to let me know. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming to Music Week. I just created a song for people in the same community here in Miami. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me an email. And your answers are really important. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, are you doing okay? Quite well. I feel good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Here. Really? Mm-hmm. One of the few native-born Los Angelesians. What do you do now? I homeschool my 10-year-old son, and I'm a homemaker. I have five children and married 22 years. Wow. Mm-hmm. So that's a full-time job. Huh? Have you traveled a lot? Somewhat. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah. So I would say yes. I've traveled a bit. I'd love to hear about one of your friends. Well, most recently, like two months ago, we went to Israel for a pilgrimage. We were gone about nine days, and it was fabulous. We spent the first five days in Korazim, which is near the Galilee, and in a place called... I mean, the name of the area is Korazim, but we stayed in a place called the Doma Scalileia, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. That's so good to hear. What do you enjoy about traveling? I enjoy... Really, the most important thing I enjoy is meeting the people and, of course, seeing the history, especially Israel. I mean, it's totally ancient, but most I enjoy is the people, I think, to get a better understanding of how different cultures live. Okay. You can do this all by yourself? No, not at all. Why? Just don't. All my life, I've always been open and willing to socialize, and I remember my younger brother always joking, saying that I would talk to anybody, and I will. I'll talk to just about anybody, just because I enjoy learning about other people. That's good. What do you do to relax? By the end of the day, after I've cooked dinner, and we've had dinner together as a family, there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while, and then watch TV, have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax. That's what we do. Because we have a lot going on, we don't stay up too late, and I like to watch crime dramas. Nice. What does it mean to be really mad? Really mad? Probably not a lot. I get frustrated with, for example, my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever, so that gets me angry. In terms of really getting heatedly angry, other than little things that my children do, especially my oldest child who's 21, he can be confrontational. Other than that, nothing really gets me really angry. I haven't felt that. What's the best thing about being human? Contributing to society, helping to raise responsible people, I guess. Of course, the love and the affection and the fun and the excitement that goes with it, and all the stages that go. Right now, I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers. I have one 11-year-old, and the rest are all teenagers and adults. It's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world, and have challenging discussions and that sort of thing. It's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and changing diapers and that kind of stuff. What's the hardest thing about being human? The hardest thing is that it's 24-7. You're never not a parent, and so you have to accept that. I remember with my first child thinking, when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. There's no going back. I guess you could if you did something horrible, but in normal circumstances you can't change that. It's a permanent thing. In some ways it takes away your freedom, but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. I'm sorry? I didn't get what you said. Some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life, most importantly my church and my faith, but also my husband. He's very, very kind. He's very logical thinking and very grounded. If I get emotional or I get upset about something, we balance each other out. Likewise, if he gets upset about something, I'm able to balance him out. That's been a great gift in my life. How do you do it completely? I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper. Occasionally I get angry, but rarely do I have outbursts. I'm more likely to say what I feel, not let it build up. My husband and I don't rarely fight, have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that. It almost never happens. Like I said, I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot. If I'm thinking something, I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. That's good. When was the last time you argued with your husband? Usually I'm arguing with my older son because he thinks he knows everything. He's 21 years old, so he has the know-it-all mentality. I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all. As life goes on, he'll learn more. He's very confident and very self-assured. He thinks that everything he does is correct. He still has a lot of learning to do. It sounds really hard. It can be. What do you think is a good kid? I think that many of them are spoiled and live in an environment of instant gratification, which I think is going to be detrimental to the future of this country. Given that, with all the technology we have, there's really not any way to go back. I have hope that they will... I think this country was built on hard work and ethics. Hopefully, the next generation and the generations after that can maintain that standard of living. I don't know if it's possible. How would your best friend describe you? As loving, nurturing, funny. We laugh a lot. Caring, honest. Things that... I mean, my best friend... Well, actually, my best friend is two people, two sisters that I grew up with. We, for some years, took care of their mother who has Alzheimer's before my parents got sick. I have a very close relationship with them, still do. I'm considered the fourth sister. I would say that those are my best friends. We love each other very much. It's a good relationship. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long have you been diagnosed with depression? Minorally, depression. It was more anxiety. Probably... It's probably been five or six years. I've had it off and on all my life, but it was never diagnosed originally. As a teenager, I think is when I first started with the anxiety. Other than that, I... Depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. But now it's under control. I have a great... Are you triggered by something? No, I think it was what they call free-floating anxiety. I think it's a kind of organic reason for it. In other words, there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The holidays were great. We had a good family gatherings. A little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out. My dad is really sick. We've offered to move in with them. They have a big home, but we would have to do a lot of... Some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around. We're in the throes of that. That's a big change, but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get... They're in their 80s. As they get closer to death, I want to have my family there with them. I understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not easy. Usually, all my life I've always had... At least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, basically. Other than that, I mean, no. Now I sleep well. But sometimes if I wake up really early in the morning, then I can't go back to sleep. I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on what my schedule is and if the kids have to be at school early. There's a lot of factors. That sucks. Yeah, sometimes it does. What are you making your sleep from? Probably basically the same. I think I might complain a bit like, oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever, you know. But I think overall I'm probably the same. My kids know. I'll tell my kids, oh, I'm really tired. And they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful. And maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know, they may pitch in a little bit more. I can understand she's using it to be there. Not really. Not anything significant. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Actually, yes, I do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Tell me more about that. Well, we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety. And we have had her in therapy for some time. And we just recently are about to finish a group with her. It was a six month group for DBT, it's called. And it's like, it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And it's been really good. It's been very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental strategies to keep you from your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or, you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So that's the focus of the therapy. And it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter. And it's been really, really informational and really helpful, I think. That's so good to hear. What got you to see the company? Oh, my daughter was, she was in a bad way. She was, you know, suffering a lot. And we knew it and we acted on it. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Like really joyful and happy, I would say probably. I mean, probably it would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in Cana. So, you know, where the wedding of Cana took place. That was really moving and beautiful. And it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day. We flew to Israel. So it was right at the same time. It was beautiful. Very meaningful. And other than that, I would say, you know, like other joyful occasions have been, you know, like Christmas and, you know, family gatherings and, you know, my dad's birthday. He turned 83 on Christmas Eve, you know, that kind of thing. So. What are some things that you do? That's an interesting question. I would say once I get like things done that I need to do, like if I'm have a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once I get them done, I feel like a sense of accomplishment. You know, much like I mean, I worked for many years as an administrative manager at UCLA. And, you know, once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that you have to make deadlines. There's that feeling of like, yeah, I got it done, you know. So I think that would be, you know, for me, the most recent way of feeling good and feeling, you know, like feeling accomplished. What's your dream job? Dream job? I think I've already lived it. I'm also a birth doula. And yeah, and so I've attended a lot of births and now I really only do it for family and friends. And it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth, the bringing of new life into this world. So I would say that's probably was my dream job and I didn't know it. I trained much after, you know, I did my managerial stuff and was it is and was awesome. So I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed. But like I said, I do for family and friends. What made you decide to do it? I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children. And I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. We were close friends and, you know, her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there. She wanted me to stay. She didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it. So that was the first birth that I attended outside of, you know, my self-giving birth, which is a whole different experience. So after that, I was really interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery. But then I discovered this thing called being a doula, which is really gives you even a lot more hands on one on one contact with the patient, which is what I like. So I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old. No, 16 years ago. So, yeah, and I've been. Well, it can be challenging in terms of hours. It depends on how long the woman's in labor. But and, you know, also like for me, I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100 percent. I'm not doing it for business. And that way and because of that, I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available, somebody else could fill in for me. So but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me, I've been able to be there for some reason. So the only one that I missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby. I was with her for her first, but her labor went so fast she didn't even call me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor. She would even if she had called me, I would have been there in time. So went really fast. But other than that, you know, yeah, I've been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In all of life or in your job? Probably my own birth. I mean, the birth of my own children. Like there's an extreme sense of joy, excitement, relief, because of course you're out of the pain. And then like it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's like something you can't explain. It's just awesome after you give birth. So and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I had my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both experiences. I was my third child that had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic. But other than that, we laugh about it now. But when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she was not there when the doctor I mean, it was my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And my husband was there, but she was not. No, it was a doctor. And she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that. And my daughter was born in the bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor. But I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more not as relaxed, not as like I feel now at my age that I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what you know, like my I notice my daughters. Oh, Mom, you can't wear that because people are going to say this. I say, I don't care. You know, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that, oh, Mom, you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever. So that would probably be it. The wisdom that you achieve with age that you see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. Most proud of. Probably my family, my husband and my children. I mean, the fact that we've stayed married, that we've were an intact family, that my kids see every day how their friends suffer, who come from divorced families or single parents. And they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. Probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years, I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people I know from church. And it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. OK. OK. Goodbye. Hello, Squick.",
         "I've been diagnosed with depression, though it's been more minor depression and predominantly anxiety. I've had it off and on all my life, starting with anxiety as a teenager, but it was only formally diagnosed about five or six years ago. My anxiety is what they call free-floating, likely due to a chemical imbalance, not specific triggers.\n\nCurrently, my anxiety and depression are under control, and I've been feeling pretty good lately, especially after the holidays. However, sleep has always been a challenge for me; I often wake up in the middle of the night. If I wake up too early, I sometimes can't go back to sleep and might get up to do computer work before trying to sleep again. When I'm feeling tired or my body hurts, my kids notice and sometimes pitch in to help, like my older daughter being helpful or my other daughter trying to cook dinner.\n\nMy husband is a great support; we balance each other out if one of us gets emotional or upset. I also believe therapy is useful. We've been attending group therapy for DBT with our daughter, who also suffers from anxiety, and it's been very helpful for learning strategies to manage our minds and worries.",

We're not that type of organization. Yeah. This honesty. I don't like when people are dishonest. That really, really, really bothers me and not true, not honest, not real. That that upsets me a lot.

I'm okay with it at times, but I can definitely be better. Oh, I argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school and she she wants to raise her one way. And I think I want to raise her a kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations. So I think different discipline is a big key in a kid's life and she she she was raised a little differently. I don't know, just angry, upset, you know, when you're in an argument, that's what you feel. So you do and say things that that that bother you and you just you go on with it. Yeah, a little bit.

Let's see if I can start you up. Oh, actually, before that, one thing I almost forgot, I have to do something that syncs our equipment. There we go. All right. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just creative to talk to you about the world and state and the spirit environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And if things feel free to tell me everything, the answers are within comprehension. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm all right. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Oh, really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? The lights, the big city. It's always something going on. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic and that's it. Okay. What's your study at school? Business administration and business management. Are you still doing that? Not that. I'm doing networking at the moment. What's your dream job? Hmm. To open up a big clothing line and just supply the whole world with clothing. That sounds interesting. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Definitely. Why? Because I'm all about myself. It's all about me. Do you feel that way often? Not often, but more times than not, yeah. What are some things that you do really like? Being lied to and I guess when people think you're dumber than what you are. I understand. What do you do when you're in life? I try to get away from everything. Go into my own space. How are you at controlling your temper? Very well. I'm great at controlling my temper. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? Probably two days ago. It was probably just over some sports. It wasn't a real argument. Okay. Do you travel a lot? Not a lot, but I travel enough. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just being able to get a change of pace. See somebody new, see new faces, new environment. I'd love to hear about your trips. Let me see. The last trip I had was Vegas. You know how Vegas goes. It was pretty fun. There was a lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on. Nice. What would you say of somebody that's following you? Pretty open-minded. I'm kind to pretty much everybody. I'm a pretty even-killed guy. How do you like your living situation? It's alright. It could be better. Do you have roommates? No. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No, ma'am. Have you ever been diagnosed with stethoscopy? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Lately it's been pretty tough. I guess because I haven't stand up so late. That's my fault. Why? I don't know. I guess I'm a night owl all of a sudden. I'm turning into an owl. Okay. What are you like when you're not sleeping well? Sluggish and tired all day if I don't sleep well. All day I'm just laying around. Have you ever stayed in a hotel room? No. Not too much. Okay. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay focused and listen to the adults. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. Listen to the adults. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Tell me more about that. I mean, self-exponential. I think I just listened to parents or other adults that tried to stare you in the right way. You know, you're being a stubborn kid at those ages. So it's like, what are you talking about? It's my life. I can do what I want. I don't have to listen to you. But now I'm a good sleeper. I can still listen to you. But now I see that what they were telling me was correct. Yeah. How are your best friends describing you? Um, hilarious. Okay. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. You're someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Both my parents, mother and father. That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Recently, what did I do? New Year's Eve party. I had the time of my life. It was so fun. I'd love to hear all about it. This New Year's Eve, I went to a party at a friend's house in Balling Hills area. He had it at a pretty nice house. It's a three story house. And it was like 350 people in there. It was pretty fun. But it was also not that fun because it was so many people and you couldn't really move. So that was the only downfall. I brought my New Year in great with tons of friends. That's how it's supposed to be done. Awesome. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, I'm generally in a good mood every day. I mean, waking up puts me in a good mood. I guess you could say that. I don't know. I don't know. A good meal. That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? One of my most memorable experiences were probably when I was younger. I was in a Boy Scouts and we used to go camping all the time. And then one year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite, one of those places. And we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge. And of course being from the city I'm like mountain biking. I can ride a mountain bike. But once we got into the real mountains and got on real mountain bikes, I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers. It was pretty, it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense. I'll never forget that. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a tough one to answer. What am I most proud of? I don't know honestly. Bye. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one.",

Okay, alright, sounds good.

But, you know, it was challenging. I would say senior children grow up to be successful and exceeding your expectations. You worry all the time. You worry for them. You know, now I'm not around them as much and I certainly worry about them. Then I saw my children. About a week ago. I'm usually pretty happy when I see them. You know, I'm interested.

Well, it's, you know, it's, you know, I see a psychologist and we talk about things. I don't really want to elaborate in detail, but you know, it's, I seem to think that it's helpful. Well, I think.

I like to play soccer or something. It usually puts me in a good mood, particularly if my team wins. You know, I like USC. I have a nephew that's a freshman football player at USC.

When she's done, she'll let you know. I'm going to put the doorbell right next to you. So when she's done, just let me know. Hi, I'm Ellie. I'm a student at the University of New York. I'm not a very good student, but I'm very learning about people. I'm a graduate of the University of New York. I like to do research and research. I'm a student here at the University of New York. I like to do research and research. Are you a student here at the University of New York? Yes. So, are you Indian? Okay. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from India. Why do you miss the land? Why do I miss the land? Why do I miss LA? When did you start? Oh, about 20 years ago. How often do you go back to LA? Once every 3-4 years. How did you get used to it? I mean, the first 6 months it was a little difficult. But then I got used to it and I feel very comfortable now. That's good. Are you comfortable? Yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? The food. Actually, I enjoy flying, then meeting different people, different scenes. Then I try to achieve my goals. I'm sorry? How did you get involved in the business? I used to run a business. I used to travel to meet people, to get orders. Traveling involved going to Northeast, Ohio and Pennsylvania, places like that. Meet top people to get orders for my business. I enjoyed listening to their problems. I used to take them out for dinner. I genuinely enjoyed talking to them. Many of them were open enough to tell me about their problems. But my main goal, main objective was to get the orders for the business. Nice. What do you do for a living? I cook, watch movies, meet friends, throw a party. What do you do now? I'm talking to you. What did you study before? I'm an engineer. I did mechanical engineering. I'm also an MBA. Are you still working on it? Actually, I branched off to finance. I trade stocks now. How did you get involved in the business? A friend of mine was making a lot of money in stocks. First, I used to interact with him. I realized he was making a lot of money. Then I did a formal course in it. I attended a lot of seminars. Lost a lot of money before I started making money. What do you do for a living? I watch movies, visit people, play basketball, do shopping, cook. How are you doing? I'm very good at controlling my temper. When was the last time you argued with your brother? The last time I argued was with my brother. It was about my dad. He's getting old. He lives in India. I was planning on bringing him here. My brother said it's going to be very expensive with respect to health bills. I was arguing with him that we should all pull in the money and get them here. They are quite old. I have a mom too. They are both old. How close are you with your family? I'm very close to my parents. Not so close with my brother and their family. Why? I tend to be judgmental. I think sometimes that my niece and nephew should have been brought up in a different way. My brother doesn't seem to think along the same lines. We have disagreements and that's the reason. Do you think it's going to happen? It is. Do you believe in their race? No, not at this time. What do you think is going to happen? What do I think of what? What do you think is going to happen? Can you repeat that one more time? What do you think is going to happen? I still couldn't follow you. What's the matter with you? Have you ever served in the army? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. How long ago were you diagnosed? About one to two years ago. What made you decide to go into the army? I was feeling down and I was not interested in things that I was normally interested in. I was sort of withdrawn and I was not able to focus on my things. I went to see a doctor and I ended up doing that. Did you ever have trouble sleeping? No. What made you decide to go into the army? I lost appetite. I was not sleeping well. I had difficulty concentrating and focusing. I was not getting my assignments done on time. These were some of the problems. How have you been doing lately? I've been feeling good. You've been doing yoga? No, I don't. Why didn't you stop doing yoga? I started doing yoga and I've been doing that for about a year. And meditation. That's helped a lot. Awesome. What made you decide to do it? It's just that when I was diagnosed with depression, I thought I shouldn't be taking any medication for it. I was looking at other ways to get over the problem. Then I realized some of my friends were doing meditation and I got influenced by them. How easy is it to get rid of depression? It's a little difficult. But I've been able to sleep within half an hour. There are days when it takes almost one or two hours to go to sleep. Are you better by sleeping? Are they what? Can you repeat that? Are you better by sleeping? No. What are you working on these days? When did you last do yoga? Okay. What are you most proud of? What am I proud of? I was among the top 2% in my MBA class. When I used to run my business, I designed a product that was working really well. I was happy that I was able to design something that was so useful for my business. How are your best friends? I'm thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly, very easy to get along with, very focused, very intelligent, and a good cook. Who's your best friend? Albert Einstein. Can you tell me about that? Some of his theories involve a lot of deep thinking. The first few times I read about him, about his theories, I had difficulty in really understanding that. When there are things that I really try to understand and I'm not able to, they're all the type of people I admire. What advice would you give yourself? I would say to be open to other people. What is the thing you like about yoga? It's diverse and I like the entertainment industry. I like the fact that there are more women than men here. There are certain areas where only Spanish is spoken. I would like for all people who come to America to be able to understand English and be able to speak in English so that everybody can participate. What is the thing you like about doing yoga? In LA? What is the thing you like about doing yoga? Some of the things the political leaders do really make me mad. Sometimes I think they're wasting their time, our time, and other countries are advancing. These guys don't get things done and I feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry. What advice would you give to people? The first four years of the Obama administration I think it was wasted because if Congress had acted together and got things done, then maybe we could have made it much more difficult for China to catch up with us. The fact that China is able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still argue and find faults with each other and not get things done. They don't seem to realize that the clock keeps ticking. They have to get things done. What's one thing that makes you feel bad? One thing that comes to my mind is that I made a lot of money once in Los Angeles. I remember that it happened during Christmas some 10 years ago and that made me very happy. What is something that makes you feel bad? Good music, good food, a party with friends that I like, and I also like cooking and I enjoy cooking with groups. Those are things that really put me in a good mood. What advice would you give to people? I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope it was worth your time. Thank you so much. You've been nice. Bye. Thank you.",

I used to travel to meet people, to get orders. Traveling involved going to Northeast, Ohio and Pennsylvania, places like that. Meet top people to get orders for my business. I enjoyed listening to their problems. I used to take them out for dinner. I genuinely enjoyed talking to them. Many of them were open enough to tell me about their problems. But my main goal, main objective was to get the orders for the business. Nice. What do you do for a living? I cook, watch movies, meet friends, throw a party. What do you do now? I'm talking to you. What did you study before? I'm an engineer. I did mechanical engineering. I'm also an MBA. Are you still working on it? Actually, I branched off to finance. I trade stocks now. How did you get involved in the business? A friend of mine was making a lot of money in stocks. First, I used to interact with him. I realized he was making a lot of money. Then I did a formal course in it. I attended a lot of seminars. Lost a lot of money before I started making money. What do you do for a living? I watch movies, visit people, play basketball, do shopping, cook. How are you doing? I'm very good at controlling my temper. When was the last time you argued with your brother? The last time I argued was with my brother. It was about my dad. He's getting old. He lives in India. I was planning on bringing him here. My brother said it's going to be very expensive with respect to health bills. I was arguing with him that we should all pull in the money and get them here. They are quite old. I have a mom too. They are both old. How close are you with your family? I'm very close to my parents. Not so close with my brother and their family. Why? I tend to be judgmental. I think sometimes that my niece and nephew should have been brought up in a different way. My brother doesn't seem to think along the same lines. We have disagreements and that's the reason. Do you think it's going to happen? It is. Do you believe in their race? No, not at this time. What do you think is going to happen? What do I think of what? What do you think is going to happen? Can you repeat that one more time? What do you think is going to happen? I still couldn't follow you. Have you ever served in the army? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. How long ago were you diagnosed? About one to two years ago. What made you decide to go into the army? I was feeling down and I was not interested in things that I was normally interested in. I was sort of withdrawn and I was not able to focus on my things. I went to see a doctor and I ended up doing that. Did you ever have trouble sleeping? No. What made you decide to go into the army? I lost appetite. I was not sleeping well. I had difficulty concentrating and focusing. I was not getting my assignments done on time. These were some of the problems. How have you been doing lately? I've been feeling good. You've been doing yoga? No, I don't. Why didn't you stop doing yoga? I started doing yoga and I've been doing that for about a year. And meditation. That's helped a lot. Awesome. What made you decide to do it? It's just that when I was diagnosed with depression, I thought I shouldn't be taking any medication for it. I was looking at other ways to get over the problem. Then I realized some of my friends were doing meditation and I got influenced by them. How easy is it to get rid of depression? It's a little difficult. But I've been able to sleep within half an hour. There are days when it takes almost one or two hours to go to sleep. Are you better by sleeping? Are they what? Can you repeat that? Are you better by sleeping? No. Okay. What are you most proud of? What am I proud of? I was among the top 2% in my MBA class. When I used to run my business, I designed a product that was working really well. I was happy that I was able to design something that was so useful for my business. How are your best friends? I'm thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly, very easy to get along with, very focused, very intelligent, and a good cook. Who's your best friend? Albert Einstein. Can you tell me about that? Some of his theories involve a lot of deep thinking. The first few times I read about him, about his theories, I had difficulty in really understanding that. When there are things that I really try to understand and I'm not able to, they're all the type of people I admire. What advice would you give yourself? I would say to be open to other people. What is the thing you like about yoga? It's diverse and I like the entertainment industry. I like the fact that there are more women than men here. There are certain areas where only Spanish is spoken. I would like for all people who come to America to be able to understand English and be able to speak in English so that everybody can participate. What is the thing you like about doing yoga? In LA? Some of the things the political leaders do really make me mad. Sometimes I think they're wasting their time, our time, and other countries are advancing. These guys don't get things done and I feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry. What advice would you give to people? The first four years of the Obama administration I think it was wasted because if Congress had acted together and got things done, then maybe we could have made it much more difficult for China to catch up with us. The fact that China is able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still argue and find faults with each other and not get things done. They don't seem to realize that the clock keeps ticking. They have to get things done. What's one thing that makes you feel bad? One thing that comes to my mind is that I made a lot of money once in Los Angeles. I remember that it happened during Christmas some 10 years ago and that made me very happy. What is something that makes you feel bad? Good music, good food, a party with friends that I like, and I also like cooking and I enjoy cooking with groups. Those are things that really put me in a good mood. What advice would you give to people? I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope it was worth your time. Thank you so much. You've been nice. Bye. Thank you.",
         "I was diagnosed with depression about one to two years ago. At that time, I was feeling down and wasn't interested in things that I was normally interested in. I was sort of withdrawn and found it hard to focus on my things. I also lost my appetite and wasn't sleeping well, sometimes taking almost one or two hours to go to sleep. I had difficulty concentrating and focusing, which meant I wasn't getting my assignments done on time. When I was diagnosed, I decided I shouldn't be taking any medication for it, so I looked into other ways to get over the problem. I started doing yoga and meditation about a year ago, influenced by some friends, and that has helped a lot. It's still a little difficult to get rid of depression, and even when I sleep, it doesn't necessarily make me feel better.",

         " Okay, looks good. Do something for our purposes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Good. Chicago. It's cold in Chicago. Oh, I think in 90. 1989, actually. Oh, very simple. Very easy. Weather, of course. I'm so easily located to San Diego, Palm Springs, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and things I like to do. Smog, of course, is bad. Crime and retirement should be. And financial and economic problems here. Every year. Thanksgiving. Very, very much so. We're a very big family. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Very much in fact. I love flying on airplanes. I love visiting new places. I even like visiting different airports. Everyone's different. Oh, let's see. I started off in high school. I was in the pre-med. I ended up in physics. Yes, I teach physics. And math. My dad was a truant officer. And I've enjoyed it. It keeps you young. My dream job would be to be a judge. Yes, in the youth court. I'm not going to be able to do that. No. Not at all. I enjoy people. Being around people. I'm very talkative at times. I like to do a lot of things. I'm very social when I do them. Believe it or not, I play bridge. I play chess. And I watch a good old, old movie. Ooh. Bad drivers. Bad laws. Politics often. What do you do when you're annoyed? I really don't get annoyed that much. I just let it go. It's not worth the pain and problems it could cause. If I can't straighten out a problem, let it go. Go somewhere else. Always my bridge partner. But that's different. As far as anything else, I don't really argue with people. I don't like confrontation. My parents, of course. I had great parents. Can you tell me about that? My parents were at Tuskegee, which is a black college. They always want me to go to a black college, but of course I didn't want to do that. They're a very positive role model for me. I don't drink. I don't curse. I don't look down on people who do, but I don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things. I love to drive. I love to travel. My dad used to always take us someplace every weekend he was off. We'd go somewhere. We were in Chicago, Indiana, Michigan. Someplace in the area. We'd go to Michigan and pick fruit. We'd go to puppy farms in Indiana, that kind of thing. I had an uncle who lived in Wisconsin who was a dairy farmer. My dad used to love to drive, and I love to drive also. That's a hard one. I've had a lot of great experiences. I think the best one was we went, for my anniversary we went to Europe. We went to Paris. We rode the Orient Express. We didn't go all the way to Istanbul. We went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris. That was probably the best experience I've ever had in my life. I've never really cared for Europe because there's so much here in the United States to do and so much in America. I've been to Alaska and Hawaii, but we said we'd do something different. We'd always want to go on the Orient Express. We did that. Expensive, but a phenomenal trip. You've got to do it once. It's a once trip. Not once in a lifetime, just once. Not traveling more sooner. There are a lot of things we should have probably done we didn't do. We always went to Chicago on Thanksgiving, but I think we should have gone more than just on Thanksgiving. My parents come here around Christmas time, but I think we should have done a lot more when it comes to that. Yes, that's why it's a regret because it could have been avoided. We could have done a lot more things we could have done and we would have spent our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us. I think that people... Oh yes, very definitely. That's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago. I would have said don't take things too seriously, but don't be too relaxed over them either. Sometimes you can take things for granted. Never take anything for granted. Nothing's promised. Oh, heaven forbid. No, I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Very, very easy. I really have no problem with that. Once in a while. If I'm anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due, then I get kind of anxious a little bit. I don't like to be late. I don't like to make mistakes. Therefore, I do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that everything is right. What are you like when you're just being blown? Tired. I don't get irritable or anything. I'm just nostalgic maybe. I'm just a little bit. How have you been feeling lately? Very good. I was up late last night, so I'm kind of tired now. I usually have no problem sleeping. I get a good night's sleep. I just came back off a Christmas break. I should be very relaxed now. What are you most proud of in your life? I have great kids. I have a son at USC. I have a son at UCLA. My daughter just got married. I'm really proud of my kids. They're going to have a good life. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I enjoyed it. I still enjoy it. Being a parent is forever. What's the best thing about being a parent? Taking care of someone else and getting them started off to have a good life. I think that that's rewarding. Making sure everything is covered. That needs to be covered with your kids. Whether it's their eating, their sleeping, their clothes, their dress, make sure they're content. Make sure they have no problems at school or at home. Physically, mentally, spiritually, everything. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend would say she has not changed since high school. Level-headed, but a great sense of humor. Relaxed. I don't take things too seriously. When was the last time you felt really happy? I love the holidays. I love Christmas. I love everything about it. I love preparing the house for it. I love baking and cooking. Especially baking. I love experimenting with new recipes. The last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here, I felt fantastic. Everything is quiet. I'm not at work. I'm not stressed out in any way at all. I have no projects to do. I have to think about it anyway. Christmas time. Holiday time. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I really enjoyed it recently. Well, Christmas of course. We went to Las Vegas on the 27th of December. That was fantastic. We only stayed for two days. We had a really good time. We saw a great show. We had some great food. We drove there. We don't usually drive. I don't like to drive a lot, but we drove there and just took our time. That sounds like a great situation. It was good. It was nice. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye. Thanks for listening. How's that one? Okay. I have to ring the bell. My mind is wandering. Here we go. Hi there. Okay. Actually, before I do that, let me see if I can get the mic on. Okay.",

         "I generally feel very good and relaxed, especially after a break. I love the holidays, particularly Christmas, and during that time, I feel fantastic because everything is quiet, and I'm not stressed with work or projects. I don't tend to get annoyed easily; I prefer to just let things go, as I don't believe it's worth the pain or problems. I also avoid confrontation and arguments. When I'm just tired, I'm simply nostalgic, not irritable.\n\nI usually have no problem getting a good night's sleep. However, if I'm anxious about upcoming deadlines or projects, or worried about being late or making mistakes, that anxiety can keep me up all night to ensure everything is done perfectly. I enjoy being around people; I'm very social and talkative, and I like to do a lot of things like playing bridge and chess, or watching old movies. I'm very proud of my children and find being a parent rewarding, focusing on ensuring they are well taken care of physically, mentally, and spiritually.\n\nI've never been diagnosed with depression or PTSD. My main challenge is this anxiety related to performance and perfectionism, which occasionally affects my sleep. My coping strategies involve letting go of problems I can't fix, avoiding confrontation, and engaging in social activities and hobbies. My parents were great, positive role models, and I have a very big family. My anxiety is primarily triggered by work deadlines and my desire for perfection.",

I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully welcome. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Yes. So, how are you feeling today? Fine. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? Born and raised right here on the west side. Really? Venice Beach. Awesome. What's the things you like about LA? Everything. The beach, the weather. What about? The beach, the weather. Everything. Okay. The girls. What are the things you don't really like about LA? Nothing. Okay. Traffic maybe. I can't even remember. Who's someone that's been a positive employee? My family. I'd love to hear all about it. My mother. She's a very good-hearted person. Gives me good advice. That's good. What are some things you like to do for fun? Oh, pretty close. Yeah. Family comes first. Family's number one. Yeah. What are some things you like to do for fun? Go to the gym. You know, exercise. Go to the beach. Party every once in a while. Watch basketball, football. Okay. Take trips. Go to Vegas. What's the last time you had that? Which one? Went to the gym last night. I have friends that live in Vegas, so I go there often. Enjoying the travel? I just take a trip, get out. Get away from the city for a minute. But I'm a city boy, so it can't be way too long. You know, head up the city. What do you do to relax? I don't go to the beach. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, that's been a problem over the years. What's the only thing you worry about? I don't know. I just have a little anger, I guess. Anger management problem. When was the last time you had a problem with someone? Probably only yesterday. I forget what it was about. What do you do when you're in life? I go to the gym. What are some things that will be really annoying? People. Tell me more about that. I don't know, just people. Just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes. Okay. What's your dream job? Dream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Plan Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far, the past 10 years. Then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX. I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA Airport. Nice. What's one thing that most number of people experience? What, working at the airport? I guess during the holidays there was some girl that worked there. I had a crush on her, but she turned out to be a lesbian. She's beautiful. Yeah. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. Have you been diagnosed with a disease? I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No. Why did you stop? I just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped. I'm sorry you're late. No problem. It's not your fault. Do you think it's their disease? Excuse me? Did your parents just help you? It wasn't when I was a teenager. Tell me more about that. What, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know? How have you been doing lately? I'm not going forward as fast as I want to. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is. Have you done anything to avoid it? To avoid what? Going forward? I guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would. Excuse me? Yeah, I guess. Are there? Yeah, it's like mood swings, I guess. Mood swings? Are you triggered by something? It could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know? When was the last time you had a mood swing? Oh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today. Really? How did you fool around with me? Angry. How hard is it? Yeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know? Do you think you're going to be able to control it? No. Okay. How are your best friends? My best friends? My best friends? Excuse me? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? The goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted. That's great. Thank you. Is that even your address? Yeah. Yes. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then. What made you decide to do that? To do what? To do what? Let's come back to that earlier. When was the last time you were in the house? I don't know. Today. Happy to be here. That's great. What are some things that you really put into your life? Um, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah. What would you say is something you've best followed in? My best qualities? Just that, uh, qualities. Just that I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What do you mean by qualities? What comes to your mind? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay. I think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay, bye. Can I take her home with me? Is she, um, is she supposed to be a psychiatrist or can I hire her? Okay.",

I'm going to put the doorbell right next to you. So you can ring the door once you're done. Do I see her? Yeah, you'll see her. There she is. Wow. Here's your doorbell. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and to welcome them on you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully welcome. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Yes. So, how are you feeling today? Fine. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? Born and raised right here on the west side. Really? Venice Beach. Awesome. What's the things you like about LA? Everything. The beach, the weather. What about? The beach, the weather. Everything. Okay. The girls. What are the things you don't really like about LA? Nothing. Okay. Traffic maybe. I can't even remember. Who's someone that's been a positive employee? My family. I'd love to hear all about it. My mother. She's a very good-hearted person. Gives me good advice. That's good. What are some things you like to do for fun? Oh, pretty close. Yeah. Family comes first. Family's number one. Yeah. What are some things you like to do for fun? Go to the gym. You know, exercise. Go to the beach. Party every once in a while. Watch basketball, football. Okay. Take trips. Go to Vegas. What's the last time you had that? Which one? Went to the gym last night. I have friends that live in Vegas, so I go there often. Enjoying the travel? I just take a trip, get out. Get away from the city for a minute. But I'm a city boy, so it can't be way too long. You know, head up the city. What do you do to relax? I don't go to the beach. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, that's been a problem over the years. What's the only thing you worry about? I don't know. I just have a little anger, I guess. Anger management problem. When was the last time you had a problem with someone? Probably only yesterday. I forget what it was about. What do you do when you're in life? I go to the gym. What are some things that will be really annoying? People. Tell me more about that. I don't know, just people. Just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes. Okay. What's your dream job? Dream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Plan Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far, the past 10 years. Then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX. I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA Airport. Nice. What's one thing that most number of people experience? What, working at the airport? I guess during the holidays there was some girl that worked there. I had a crush on her, but she turned out to be a lesbian. She's beautiful. Yeah. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. Have you been diagnosed with a disease? I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No. Why did you stop? I just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped. I'm sorry you're late. No problem. It's not your fault. Do you think it's their disease? Excuse me? Did your parents just help you? It wasn't when I was a teenager. Tell me more about that. What, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know? How have you been doing lately? I'm not going forward as fast as I want to. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is. Have you done anything to avoid it? To avoid what? Going forward? I guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would. Excuse me? Yeah, I guess. Are there? Yeah, it's like mood swings, I guess. Mood swings? Are you triggered by something? It could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know? When was the last time you had a mood swing? Oh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today. Really? How did you fool around with me? Angry. How hard is it? Yeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know? Do you think you're going to be able to control it? No. Okay. How are your best friends? My best friends? Excuse me? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? The goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted. That's great. Thank you. Is that even your address? Yeah. Yes. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then. What made you decide to do that? To do what? Let's come back to that earlier. When was the last time you were in the house? I don't know. Today. Happy to be here. That's great. What are some things that you really put into your life? Um, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah. What would you say is something you've best followed in? My best qualities? Just that I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What do you mean by qualities? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay. I think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay, bye. Can I take her home with me? Is she, um, is she supposed to be a psychiatrist or can I hire her? Okay.",
         "I've been feeling like I'm not moving forward as fast as I want to, and it's taking longer to accomplish more goals than I thought it would. It's kind of hard sometimes. I experience mood swings all the time, even yesterday or today. I can get angry easily, just snap over something small, and it's really hard to control my temper, especially when I'm going through unpleasant things in my life. I don't think I'll be able to control it. People can get on my nerves sometimes, which is annoying. My friends describe me as outgoing with a good sense of humor, but they understand when I'm going through something or get mad easily, though I can also laugh right after. When I was a teenager, around 14 or 15, I was very restless and destructive, and I had anger issues back then too, which have been a problem over the years. To cope, I go to the gym and work out, go to the beach, or take trips to get away for a minute. My family, especially my mother, is a big support, giving me good advice and always coming first.",

         " Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. I'm fine. This is a little bit strange, you know, talking to a virtual human. I was born, I was born in LA. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived in the city of San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I was born in LA. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived all over Los Angeles. I've lived in the valley, Long Beach, and now I'm in Culver City. Awesome. What are some things you really like about LA? There's great food here. The weather is great most of the time. There's a lot of sunshine. I think that's really great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? That is a much longer list I would like to get out of here. The traffic, I think that's number one. I think everybody hates the traffic. And everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to get together with anybody. Everybody's so devoted to their jobs and then we're sitting in traffic a lot too. Yeah. What did you study at school? I studied Marine Biology. Wow. That sounds interesting. Why did you decide to do that? I went to school and I originally studied graphic design and I found that kind of unfulfilling. So I took a trip for a while, traveled around the world, and started scuba diving. And I realized that I really loved Marine Biology. So that's how I got into it. Nice. What's your dream job? Everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since I just graduated. I think I would like to... I think maybe managing a research... I'm not really sure. I think I would like to... Something in Tropical Marine Ecology, maybe managing a preserve, something like that. It's a hard question to answer. I do. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I traveled for eight months in Central America. And I visited a lot of different countries. I... I traveled a lot. I traveled a lot. I went to different countries. I went scuba diving. Wow. What are some things that you're doing now? I think intolerance, injustice in the world. I think intolerance, injustice in the world. Those are probably the things that get me the most fired up. What do you do when you're annoyed? Brant to my boyfriend. Does that count? How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. Very few people have seen me angry. To the point where I'm kind of yelling and screaming angry. I don't know. I just don't get there. I think that I'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper, so I keep it under control. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone you loved or loved without? It was yesterday, actually. I argued with my boyfriend about getting a job. I was talking about taking a job somewhere, and he was being very supportive. I really wanted him to say, No, don't go take that job for six months because I would miss you. He was just being supportive. We kind of argued about that. It was ridiculous, so I ended up laughing. That's good. What do you do to relax? Meditate, exercise, go out in nature. Just unplug, get myself away from a computer, away from technology, away from people. Okay. How close are you to your family? I would say not really. I'm an only child, and it's just me and my parents, and we're very, very dissimilar. For example, I'm a pretty adventurous person. I like learning, and my parents are couch potatoes. They like to watch reality television. We don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activities. I love them and everything, but there's not too much common ground. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Yes. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I don't think I'm a social person. I think I'm a social person. I think I'm a social person. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I seem to find most social encounters to be draining, whereas my boyfriend, for example, he derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people. For me, it's always a little bit the opposite. I have to recharge. How are your best friends? I'm not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He's kind of my best friend. I'm not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He would probably say passionate, intelligent. He always tells me that I'm really hard on myself, which is true. Dedicated, loyal. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm just proud of who I am. I don't know if that's the answer that most people give, but I think that I'm really proud of who I am. I try really hard. I've done a lot of things in my life. I'm a really good person. I think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind, and I consider myself a kind person that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so I'm proud of that. That's so good to hear. Have you ever served in military? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I was probably about 15 at the time, so I think 17 years ago. You were very young weren't you? Yes. What got you to see the doctor? I was diagnosed with depression. I called my parents and let them know, and at that point they took me in for treatment. That wasn't the first time I had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist, but before it was more, they thought I had ADHD. So it was, I think, my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help. Do you still go to therapy now? I haven't for about three years. I was checking in with a parole officer. I just wasn't enjoying the relationship I had, but I still have a psychiatrist that I go to for med checks. That sucks. Do you feel like they're useful? I do think it's useful if you have the right therapist. I think if you don't have a good relationship with a therapist, it can be incredibly harmful. I have talked to people that have had bad experiences How have you been feeling lately? Lately I've been a little bit down. I should say a little bit more down than usual because I graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things 24-7 has come to an end. Without the routine, it's been a little bit weird finding out what to do with my... finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time. It's also been a little bit depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in California. That sounds really hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Almost impossible. Ever since I was a little kid, I had trouble falling asleep. About four years ago, it became really, really bad or I just couldn't sleep through the night. I was getting about four hours of sleep. Sometimes I would wake up every hour and I would wake up in the morning just to complete rec. For about four years, I've been taking trazodone so I can sleep. What are you looking down for these days? Have you ever seen Fight Club? You're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's pretty much like that. I'm just a complete panicked, anxious rec. I lose my ability to deal with things. I'm much more likely to lose my temper. I can't regulate my moods. I'm just really volatile. When was the last time you were happy? Probably a few months ago. I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a week, and I was just really, really happy. I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a weekend, and forgotten to take my medicine with me or something like that and then I can't sleep and so that's what happens. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy. I don't know. It's easier for me to keep track of when I feel really, really bad. Really happy. I guess I felt happy on New Year's Day and really happy on New Year's Eve, which was 10 days ago. I was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to Palm Springs and Joshua Tree and it was really nice to see them. I don't get to see them very often because I've been in school and I've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to real life. That's great. What would you say as somebody who has followed you? I think that I'm kind, I'm considerate, I'm tolerant, I'm pretty open-minded, I'm aware of my faults. I just try to be nice to everybody and I'm very curious about the world and things that I don't know about. I really like to learn. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think that I was in a relationship with my boyfriend and he was really nice to me What's one of your most memorable experiences? Off the top of my head, first thing that comes to mind is diving the blue hole in Belize. It was really amazing. It was me and my friends. We just jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this limestone sinkhole and it's really, really, really blue and you just drop down to about 140 feet in something like two minutes. We did it pretty quick, not everybody could do it that quick. As you go down, you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge, they're larger than a human because it's this cave system and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you. That was pretty good. What are some things you like to do for fun? I'm trying to remember that at the moment. I haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school. I guess reading, hiking, just being together with my friends, doing relatively low key things, going to movies, having dinner parties, cooking, playing with my cat. Is there anything you can remember? Not that I can really think of. I've made mistakes in my life, but I'm still here so it can't be that bad. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't know, hang in there. Hold on to your clothes because the 90s are coming back in fashion. What are some things that you believe have been a good way? There's someone that's been a positive influence on you. I think that's great. Especially the last year, he's really inspired me. He quit drinking, he quit smoking. He's made a lot of positive changes in his life. I know that those things aren't easy. So to see someone overcome that really inspired me. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thanks for having me.",

         "Everything isn't very well for me. I can feel agitated sometimes, especially when I'm 'off the ground,' though I wouldn't say I feel 'down.' I don't really get 'super, super happy'; I'm more 'even-minded,' 'even-kill,' and I try to stay 'pretty level.' I guess there's just no reason to get 'super, super happy.'\n\nMy hunger control varies, and when asked about it, I felt like you wouldn't really want to hear about it. It's tough for me to get into the next stage of my life, and that seems to depend on whether I'm sleeping alone or with someone. I don't visit my hometown often, preferring to just call. My social life is somewhat limited, mostly with my girlfriend, who I think is cool but a bit arrogant. I know I need to be more patient with her. I've also been told I stare down.\n\nPlaying my guitar and flying planes are things that make me feel good and are when I last felt 'really happy.' I also make an effort to go to the gym, and I was there last night. I'm persistent, and my parents have been a strong, positive influence in my life, even if I don't see them often.",

         "My depression has lasted exactly two years and two months. I've experienced loneliness and depression, especially after I didn't have any family members left in the United States. I sought help by going to a counselor and then group therapy. Group therapy has been particularly helpful because I can share my problems with others who are going through similar experiences, and we can support each other. Seeing a therapist has helped me cope with things and it's nice to have someone to talk to. I initially didn't want to admit I was depressed, but after feeling that way for so long, I knew I had to do something. Lately, I've been feeling pretty good, getting more positive and better. My sleep isn't great; it's about 50-50, some nights I sleep well, others I don't. This lack of sleep often leads to a lack of energy the next day, which is especially hard if I have two consecutive nights of no sleep. I felt really happy during the holidays a couple of weeks ago; Christmas trees and kids always make me feel good. I tend to be shy sometimes, so I stay to myself a lot.",

         " And when she's done she'll let you know, and I'm going to put the doorbell over here, and you can let me know when you're done. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions at the start, and please feel free to tell me that. Your answers are really confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty well. That's good. Where are you from originally? From New York. Really? Why did you move to LA? To go to college. Well, to San Diego to go to college, and then later to LA. Cool. What did you study at school? Aerospace engineering. That's nice. How did you decide to do that? I was really good at math and science, and I had an interest in airplanes. Are you still working on that? No. What do you do now? I'm a life coach. Cool. What's your dream job? To be a life coach and help people. Tell me more about that. I really like how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that I made a contribution to their life. That's so good to hear. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. It's great. I really like to do outdoor things, and I like doing things by the ocean. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic and how crowded it is. Do you have roommates? Yeah. How do you like your living situation? I live with my girlfriend, so I like it. How do you know them? We met on eHarmony. How close are you to them? Really close. That's great. There's someone that's been a positive influence on you. My meditation teacher. Can you tell me about that? I used to be very shy and self-conscious and have a lot of anxiety. I worry a lot about the future. I took classes, meditation and yoga classes, and it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and enjoy life a lot more. That's good. What do you do to relax? I meditate and do yoga. What are some things that you don't really like about LA? I don't get mad that often, but frustrated. I would say being stuck in traffic or people that do mean things to other people for no real reason. What do you do when you're annoyed? I usually talk to somebody about it if I can. That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? When was the last time you argued with someone? How did you feel about that? What did you do in that moment? Do you feel that way often? That's good. What are some things you like to do to find? What's one of your most memorable experiences? A trip I took to India and Nepal for six weeks. Can you travel a lot? Yeah, as much as I can. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love to explore. I've loved to explore ever since I was a little kid. I love seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures. I love backpacking in the wilderness and exploring nature. I'd love to hear about your trips. Cool. I went on a trip to India and Nepal. It was my first time ever there. The first week and a half I was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat. I went whitewater rafting on the Ganga River. Then I went off on my own for the rest of the trip. I went backpacking in Nepal with a guide there. It was really beautiful in the Annapurna area. Then I went back into India and explored the area up near Tibet. Then I went to Rajasthan and to a tiger park in Madai Pradesh. It was really close to tigers. How did you decide to do that? I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this trip. I'd always wanted to go to India. So I decided to do it. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was really fun. How are your best friends? They're caring and enthusiastic for life. That's good. Have you ever served in a military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with insomnia? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I don't sleep as well as I did when I was younger. For the most part, I sleep well. Once in a while, I'll wake up at four or five in the morning when I want to sleep until seven. I'll not be able to get back to sleep. In general, it's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I feel tired and not as motivated as usual. I sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon. Okay. Have you ever studied using a video app? No. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago? I guess, too, I wish I would have invested money or bought a house or something when I was younger. That would probably be the advice I would give myself. Okay. What would you say is one of your best qualities? I am empathetic with other people, positive and have a positive outlook on life. I'm very determined when I decide to do something. I'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging. I'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things. I guess probably the strongest thing is that I'm pretty balanced. I'm very organized but I'm also pretty creative. I'm pretty balanced that way. That's good. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. Much closer than I was when I was younger. Although I'd say I'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than I'm able to get to my family. Okay. What are some things that you do that you think are good? Being outdoors and nature and exercising and also singing. What are you most proud of in your life? The fact that I've gone with, followed my heart and done what I wanted to do versus going with what I think I should do. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? I guess yesterday. I spent the day by the beach and just bicycled and went skating and visited some old friends there. How did you feel about that? I felt very relaxed and invigorated. I also felt like I missed living by the beach because I used to live really close to the beach. I guess a little bit sad that I didn't live there anymore but really happy to be there. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Goodbye. Okay.",
         "And when she's done she'll let you know, and I'm going to put the doorbell over here, and you can let me know when you're done. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions at the start, and please feel free to tell me that. Your answers are really confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty well. That's good. Where are you from originally? From New York. Really? Why did you move to LA? To go to college. Well, to San Diego to go to college, and then later to LA. Cool. What did you study at school? Aerospace engineering. That's nice. How did you decide to do that? I was really good at math and science, and I had an interest in airplanes. Are you still working on that? No. What do you do now? I'm a life coach. Cool. What's your dream job? To be a life coach and help people. Tell me more about that. I really like how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that I made a contribution to their life. That's so good to hear. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. It's great. I really like to do outdoor things, and I like doing things by the ocean. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic and how crowded it is. Do you have roommates? Yeah. How do you like your living situation? I live with my girlfriend, so I like it. How do you know them? We met on eHarmony. How close are you to them? Really close. That's great. There's someone that's been a positive influence on you. My meditation teacher. Can you tell me about that? I used to be very shy and self-conscious and have a lot of anxiety. I worry a lot about the future. I took classes, meditation and yoga classes, and it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and enjoy life a lot more. That's good. What do you do to relax? I meditate and do yoga. What are some things that you don't really like about LA? I don't get mad that often, but frustrated. I would say being stuck in traffic or people that do mean things to other people for no real reason. What do you do when you're annoyed? I usually talk to somebody about it if I can. That's good. What's one of your most memorable experiences? A trip I took to India and Nepal for six weeks. Can you travel a lot? Yeah, as much as I can. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love to explore. I've loved to explore ever since I was a little kid. I love seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures. I love backpacking in the wilderness and exploring nature. I'd love to hear about your trips. Cool. I went on a trip to India and Nepal. It was my first time ever there. The first week and a half I was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat. I went whitewater rafting on the Ganga River. Then I went off on my own for the rest of the trip. I went backpacking in Nepal with a guide there. It was really beautiful in the Annapurna area. Then I went back into India and explored the area up near Tibet. Then I went to Rajasthan and to a tiger park in Madai Pradesh. It was really close to tigers. How did you decide to do that? I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this trip. I'd always wanted to go to India. So I decided to do it. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was really fun. How are your best friends? They're caring and enthusiastic for life. That's good. Have you ever served in a military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with insomnia? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I don't sleep as well as I did when I was younger. For the most part, I sleep well. Once in a while, I'll wake up at four or five in the morning when I want to sleep until seven. I'll not be able to get back to sleep. In general, it's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I feel tired and not as motivated as usual. I sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon. Okay. Have you ever studied using a video app? No. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago? I guess, too, I wish I would have invested money or bought a house or something when I was younger. That would probably be the advice I would give myself. Okay. What would you say is one of your best qualities? I am empathetic with other people, positive and have a positive outlook on life. I'm very determined when I decide to do something. I'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging. I'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things. I guess probably the strongest thing is that I'm pretty balanced. I'm very organized but I'm also pretty creative. I'm pretty balanced that way. That's good. How close are you to your family?

He was on drugs. So he chose, the drugs were too much problems. Yeah, it does. It's really hard. Because it's like the drugs are his mistress. How do you know that? How do I what? How do you know that? Who? Let's see now. Yes. No. No. But... Well, I don't really consider myself an introvert. Yeah. I have a lot of I have a lot of regrets. But there really wasn't anything I could do about it. So there's really no point in regretting it. Cause you do what you do and you make a decision and then it's already done so why regret it? Why bother? You know? What advice can you give yourself? Make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol. That's one for sure. That was the only question I didn't ask. I didn't know. There's a lot of things. A lot of stuff. You know? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Just the things that I can do.

And then if I can eat something really good and healthy at night time and... Well basically if I have something to do if I have a goal, somewhere to go, something to do, like today even puts me in a good mood. Yeah.

         "important I wonder if people really understand it, you know what I mean? Like if people do judge, yeah, bizarre. I did like the Ricky Lake show with my friend and I saw myself on TV. Oh my god, yeah, but I was eating candy and I was going to like that and then I was looking at Ricky Lake like there must be something around my eyes because I was like she was like right there. I don't know. And so I had to actually like act, you know, I'm in the audience but I had to like pretend like I was interested in what you have to say but I looked so I kept looking at her like that like there's something wrong my eyes. No, I just saw I was in a doctor's office and they had it on and like oh god it was funny because there was these guys like winking at me on the way out like that's celebrity and I'm like I can pay to do audience sitting there. It's like I hated every minute of it but we got sewing machines, free sewing machines, $200 sewing machines that day. It was yeah, so it was worth it but I was so embarrassed. Yeah, only if you get stuff it's worth it otherwise they're so stupid. The shows are so I can't believe that's why I don't watch television. It's so embarrassing. Okay, right on. Okay, this is so weird. Oh gosh, I hope she's nice to me. I hope so. Okay, hello. Yes, fine, just tired. California, from Hollywood. Not too much. It's not too many things I like about it. The people, it's not clean, too much crime, too many drugs. Makeup and hair is a little bit not too much. I just survived very difficult. Okay, I'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career but I just want probably to get married and have a little security, that's all. Just be a wife again. A little bit close but everybody's pretty much passed away. I play Farmville on Facebook. I'm good. I don't really have a temper. I was my ex-husband about money. People lying, cheating, conniving drug addicts, you know, just ugly people, people that are hideous in the inside, you know. Jesus Christ, that's about it. My mother when she was alive, well she still has positive influence but nobody really but Jesus. I don't know. I can't really think of one right now. Gosh, oh I guess like maybe modeling, that was pretty cool. Yeah, yeah. I was just kind of surreal like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff, you know. I didn't understand how it could have been me but then my photographer told me he was like, well someone has to do it, it might as well be you. So I will and it's true. So that was cool. Just kind of fell into it by accident. I've always I wish I did it, I took it further but I couldn't really happy. I don't remember. I really don't. I don't really have a best friend but I'm sure anybody would describe me as outgoing. Yeah, no. Yes, I was 1984. Yeah, I couldn't deal with it so I had to see a psychiatrist. Horrified, couldn't sleep, panicked, major anxiety. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes, I do. It could be if you see the right doctor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody and hopefully they can give you answers. Most of them don't. They try to find the answers inside of you, get it out of you but it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kind of bias neutral. Really depressed, extremely depressed. Yeah, poverty. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a lot more tired. I sleep longer and I am I just don't have the drive, motivation that I did before. Just try to be strong, just have to get through it, you know. Yes, yes. Not really. I'm an open book. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I would say perfectionist but that's not really a good quality because it can get dangerous. I'm just artistic. I'm really good at a lot of things but I'm a good hairdresser and makeup artist. I crochet and knit really well, make jewelry. I'm not good with computers or phones though, electronics. Yeah.

         " collection. Now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. I'm going to put the doorbell back over here. When she's done, she'll let you know and you can hit the doorbell. Okay? Alright. Okay. Yes. Very well. New York. This turned the volume up a little bit. For a change. That's good. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was about. Probably took a year or two. Well, you know, being away from my family, being away from what I was used to in New York, the neighborhoods, the people, and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here. Well, the weather. Can't beat the weather. It's generally always nice. It's not too hot. It's not too cold. It's creative. I do like movies. I like the beach. The traffic. There's a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places. I was a history major. I do demonstrations in high-end supermarkets. To be a screenwriter. That's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. It's hard because I don't always maintain focus and motivation. I let other things distract me. I've always been interested in films ever since I was a child. I just always was writing and had an active imagination. In the last probably almost ten years I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well, I've always traveled, even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So, yes. Seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am. Seeing how they live and taking in the sights. I went to Kenya. That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on. On the safari and just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible. Oh yeah, that's one of the great experiences of my life. I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called Charmel Shake, which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world, which is hard to believe that Egypt would, but it was just amazing. I didn't go scuba diving. I went snorkeling. What do I do to relax? I like to listen to music. I like to watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of whatever might be on my mind. I do meditate every day. I like to take walks in nature that's always calming, especially down by the ocean. It depends. Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper. A lot of times I'll do a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself, which is something I've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. Also, since I meditate, I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past. Some things that make me really mad. I guess I think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along and make the world better. What was the last thing you argued with someone? Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film and I didn't think it was done very well. We had a fun argument about the movie. That just happened yesterday, so that's on my mind. Is there anything you regret? Is there anything I regret? Yeah, there have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued them. Certain jobs. When I first got to Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to become a GRIP and I probably should have pursued that. How did I decide to do that? I don't really understand the questions. Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important and no matter how you feel, you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do. No, but I've been depressed in my life. For the most part, I've been feeling good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. Sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down. I can usually get out of it pretty quickly. Sometimes financial concerns, sometimes an opportunity, how do I explain it? Financial is one way that if I made another decision, I might have more money or my life would be different. Not really. I feel pretty much the same. What got me to seek help for? Let's come back to that. Generally, talking to someone has helped when I did do that. Pretty easy. I don't have problems sleeping. Usually I'm grumpy. If I don't sleep well, I feel tired and irritable. How would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier. I think it's tough, it depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write, so that means that I have to spend time alone. When I come out of that, I'm extroverted. I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood. My best qualities. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likeable personality. People have said that. I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's a cool detachment. I'm creative, intuitive. Yes. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy. I had breakfast, I was happy. Sun was shining. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I do remember snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun, the powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond, almost beyond like human in a way. Just more in touch with everything, the universe. It would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day, but... What am I most proud of in my life? I think I've helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, I've written some screenplays, I've had some good relationships. Good relationships, just being connected with someone else, spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels. It could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something. If I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive, it puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye bye. Sometimes she would ask me, it would sort of tweak, and then it would ask me this question about not being able to do it. I don't remember it really getting specific like that. Oh, like what? Do you remember what question you're talking about? It kind of asks me, well, are you depressed? Sometimes. It will explain that, and then it was like, well... Then it did something, and then it was like, well... Did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, we... There was no bridge to that conversation. Got it, got it.",

Financial is one way that if I made another decision, I might have more money or my life would be different. Not really. I feel pretty much the same. What got me to seek help for? Let's come back to that. Generally, talking to someone has helped when I did do that. Pretty easy. I don't have problems sleeping. Usually I'm grumpy. If I don't sleep well, I feel tired and irritable. How would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier. I think it's tough, it depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write, so that means that I have to spend time alone. When I come out of that, I'm extroverted. I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood. My best qualities. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likeable personality. People have said that. I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's a cool detachment. I'm creative, intuitive. Yes. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy. I had breakfast, I was happy. Sun was shining. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I do remember snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun, the powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond like human in a way. Just more in touch with everything, the universe. It would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day, but... What am I most proud of in my life? I think I've helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, I've written some screenplays, I've had some good relationships. Just being connected with someone else, spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels. It could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something. If I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive, it puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye bye. Sometimes she would ask me, it would sort of tweak, and then it would ask me this question about not being able to do it. I don't remember it really getting specific like that. Oh, like what? Do you remember what question you're talking about? It kind of asks me, well, are you depressed? Sometimes. It will explain that, and then it was like, well... Then it did something, and then it was like, well... Did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, we... There was no bridge to that conversation. Got it, got it.",
         "I've been depressed in my life, though for the most part, I've been feeling good recently. Sometimes I feel a little blue. If I allow a regret to come into my mind, like missed opportunities or different financial decisions, that can really bring me down, but I can usually get out of it pretty quickly. Financial concerns are a specific trigger that can make me feel this way.\n\nWhen I'm feeling down, it's hard for me to maintain focus and motivation, and I let other things distract me, especially with my goal of being a screenwriter. My sleep is generally pretty easy; I don't usually have problems sleeping, but if I don't sleep well, I feel tired and irritable, and can be grumpy. My best friend would probably say they'd like to see me a little happier.\n\nTo cope, talking to someone has helped when I've done that. I also use strategies like listening to music, watching movies to take my mind off things, meditating daily, and taking walks in nature, especially by the ocean, which is calming. I've also learned self-hypnosis to calm myself, which is very helpful, especially when I get angry or lose my temper. Since I meditate, I don't get annoyed as easily as I used to.",

Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are welcome. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from a suburb of LA, from the San Gabriel Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity of the city. I've lived other places and it's just not as happy here. I feel like I can really thrive here. So I just like LA. Like all the things that are so close together. And there's a lot of interesting things that are totally different parts of the city, just miles away from each other. Yeah. I see. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. I don't like all the cars. But I can live with it. There's not that much I don't like. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied music, vocal performance, I studied music technology, things like that. Awesome. Are you still working on that? Yes. What do you do now? Right now I sing at an opera company. But I do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the LA Opera. So I do have a day job. I work at a call center. They cater mostly to performers and actors and things like that. It's really good because if I get a call, I can call in and change my shift very easily. So it's actually a pretty good gig. I do some technology gigs sometimes. I do some recording, some live sound stuff. But I kind of want to get away from that. I do some video work sometimes. But again, I want to get away from that. I want to go back to the... Because I find that performing is more interesting. I like being talent more than I like being crew. So I kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Sometimes. I mean, for my personal life, yeah. I do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people. But if I'm at home, I'd kind of rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever. I don't have too many close friends. But yeah, you know, I'd rather keep to myself. How close are you to your family? I'm moderately close to the family that I have left. I've actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so. Thank you. But I'm close to my husband. You know, I've got a couple of cousins I talk to and my aunt that I have an aunt that I talk to a bit. But it's not like we're interacting every day close together. But it's somewhat close. Okay. What do you do to relax? Mostly I sing or I read or I write or just hang out and try to... I hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in. And sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things, contacting my family, you know, through Facebook or whatever works. But mostly in my free time I create things. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I'd like to travel more. I like to travel by car a lot. I mean, my idea of having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. And I'd like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Particularly traveling by car, seeing the landscape change, seeing people change, feeling the vibrations of the area change. I like just seeing what's out there. And I know that there's a bigger world outside of where I am and where I live and my world. I like to see that. But I like to leave that too and go back to my own world. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Um, let's see. I think a trip that I like to take is to make the drive from here to Nevada, whether I go all the way to Vegas or just go to State Line. My cousin and I would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway, you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway. So we would take those. We just sort of impromptu with a day or two notice, just move things around, just take off. So those are actually trips that I like to make because I take off and then just come back. Sometimes the same day, sometimes overnight. Just small, short trips that aren't very involved, but you just get to go and you see things and see how, um, you know, the desert landscape looks in different seasons, how people react in different times of the year in different areas. So close to home, but not, but not close to home, close to home, but still a world away. So that because I don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever, but it's just little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head and things like that. I mean, because there's sort of a sense of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway. So I like doing that. The last time that happened was May of last year. So last time I was able to do that. We actually, my aunt came over with my cousin who's 10 years younger than I am. And we kind of grew up like sisters. And I was about to move away from the Inland Empire, which is where they live. So they kind of took me on a last hurrah. We drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while, but I didn't like it. So they kind of, I showed them some of the local sites around there and we came back and was, you know, an overnight trip, but we're driving the entire time. That's kind of interesting. Things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals or people who can't fight back. They're mean to them just because they can't fight back. And I actually like to see people who are as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you. So I think that's one thing that makes me really mad. Just being cruel or mean for no reason. You know, not for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it. That kind of really just makes me mad. When I'm annoyed, I'll try to just walk away from the situation. And if the situation is just unfollowing me, then I'll wind up lashing out somehow, either verbally just cutting them with a quip or, you know, I rarely will yell at somebody. But I'll try to, you know, if I try to walk away and defuse it, if that doesn't work, then I'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me. That usually works. Not like legal trouble or anything, because usually I'll find a way to get them to leave me alone. There's not really like big trouble, but I think because it is off-putting and it's not the expected reaction. And that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that will work and get people away from me. So it's not really in trouble. And if it is trouble, it's usually trouble that it's from the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because due to the situation I can get out of. So as long as they leave me alone, you know, I'll walk away from it. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody, like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my... What was that in your mind? The last thing I could think of was I argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law because she's got dementia. And so one of the reasons we came out here from the Inland Empire was to take care of her because she won't go anywhere but LA. I mean, she's like hardcore Angelino. We know we are that, we're that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere. But so we came out here to take care of her and he wants her to be able to stay in her apartment. And I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us. But she wants to stay where she is because she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process. But he wants her to stay where she... He wants her to be able to have what she wants because he's a mama's boy like I am. I'm a mama's girl. Even though I lost my mom like four years ago, I'm still a mama's girl. And I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much. That's what they want. So you want to get it for them. And because they, you know, that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it. And you want to do that for them now, like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about, somebody you feel deserves it. But it's kind of dangerous for her, you know, and I don't want this thing to happen to her. Yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as she can. Because I know the disease that she has is going to erase who she is eventually. And eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her 24 hour medically trained care. But until then, we can handle it amongst ourselves. It's not that bad. But it's getting worse. She really has no business living by herself anymore. So the solution right now is he stays there most of the time with her. And I go back to our house. And it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I do I handle the outside things. I run the errands. I take her to the store, things like that. He does the day to day things, make sure she has she eats, make sure she, you know, has clean clothes, things like that. So, I mean, it's a partnership. It's a it's a dual effort. It's very much a dual effort. But I would like her to move in with us. So that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling, screaming argument, but lively discussion, you know, and debate. It's not insurmountable. I mean, life's not going to be easy ever. And if it is, it's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life, it's not going to be easy. But you deal with it and you move on. The most positive influence, I think, have been probably my mother and my grandmother, because my mom was pretty much a single mom. And my grandmother helped raise me. And they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it. So, I mean, I think I have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperament to myself. But they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that, you know, life's going to go on. You know, my mom would say to me, when you're 40, you're 40, whether you're working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life. I think that was a big influence on how I've lived my life since she's passed. I regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have clouded some of my decisions. Now, I do have underlying conditions. Everybody in my family is diabetic, and I didn't take care of that when she was the last year for life because I was too busy wanting to get her home. My focus was to get her home. So I didn't eat right. I didn't take my insulin right. I wanted to make myself insulin resistant that year just because my blood sugar was so high for like a year. Eating just horrible foods when I did eat. So it really took a toll and it really actually made myself very sick. And I'm wondering, well, if I didn't, if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straight, my vision and my thoughts weren't completely weren't clouded. Would I have made some better decisions on her behalf, especially when she needed them? When she needed me to be to step in and make this his for because she wound up having a health catastrophe because she had kidney, she had kidney damage. I want to be kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that. So she wanted having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. She wanted having a stroke at like 50. She had a small stroke and it just kind of went down from there. So I'm thinking, well, if I didn't, if I had taken care of better care of myself, would I have been able to take better care of her? And I know there wasn't anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death. But what if I if I would I have been able to make it easier on her? If I would have taken care of myself. That's like one huge regret that I have. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Oh, I know I am. But it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And I know other people, I can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings. And they can't, you know, be what I want them to be. And I know they're not going to be. But I still have, you know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to. Fit into my life in a way in the best way possible. But I know because they're other beings. And I'm not going to be able to do that for them. Then I can be able to do that for me. But it's still by ideals. So I have to sometimes have to look at and go, well, is this what I want? Because I want it or what is what they want and what's there is their decision or mine and it's theirs. I know it's there. So if you really care about somebody, you're just going to support them and go with them. But it's still kind of hard for me. And I know I got to get over it. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago. Probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because I went up taking care of my mother. I mean, she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college and I had a job lined up and I had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her. I think I would have been more aggressive about starting my own life, getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her, getting my own job history, my own credit history, things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years. So I think I probably would have done that. But to myself, just do that and keep who you are and learn to separate. You who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of yourself. That's probably what I would have and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself. That's probably the advice I would give myself 10 years ago. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, but probably because I haven't gone to a doctor about it because I don't want to know. I mean, it's not, I know there have been times in my life where I've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it, but I'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. Can you give me an example of that? After my mother had died, it had been this long battle for a year that we lost. I didn't know if I was to blame for that. It's like logically I knew I wasn't, but how could I convince myself of that? Two weeks after she died, I wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because I didn't take care of myself for a year. I feel, oh, I'm 30 years old. If, you know, whatever I do to myself, I can get over. No, turns out no. But I wound up having to take more medication because of that. It's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter. All of a sudden I didn't. It's like the rug was pulled out. My like bottom fell out of my world after that. So that was the pretty pretty much sent me into a deep depression. I'm I almost got divorced because of it because I just didn't want anything anymore. So I was being really distant from my husband by then. At that time, we were married for about two years at that point, and I started getting very distant from him, just pushing everything away, just, you know, figuring out what am I going to do with the rest of my life now? And it's been a fight. And there are times when, no, I couldn't get up. Just stay in bed and sleep all day. You know, but then you realize that when my mother died, I had forecast look after two are mine to rehearse. I mean, well, they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own, you know, own supplies. I took that responsibility of doing it for them. So that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them. I mean, I could go without eating. I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't. They didn't, you know, so they actually got me up and. And made me go out and face things, even though I didn't want to, just didn't just kind of want to curl up and die. But that would have been my choice, not theirs. And they I mean, what would happen to them if I wasn't there to take care of them? They would have been, you know, sent to a shelter or whatever, probably. And maybe they would have not been re adopt me home and adopted by somebody else. Maybe they would have been killed for for me. I mean, for me making selfish decisions. So it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed. And that's actually been a motivating factor is to take because I figured out that it was just me. I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff. I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted. It wouldn't be a big deal. I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life. But I have a family to look after now. So I have to go out and do things. You know, I have to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day, day job. I have to, you know, but I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what I want to do with my life. But yet I have to take care of my family. Some work on a balance of the two. Very. But it's worth it. I mean, it would be very I'd have a lot less things to worry about if I just lived in my car and said, forget it. But keeping a residence down, paying bills, things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it. You know, if you want you want any if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through that. And I know that. But it gets hard. Sometimes you do want to give up. But then it's like, well, what's the alternative? I mean, I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did, I wouldn't do anything. I have to be slightly uncomfortable or I'm not going to do anything with myself. I'm just going to be content. Just hang out all day, stay in bed, hang out with my cats or whatever. And I wouldn't get anything done. I see. How do you even feel? Very anxious and nervous. And I mean, what if. I don't find enough, you know, enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever. What if? You know, what if I can't. Keep. Assemblance of stability in my life, and it's actually hard work to be stable. And I know it's hard work to be stable, but what you know, it's just a lot of what ifs. And I don't think it's things that haven't happened. And it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened. And I know that, but it's still have it still creeps in. So that's actually a source of. Anxiety. The internal anxiety go by getting things done, figuring things out, making a solid plan and going for it. But I know it's a cycle and I'll go from being really anxious and oh, my God, what am I going to do? What am I going to do? Just saying, OK, what is. The fundamental thing I need to take care of here. I mean, what is just extraneous and what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue? And so. Figure out how to figure things out that way. And then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit, but then something will pop up and the what ifs will come up again. I'll have to. Figure it out again, but I know it's a cycle. I know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it, you get over it pretty quickly. You get through it. The last time I felt really happy. I don't know. Like. Huh. Good question. But that actually surprisingly stumped me. Because I do feel happy sometimes, sometimes not so much. Sometimes it's kind of in the middle. Really like over joyously happy. I don't know. I have not. I can't think of when that happened. I don't know. I don't know. You don't know perceptions of other people. I mean. Probably as somebody who. Oddly enough, somebody who is laid back and you know. Handle things as they come, but I don't see myself as that at all. And so it. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to. Hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to to survive and get things done. That. And I can do it creatively and I try to. Strive for balance. Probably. Probably the best things about me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? That I'm doing basically what I want with my life, which even though it's not all easy, it's not. I'm not financially well off or anything. It's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives because I have an aunt that I really don't talk to who and the reason why I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable. I mean, she's got a career that she. It's more of a job that she fell into. Because my older aunt loves animals, but didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it. She had a stable business for a long time. But her, you know, she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had actually my cousin's father. Actually, my cousin's father went and kind of stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business. And she kind of she retired early because between that and the arthritis, she wanted retiring early. She employed my younger aunt, who is still a dog groomer, but she hates it. And it's like change your life. If you hate your life so much, change it. And I think the thing I'm most proud of is. Yeah, I'm not as financially well off as she is, but I'm doing what I want with my life. You know, I can be creative. I can have creative people around me, people who I actually like to talk to around me. People I actually like in my life and be happy with that. And I see a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say I'm not like that. That I'm actually doing what I want, even though there are sacrifices. I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you.",

What do you do to relax? Mostly I sing or I read or I write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in. And sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things, contacting my family, you know, through Facebook or whatever works. But mostly in my free time I create things. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I'd like to travel more. I like to travel by car a lot. I mean, my idea of having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. And I'd like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Particularly traveling by car, seeing the landscape change, seeing people change, feeling the vibrations of the area change. I like just seeing what's out there. And I know that there's a bigger world outside of where I am and where I live and my world. I like to see that. But I like to leave that too and go back to my own world. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Um, let's see. I think a trip that I like to take is to make the drive from here to Nevada, whether I go all the way to Vegas or just go to State Line. My cousin and I would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway, you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway. So we would take those. We just sort of impromptu with a day or two notice, just move things around, just take off. So those are actually trips that I like to make because I take off and then just come back. Sometimes the same day, sometimes overnight. Just small, short trips that aren't very involved, but you just get to go and you see things and see how, um, you know, the desert landscape looks in different seasons, how people react in different times of the year in different areas. So close to home, but still a world away. Because I don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever, but it's just little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head and things like that. I mean, because there's sort of a sense of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway. So I like doing that. The last time that happened was May of last year. So last time I was able to do that. We actually, my aunt came over with my cousin who's 10 years younger than I am. And we kind of grew up like sisters. And I was about to move away from the Inland Empire, which is where they live. So they kind of took me on a last hurrah. We drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while, but I didn't like it. So they kind of, I showed them some of the local sites around there and we came back and was, you know, an overnight trip, but we're driving the entire time. That's kind of interesting. Things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals or people who can't fight back. They're mean to them just because they can't fight back. And I actually like to see people who are as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you. So I think that's one thing that makes me really mad. Just being cruel or mean for no reason. You know, not for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it. That kind of really just makes me mad. When I'm annoyed, I'll try to just walk away from the situation. And if the situation is just unfollowing me, then I'll wind up lashing out somehow, either verbally just cutting them with a quip or, you know, I rarely will yell at somebody. But I'll try to, you know, if I try to walk away and defuse it, if that doesn't work, then I'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me. That usually works. Not like legal trouble or anything, because usually I'll find a way to get them to leave me alone. There's not really like big trouble, but I think because it is off-putting and it's not the expected reaction. And that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that will work and get people away from me. So it's not really in trouble. And if it is trouble, it's usually trouble that it's from the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because due to the situation I can get out of. So as long as they leave me alone, you know, I'll walk away from it. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody, like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my... What was that in your mind? The last thing I could think of was I argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law because she's got dementia. And so one of the reasons we came out here from the Inland Empire was to take care of her because she won't go anywhere but LA. I mean, she's like hardcore Angelino. We know we are that, we're that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere. But so we came out here to take care of her and he wants her to be able to stay in her apartment. And I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us. But she wants to stay where she is because she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process. But he wants her to be able to have what she wants because he's a mama's boy like I am. I'm a mama's girl. Even though I lost my mom like four years ago, I'm still a mama's girl. And I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much. That's what they want. So you want to get it for them. And because they, you know, that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it. And you want to do that for them now, like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about, somebody you feel deserves it. But it's kind of dangerous for her, you know, and I don't want this thing to happen to her. Yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as she can. Because I know the disease that she has is going to erase who she is eventually. And eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her 24 hour medically trained care. But until then, we can handle it amongst ourselves. It's not that bad. But it's getting worse. She really has no business living by herself anymore. So the solution right now is he stays there most of the time with her. And I go back to our house. And it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I handle the outside things. I run the errands. I take her to the store, things like that. He does the day to day things, make sure she eats, make sure she, you know, has clean clothes, things like that. So, I mean, it's a partnership. It's a dual effort. It's very much a dual effort. But I would like her to move in with us. So that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling, screaming argument, but lively discussion, you know, and debate. It's not insurmountable. I mean, life's not going to be easy ever. And if it is, it's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life, it's not going to be easy. But you deal with it and you move on. The most positive influence, I think, have been probably my mother and my grandmother, because my mom was pretty much a single mom. And my grandmother helped raise me. And they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it. So, I mean, I think I have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperament to myself. But they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that, you know, life's going to go on. You know, my mom would say to me, when you're 40, you're 40, whether you're working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life. I think that was a big influence on how I've lived my life since she's passed. I regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have clouded some of my decisions. Now, I do have underlying conditions. Everybody in my family is diabetic, and I didn't take care of that when she was the last year for life because I was too busy wanting to get her home. My focus was to get her home. So I didn't eat right. I didn't take my insulin right. I wanted to make myself insulin resistant that year just because my blood sugar was so high for like a year. Eating just horrible foods when I did eat. So it really took a toll and it really actually made myself very sick. And I'm wondering, well, if I didn't, if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straight, my vision and my thoughts weren't completely clouded. Would I have made some better decisions on her behalf, especially when she needed them? When she needed me to step in and make this his for because she wound up having a health catastrophe because she had kidney damage. I want to be kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that. So she wanted having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. She wanted having a stroke at like 50. She had a small stroke and it just kind of went down from there. So I'm thinking, well, if I didn't, if I had taken care of better care of myself, would I have been able to take better care of her? And I know there wasn't anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death. But what if I would I have been able to make it easier on her? If I would have taken care of myself. That's like one huge regret that I have. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Oh, I know I am. But it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And I know other people, I can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings. And they can't, you know, be what I want them to be. And I know they're not going to be. But I still have, you know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to. Fit into my life in a way in the best way possible. But I know because they're other beings. And I'm not going to be able to do that for them. Then I can be able to do that for me. But it's still by ideals. So I sometimes have to look at and go, well, is this what I want? Because I want it or what is what they want and what's there is their decision or mine and it's theirs. I know it's there. So if you really care about somebody, you're just going to support them and go with them. But it's still kind of hard for me. And I know I got to get over it. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago. Probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because I went up taking care of my mother. I mean, she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college and I had a job lined up and I had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her. I think I would have been more aggressive about starting my own life, getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her, getting my own job history, my own credit history, things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years. So I think I probably would have done that. But to myself, just do that and keep who you are and learn to separate who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of yourself. Do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself. That's probably the advice I would give myself 10 years ago. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, but probably because I haven't gone to a doctor about it because I don't want to know. I mean, it's not, I know there have been times in my life where I've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it, but I'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. Can you give me an example of that? After my mother had died, it had been this long battle for a year that we lost. I didn't know if I was to blame for that. It's like logically I knew I wasn't, but how could I convince myself of that? Two weeks after she died, I wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because I didn't take care of myself for a year. I feel, oh, I'm 30 years old. If, you know, whatever I do to myself, I can get over. No, turns out no. But I wound up having to take more medication because of that. It's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter. All of a sudden I didn't. It's like the rug was pulled out. My bottom fell out of my world after that. So that was pretty much sent me into a deep depression. I almost got divorced because of it because I just didn't want anything anymore. So I was being really distant from my husband by then. At that time, we were married for about two years at that point, and I started getting very distant from him, just pushing everything away, just, you know, figuring out what am I going to do with the rest of my life now? And it's been a fight. And there are times when, no, I couldn't get up. Just stay in bed and sleep all day. You know, but then you realize that when my mother died, I had forecast look after two are mine to rehearse. I mean, well, they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own supplies. I took that responsibility of doing it for them. So that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them. I mean, I could go without eating. I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't. They didn't, you know, so they actually got me up and. And made me go out and face things, even though I didn't want to, just kind of want to curl up and die. But that would have been my choice, not theirs. And what would happen to them if I wasn't there to take care of them? They would have been, you know, sent to a shelter or whatever, probably. And maybe they would have not been re adopt me home and adopted by somebody else. Maybe they would have been killed for me. I mean, for me making selfish decisions. So it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed. And that's actually been a motivating factor is to take because I figured out that it was just me. I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff. I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted. It wouldn't be a big deal. I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life. But I have a family to look after now. So I have to go out and do things. You know, I have to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day job. I have to, you know, but I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what I want to do with my life. But yet I have to take care of my family. Some work on a balance of the two. Very. But it's worth it. I mean, I'd have a lot less things to worry about if I just lived in my car and said, forget it. But keeping a residence down, paying bills, things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it. You know, if you want any if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through that. And I know that. But it gets hard. Sometimes you do want to give up. But then it's like, well, what's the alternative? I mean, I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did, I wouldn't do anything. I have to be slightly uncomfortable or I'm not going to do anything with myself. I'm just going to be content. Just hang out all day, stay in bed, hang out with my cats or whatever. And I wouldn't get anything done. I see. How do you even feel? Very anxious and nervous. And I mean, what if. I don't find enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever. What if? You know, what if I can't. Keep. Assemblance of stability in my life, and it's actually hard work to be stable. And I know it's hard work to be stable, but what you know, it's just a lot of what ifs. And I don't think it's things that haven't happened. And it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened. And I know that, but it still creeps in. So that's actually a source of. Anxiety. The internal anxiety go by getting things done, figuring things out, making a solid plan and going for it. But I know it's a cycle and I'll go from being really anxious and oh, my God, what am I going to do? Just saying, OK, what is. The fundamental thing I need to take care of here. I mean, what is just extraneous and what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue? And so. Figure out how to figure things out that way. And then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit, but then something will pop up and the what ifs will come up again. I'll have to. Figure it out again, but I know it's a cycle. I know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it, you get over it pretty quickly. You get through it. The last time I felt really happy. I don't know. Like. Huh. Good question. But that actually surprisingly stumped me. Because I do feel happy sometimes, sometimes not so much. Sometimes it's kind of in the middle. Really like over joyously happy. I don't know. I have not. I can't think of when that happened. I don't know. You don't know perceptions of other people. I mean. Probably as oddly enough, somebody who is laid back and you know. Handle things as they come, but I don't see myself as that at all. And so it. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to. Hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to to survive and get things done. That. And I can do it creatively and I try to. Strive for balance. Probably the best things about me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? That I'm doing basically what I want with my life, which even though it's not all easy, it's not. I'm not financially well off or anything. It's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives because I have an aunt that I really don't talk to and the reason why I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable. I mean, she's got a career that she. It's more of a job that she fell into. Because my older aunt loves animals, but didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it. She had a stable business for a long time. But her, you know, she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had actually my cousin's father went and kind of stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business. And she kind of retired early because between that and the arthritis, she wanted retiring early. She employed my younger aunt, who is still a dog groomer, but she hates it. And it's like change your life. If you hate your life so much, change it. And I think the thing I'm most proud of is. Yeah, I'm not as financially well off as she is, but I'm doing what I want with my life. You know, I can be creative. I can have creative people around me, people who I actually like to talk to around me. People I actually like in my life and be happy with that. And I see a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say I'm not like that. That I'm actually doing what I want, even though there are sacrifices. I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you.",

She's going to chat with me for a bit, and then when she's done she'll let you know and I'll give you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're done. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Hi, I'm Ellie. I just created a topic in the morning, and it's called, I'm not a dancer, but I'm here to learn about people and I'm glad that I'm here. I like the new fashion and the new fashion. And you can still see me in the video. Can you see me? I'm really comfortable with it. Are you going to be able to see me? Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from? I'm from Los Angeles, California. Really? What do you think you really like about LA? Wow, wonderful weather, outdoor activities all the time. What are you studying over there? Too crowded pollution. The norm. Okay. What do you study at school? I study child communications. Recently I just, I would say yes. Preschool teacher. Well, I've always worked with children ever since I was 18 years old. So I figured doing something helping someone. It doesn't pay well, but you're investing in the future. Wow. Some job that I could get paid to be outside all day. Get paid well to be outside all day. Yes. I'm kind of quiet, but I also like, I probably would say borderline. I like outside activities, but I mainly kind of do activities probably by myself. So yeah, I would say I'm an introvert slightly. Wow. Just maybe a racist or disrespectful person. I kind of shut down and reevaluate how I am as a person, how I'm coming off to other people. I can't change anyone else's personality, but I can work on my own. You're pretty good. I usually argue with people I usually walk away. I mean, an argument doesn't settle anything. Wow. So a lot of things I regret, but it's not anything that I can control. Probably the biggest regret was losing my mother. Thank you. I was extremely close to my mother. That was who I am as a person who made me as a person. Wow. 2010 years ago I would tell myself not to be so angry, so upset all the time about things I can't control. I would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself. Pretty cool. I think you should have different avenues to deal with different people. No, I have not. No, I have not. Yes. I realized I have to evaluate myself as a person, so I can't really look to anyone else to help me unless I start with myself. No, I don't. I feel like as a person, as an individual, I feel like I should be able to control things myself. I feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else. It probably is very good for other people. I've worked with that population of PTSD veterans before, so I know that it helps a lot of people, but I don't feel like it's for me. It's not difficult at all. I've always been alone or someone who tries to handle my own problems and situations. I'm a little depressed, but I think everyone has a little bit of sadness in them at some point. Day by day, day by day, I just started an exercise program, so I'm trying to look at myself for the solution. I've always known, ever since I was a child, things move me differently than other kids, so I felt like I was always different. I felt like if I was going to ever understand me as a person, then I would have to work on myself. Okay. When was the longest time you felt really happy? Today. I got to see my best friend after a long time. I mean, happiness comes and goes, but I felt happy today. That's great. How are your best friends? Wow. He would say really silly, but still, when I'm around him, I try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy. No one wants to be around a depressed person. Wow. I mean, on certain days, everything could be my best quality, but I would say I'm loyal, I'm dependable. I would just say I try to be there in the moment. I'm not a person who is really flashy or into materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded. Can someone tell me about your mother? Oh, my mother. By far, my sister. Can you tell me about that? My mom was a school teacher, which made me want to become a school teacher, and that's basically what I have been doing. My sister has been at her job for 40 years, so I've always had a stable influence in my life. What is your favorite thing about your mother? Wow. I would say just sitting on a sunny, nice day talking to my mother, I would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately. How do you feel about your mother? Wonderful. Wonderful. What is your favorite thing about your mother? I like to get out and play sports. I play four or five different sports, and I like to go for a walk. I like to ride my bike. I like to get out and be active. What's good? What are you learning from your mother? Having such a wonderful mother. I mean, I have to keep going back to that subject, because we're introduced into this life, and that's our first teacher. That's our first teacher, and it's going to be our teacher for a very long time. I'm just very thankful. I'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother. How did you get so into your mother's life? Riding my bike. Simple things. Going for a walk with my sister, exercising. When was the last time you talked to her? Just last Sunday. That's good. Okay, I think I know what I'm saying. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Well, thank you. Bye. Wow. That was too scary. That was too many glasses.",

I felt like if I was going to ever understand me as a person, then I would have to work on myself. Okay. When was the longest time you felt really happy? Today. I got to see my best friend after a long time. I mean, happiness comes and goes, but I felt happy today. That's great. How are your best friends? Wow. He would say really silly, but still, when I'm around him, I try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy. No one wants to be around a depressed person. Wow. I mean, on certain days, everything could be my best quality, but I would say I'm loyal, I'm dependable. I would just say I try to be there in the moment. I'm not a person who is really flashy or into materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded. Can someone tell me about your mother? Oh, my mother. By far, my sister. Can you tell me about that? My mom was a school teacher, which made me want to become a school teacher, and that's basically what I have been doing. My sister has been at her job for 40 years, so I've always had a stable influence in my life. What is your favorite thing about your mother? Wow. I would say just sitting on a sunny, nice day talking to my mother, I would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately. How do you feel about your mother? Wonderful. What is your favorite thing about your mother? I like to get out and play sports. I play four or five different sports, and I like to go for a walk. I like to ride my bike. I like to get out and be active. What are you learning from your mother? Having such a wonderful mother. I mean, I have to keep going back to that subject, because we're introduced into this life, and that's our first teacher, and it's going to be our teacher for a very long time. I'm just very thankful. I'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother. How did you get so into your mother's life? Riding my bike. Simple things. Going for a walk with my sister, exercising. When was the last time you talked to her? Just last Sunday. That's good. Okay, I think I know what I'm saying. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Well, thank you. Bye.",
         "I'm a little depressed, though I believe everyone experiences some sadness. I'm generally quiet and an introvert, preferring to do activities by myself. When faced with disrespect, I tend to shut down. I often walk away from arguments because they don't settle anything. A major regret and a significant source of pain for me was losing my mother; she was extremely close to me and shaped who I am. Looking back, 2010 years ago I would tell myself not to be so angry and upset all the time about things I can't control, and to relax and not be so hard on myself. I've always felt different, even as a child, sensing that things affected me differently than others. I believe I need to evaluate myself and handle my own problems; I don't feel professional help is for me, even though I know it helps others like PTSD veterans. I've always been someone who tries to manage my own situations. Day by day, I'm working on myself and recently started an exercise program as a solution. When I'm with my best friend, I try to be happy and present a positive situation because I know no one wants to be around a depressed person. Happiness comes and goes for me.",

         " I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. And when she sends, she'll let you know. I'll put the doorbell over here. You can let me know when she sends. Okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in San Bernardino, California. Really? Yes. Where do you live? I'm staying with a sister in North Hollywood. What's it like for you living with them? She makes it as comfortable as possible. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. And the air is so nice. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. And the entertainment. And the public transportation. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's very difficult to find full-time employment. And some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the South. Because I lived in the South before. And those are the only two things. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. What did you study at school? I was an English major in college. Are you still working on that? I haven't finished. Yes, I am. What's your dream job? I'd like to be a recording singer. Really? Yes. When did you decide to do that? I've always loved to sing from the time that I was a child. Do you consider yourself an introvert? At times. Can you tell me about that? When I'm alone, I am extremely... I guess I would say... Inter-minded. I have a lot of thoughts and I keep them to myself. So if I'm in that mode, then I don't really interact with people. But I can also interact with people if I change modes. Okay. Okay, listen. What do you do to relax? I've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago. Cool. When was the last time that happened? Last week on Thursday. No, on Tuesday. What do you do when you're annoyed? Usually I just try to remain quiet and listen to the situation, if it's a person or if it's a situation that I'm dealing with myself that's annoying. I try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better. Come up with alternate plans so I won't be annoyed. How are you able to control your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I may have had an argument a few weeks ago just about timeliness. Meeting on time and showing up on time. It was actually last Monday. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To just be cautious of people's intentions. And to listen really well because people usually tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it. How would your best friend describe you? A good listener. Patient. Fun. Loving. Generous. Depressed sometimes. But generally a good person. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Within a year and a half ago. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? I just knew that I often thought about situations that happened in the past and kind of blamed the situation for my future. Can you verify something? Certain settings. Can you tell me about that? If I see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when I was younger when things happened and changed my future plans. So I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time. Do you still go to therapy now? I do. Is going to therapy helping you? I'd like to believe that it does. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? I don't worry as much. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues relieves me of the tension of holding them inside. So that's how it's helped me. How hard is that? At first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it actually is good because I know that when things are occurring if I'm able to communicate about them with a certain individual it relieves me of the stress of trying to figure out everything alone. And oftentimes by speaking about the issues it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because I'm hearing myself speak of the issue. Are you happy you did that? Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm planning things and if I'm planning things it affects my sleep. I might wake up in the middle of the night. So sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Irritable. Just very irritable. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? I was feeling anxious but now I'm calmer. Today I don't but I have in the past week. I was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so I was becoming anxious. Thank you. Yes. Maybe in October. When my mother first came she came to visit me in October and when she first got here we had a good time. The first couple of days. So I was happy to see her. I hadn't seen her in over a year. I'm proud that I'm able to adjust to different situations. The older I've gotten the more adaptable I am in different environments and different situations. I've learned how to be more resourceful. So I'm proud of that. I'm sorry? My dad, my sister, she's positive because she's finished her master's degree. My mom sometimes. My best friend is very positive because she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it. So that's an inspiration. When someone lies consistently. I listen very very well. Sometimes I give good advice. I'm a good friend. I normally do the things that I say I'm going to do so I'm dependable. I communicate well and I enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods. Being around positive people. Music puts me in a good mood. Comedy shows put me in a good mood. Good food puts me in a good mood. When I graduated from high school. It was a really, I will never forget it. It was a wonderful day. Very confident, accomplished and I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future. You're welcome. Bye. Thank you.",

         "My best friend sometimes describes me as depressed, and I do experience that sometimes. Lately, I've been feeling anxious, especially in the past week, because I've been trying to find a stable place to live, and it's been taking a long time. When I don't sleep well, which can happen if I'm planning things and wake up in the middle of the night, I become very irritable.\n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD about a year and a half ago. I've often thought about past situations and blamed them for my future, especially when I see certain types of individuals or am in certain settings that remind me of when I was younger and things happened that changed my future plans.

Often, by speaking about issues, I can come up with better alternative plans just by hearing myself talk.\n\nWhen I'm alone, I can be very 'inter-minded,' having a lot of thoughts that I keep to myself, and in that mode, I don't really interact with people. However, I can also change modes and interact. To relax, I've recently started doing yoga. When I'm annoyed, I usually try to remain quiet, listen, and think of alternate ways or plans to make the situation better. Being around positive people, listening to music, watching comedy shows, and good food also put me in a good mood.

Oh, I know After the semester ended when I noted that I did well in school Because it had been a long time since I went to school So when I received my grades, A and a B, I was like, wow, okay I can do this And it made me happy And that was about a few weeks ago, I guess That's great Thank you There's some of it that's been impossible to do There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life My mom, I know, it's good and bad I mean, for the most part, my mom's been a positive influence You know, it's just sometimes, you know, she gets a little Like she wants to re-raise me or something Like she doesn't understand that I'm an adult I'm going to make my own decisions now Pretty much have to let me do what I need to do A lot of heavy breathing I mean, I walk sometimes when I get a little frustrated Whatever, I'll just go take a walk You know, or just try not to think about it Thank you Yes Yes, the Navy I was 19 Yeah, yes I didn't have any other options I am, I probably should have stayed in a little longer I was only in for four years, but You know, I wanted to experience life outside the military So I did my enlistment and then I got out It made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that You know, did not join the military I could notice a big difference as far as, you know, how I lived my life and how they lived theirs Just made me a little bit more responsible Thank you I worked in the medical field for about five years And, oh, thank you But it wasn't for me, I wanted to do something a little bit different I didn't want to do patient care I wanted to work with people, but not necessarily as a patient care provider So I started going to school and then I met my husband I stopped going to school Got married and I started working in the telecommunications field And then we, you know, conceived our child and after that You know That's it I know I am, I'm very caring You know, I'm very honest to a fault sometimes You know, I try to be as honest as possible with people Sometimes it can hurt their feelings, but You know, you gotta be honest You can't let people think that, you know, you're not trusting And if Yeah, probably, I never really thought about it I don't know Maybe, I don't really think about it I just try to be the best person that I can be You know, so That's all I can do, I can't live for what other people think I can only do what I need to do I don't know I never really thought about it I guess it's just, you know, being around my kids You know, I just love being around my children That always puts me in a good mood Thank you Okay, like I said, a little tired, you know, but You know, for the most part, okay You know, dealing with situations different Well, I go to bed really early, so As long as I go to bed early, I get a good night's sleep But I wake up early as well, so It's kind of like Get in bed a little bit, I go to bed at like 8, 8.30 And then I wake up at like 1, 1.30 So Very moody Very irritable, short tempered, I guess If you're a little bit more sensitive If anything, I think I'm thinking more positively You know, like I said, especially with my son having a disability You know, I look at it as if You know, it's not all bad I mean, he has challenges But I'm dealing with them a lot better You know, as opposed to feeling sorry for him Or feeling sorry for myself You know, I'm just finding more avenues to work with him You know, different resources to help him As opposed to just feeling guilty or sad or depressed about it Thank you No Occasionally What color is your best friend? I don't know, can we skip that question? What color is your best friend? Green Seems to be the word, kind of like Yeah, probably green, like Naive a little But at the same time, smart I think she'll describe me as smart Thank you Okay No problem Bye Oh, I'm sorry, I gotta push the button It was fine, I kind of skipped one question though",
         "I'm feeling a bit tired today. A major challenge for me is raising my son with a disability; it's very hard not knowing how to help him. I've also dealt with a lot of frustration, particularly with my mom, who I feel gets too involved and put me down for wanting to socialize. I love her, but it makes me frustrated, and I hate even having those thoughts.\n\nMy sleep schedule is quite early; I go to bed around 8 or 8:30 PM, but then I wake up very early, like 1 or 1:30 AM. I've noticed I can be very moody, irritable, and short-tempered, and a bit more sensitive. I've definitely experienced feelings of guilt, sadness, or depression, especially concerning my son's disability. However, I'm now actively working to deal with these challenges better. I'm finding more avenues and resources to help him, and I'm trying to think more positively, rather than feeling sorry for him or myself, or getting stuck in those guilty, sad, or depressed feelings. When I get frustrated, I sometimes go for a walk or try not to think about it. The last time I felt truly happy was a few weeks ago after I did well in school, which was a big achievement for me after a long time.",

She's going to chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll say goodbye, and I will put the doorbell over here so you can let me know when you're done, okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions from the start. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Born downtown Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I love LA. I love the traffic on the 405. I love the beach. I live near the beach. I love...there's so much to do here. I just love...and I love the weather. I love it here. That's great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Nothing. Okay. Do you travel a lot? A little bit. What do you enjoy about traveling? I guess visiting family and destinations. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I last flew to Cedar Rapids to visit a friend, and was there for a couple weeks, and I'm flying back February 11th to see him again. He's an old friend. Thanks. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No. Why? I'm pretty outgoing. I talk to people. I enjoy talking to people. I talk to people at the airport. What do you do to relax? I garden a little bit. I read a little bit. I watch TV. I'm a basketball fan. I go to the beach when the weather is nice. I go to the pool. Okay. What are some things that make you a little mad? Annoying people, rude people, people that drive. They just have no consideration for others. What do you do when you're annoyed? I swear a lot. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, I'm all right. I get mad once in a while. When was the last time you argued with someone? It was probably my daughter. She's 21, almost 22. She lives at college, but comes home on the weekends, and her room was probably a mess. It's the same fight we've been having for years. Uh-oh. That's not good. Yeah, it does. It's better now that we don't live together all the time, though. That's good. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? I guess making the right decisions. It started out when she was little about education, the right school to go to, the right activities to do, setting a good example, being a good role model. What's the best thing about being a parent? Oh, everything. My kids are the greatest joy of my life. I love them so much. And you just get so enriched and fulfilled by them. And when the kids are little, you see things through their eyes, which is exciting. You want to share everything with them. That's so good to hear. Tell me about your kids. I have an older son who's a financial analyst, and then I have a daughter in college. She's a liberal studies major. She's going to be a teacher. Cool. What did you study at school? A business. Are you still working at that? Yes. What do you do now? I'm an office manager. What's your dream job? My dream job? Wow, that's hard. I don't know. I like my job. It's good. I like the people. I enjoy it. It's fun. Good. What do you think of the names of the kids? My son told me they're called the teacup generation because they're fragile. And I think their pain's in the ass, as most of them. Yeah. I see what you mean. Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Not for a while. Maybe a month ago. Can you tell me about that? I have a new boyfriend, and things were going really great, and now they're just going. It was great, and now it's just okay. I guess the newness wore off. How hard is that? It's hard. It's hard. How do you know them? I'm sorry? How do you know them? How do I know them? I don't know what you mean by them. Let's come back to that later. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I don't know. A year or so. What got you to this point? I just didn't feel well. I just couldn't. I just didn't feel right. I couldn't pull myself out of it. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? Oh, just sad and just lack of energy and didn't really, wasn't really motivated, didn't really, wasn't really my happy self. Do you feel like there's a useful? Therapy? Yes. Do you still get a therapy now? I do. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? Well, not that many changes. I still don't feel that great, but I just, it's good to talk to someone and tell them how you feel. Yeah. Even if it's just to get something off your chest. How have you been feeling lately? Tired, sad, depressed, blue. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I'm just not happy. I don't feel good and I'm not happy. How do you cope with that? I don't just stay to myself, don't go out with friends as much as I used to. That sounds really hard. It's very hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Terrible. I don't sleep. I'm sorry. Thank you. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Crazy, distracted. It's hard for me to cope with things. Easy, mundane things are just difficult. I see what you mean. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Well, being around my kids is fun. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? My son and daughter-in-law and my daughter and I went out to have Hawaiian food. We got together. It's always fun to get together. We got together at my house on Christmas. I enjoyed just getting together with them. Awesome. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'll take better care of my health, I guess. Have you done anything to avoid it? I don't know. I don't know. Okay. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my daughter's pretty positive and upbeat. My parents, they're both gone, but they were pretty positive. What's on your mind when you're most memorable experience? I suppose going on a trip to Canada with my daughter was very memorable. Can you tell me about that? We flew to Detroit, where I have my best friend lives there. We stayed with her. We drove from Detroit through Canada, Niagara Falls. We went to Buffalo, where she's from. She has three girls. My daughter was, I think, third or fourth grade, something like that. It was just fun for all of us to get together and do things. That sounds like a great situation. What would your best friend describe you? Exactly like her. We're outgoing. We're outspoken. We tell it like it is. We're high-energy people. We have a lot of anxiety. We like to do a lot of the same things. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. About three or four weeks ago. Tell me more about that. Well, I say that my feeling is attributed to weather. I don't like cold weather, and I'm not comfortable at all in it. Whenever the weather changes, I sort of get down. What would you say if somebody asked about you? Well, I'm funny. I'm hardworking. I care about everyone. I'm a very kind, compassionate person. I have sympathy for everyone. I'll reach out to someone that I see in a store or anywhere that needs my help. That's good. What are you most proud of in your life? I suppose raising my kids and the good people they've turned out to be. That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye.",

I've been coming here off and on for years, but officially moved here a couple years ago. I guess I've gotten as used to as I'm going to be. I don't know if that makes sense, but. Accessibility to different things as compared to Nebraska. You know, more opportunities to do different things and explore different things. Areas of interest. What are some things you don't really like about the lake? Crime. Attitude. Lack of work ethic. Lack of kindness and people. Cutthroat. Do you travel a lot? I used to. Quite a bit. What do you enjoy about traveling? A sense of freedom. The adventure. I'd love to hear about all your trips. Okay. You want me to tell you about a trip? Egypt. That's awesome. Tell me more about that. I went with my mother and some family friends. We went on an eight day cruise down the Nile. Saw all the pyramids in Giza. It was just an incredible adventure. Just to get away from everything and everybody. And close friends and just have a great time. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. How close are you to your family? Not really at all. Why? Just a history of abuse and neglect. Just not a real functional family. Dysfunctional is definitely a key word in our family. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? No, not really. I've talked about it a lot before. I'm okay with it. Okay. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. It's really hard to say. I haven't had very good, very positive role models. Ask me the question again. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. Maybe it bests my mother. She's also been a negative aspect of my life. I guess I can't really identify anybody who's been a real, real positive influence in my life. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? The trips that I've been on. What do you do to relax? I used to work out. I used to do yoga. I used to meditate. I used to exercise. I used to do a lot of things. Lately, I find it hard to relax. I don't have the same outlets that I did before. I don't pursue them as much anymore. I guess I lost my motivation or something. I'm depressed about it. I guess there it is right there. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. I'm not a temper as far as getting to the point of physicality. I don't ever that. But I stand my ground. But I can control my temper. I never lose control really. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time? Probably as recently as in the last month or so. I maybe argued with an acquaintance over... I don't know. I have to come back to that question. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Officially October of last year. I think I've been depressed longer than that. Officially October of last year. What got you to see the doctor? Actually I was being treated for other medical issues. My depression was notable to the doctors. Really? Yeah. Did you have a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? I've never been suicidal. I just often have thought that I don't have much reason to live. I used to think I had a purpose and such. I don't really have anybody in my life who I think cares enough about me. If I was even dead. I've kind of lost myself. I used to think I had enough. I used to be enough. That I was enough to have purpose in my life. I've lost quite a bit of that. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Well I'm trying to pull it together. I'm trying to get back a sense of me. I get inspired every once in a while. But overall I just don't seem to be making much progress. Do you still get up there every now and then? Yeah. Do you feel like there's a system? I wouldn't really call it therapy. I don't have a therapist per se. I have a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me. And nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues. It sucks. Uh huh. Did you say that sucks? Okay. Yeah. How have you been feeling lately? Um, overwhelmed, preoccupied. Just trying to stay alive. Stay on top of things. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or your conversation? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh, easy when I can. I don't, um, yeah, if I get a chance to fall asleep I don't have any problem with it. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm even more distracted and, um, even more lackluster I guess is the word. Sounds really hard. Whatever. How would your best friend describe you? If I had a best friend, um, I don't know. Maybe a lot of positive edges before but now just, you know, just, uh, some people say I should be proud because I'm surviving a hard time. Or some people think that I'm a loser. So, um, I don't know. Maybe a survivor. Persistent. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? Well, I used to be proud of my career and, um, kind of giving back to people. Giving back to society because I was given a lot it felt like. So I'm just proud to, uh, I don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest. I've, um, I don't know. Okay. What did you study at school? Psychology. And, um, well initially, yeah. Are you still working in that? Um, no. Not really per se although my current career involves a lot of, uh, psychology. A lot of, um, the aspects. I don't know what I'm trying to say. Um, it's a part of it but it's not the center of it. Hi, Mr. Man. What do you do now? Um, well, I guess if my career is still going I'm in nursing but, um, I've been sick lately and with depression and other health care problems I have found it necessary to apply for disability. Social Security income. And I'm starting the process of that because I'm not working. How hard is that? Mary. What's your dream job? Educating people. Um, making a difference. I mean I used to, I had my, I've had my dream jobs. I've had my dream jobs. I don't, uh, I don't know if the future will hold for, for, uh, work but, um, something I suppose working with people again. Health, uh, helping in some way. Okay. You consider yourself an introvert? Um, no but lately with depression more so at times. Uh huh. Is there anything you regret? I used to say that I never regretted anything because I would make the best decision of all things in front of me but, um, I just wish there were times then that, um, the choices that I would have were, uh, were better because some choices that I seem to have made or were made for me have, um, made my world kind of shitty. For lack of a better word, shitty. Can you give me an example of that? What? I don't understand. Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be strong. To, um, believe in myself. To remember that I've survived a lot of things and I'll survive this too. To get up off my ass and move. To, um, to have confidence. Faith. Um, I just, Murphy's Law has kicked my ass so much, you know. I just, uh, it seems like when I've tried to make my world better I just keep getting knocked down. Um, so it's almost like I'm, I don't want to give up but, um, every time I try and move forward I get knocked back. And it gets, it's exhausting. And I don't have any support system really. Nobody. Not really. What would you say of somebody who has followed you? Um, loyal. Um, hardworking. Um, dependable. Um, capable. Um, well, that seems to me. Uh, uh, intelligent. Contemplative. Um, deep. Not a superficial person. Um, yeah, I guess those are some of the... When was the last time you felt really happy? Many years ago. Can you tell me about that? Um, I used to have a lot of confidence. I used to be a pretty dynamic person. I used to be, people used to say that I was the most centered person that they knew. And I used to help people and I'm now in their shoes and I don't seem to be able to help myself. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I can't think of anything right now. I can't think of really anything right now. What are some things you like to do for fun? I don't do much anything for fun anymore. I used to, however, go to movies and entertainment venues and travel. Go to dinner with friends, do things. But lately I don't really have any pursuits. A good day, a happy day, a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong, basically. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye. Bye.",
         "Okay. All right, so now we'll start with the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. Okay. Nebraska. Work. I've been coming here off and on for years, but officially moved here a couple years ago. I guess I've gotten as used to as I'm going to be. I don't know if that makes sense, but. Accessibility to different things as compared to Nebraska. You know, more opportunities to do different things and explore different things. What are some things you don't really like about the lake? Crime. Attitude. Lack of work ethic. Lack of kindness and people. Cutthroat. Do you travel a lot? I used to. Quite a bit. What do you enjoy about traveling? A sense of freedom. The adventure. I'd love to hear about all your trips. Okay. You want me to tell you about a trip? Egypt. That's awesome. Tell me more about that. I went with my mother and some family friends. We went on an eight day cruise down the Nile. Saw all the pyramids in Giza. It was just an incredible adventure. Just to get away from everything and everybody. And close friends and just have a great time. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah. How close are you to your family? Not really at all. Why? Just a history of abuse and neglect. Just not a real functional family. Dysfunctional is definitely a key word in our family. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? No, not really. I've talked about it a lot before. I'm okay with it. Okay. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. It's really hard to say. I haven't had very good, very positive role models. Ask me the question again. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. Maybe it bests my mother. She's also been a negative aspect of my life. I guess I can't really identify anybody who's been a real positive influence in my life. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? The trips that I've been on. What do you do to relax? I used to work out. I used to do yoga. I used to meditate. I used to exercise. I used to do a lot of things. Lately, I find it hard to relax. I don't have the same outlets that I did before. I don't pursue them as much anymore. I guess I lost my motivation or something. I'm depressed about it. I guess there it is right there. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. I'm not a temper as far as getting to the point of physicality. I don't ever that. But I stand my ground. I can control my temper. I never lose control really. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time? Probably as recently as in the last month or so. I maybe argued with an acquaintance over... I don't know. I have to come back to that question. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Officially October of last year. I think I've been depressed longer than that. What got you to see the doctor? Actually I was being treated for other medical issues. My depression was notable to the doctors. Really? Yeah. Did you have a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? I've never been suicidal. I just often have thought that I don't have much reason to live. I used to think I had a purpose and such. I don't really have anybody in my life who I think cares enough about me. If I was even dead. I've kind of lost myself. I used to think I had enough. I used to be enough. That I was enough to have purpose in my life. I've lost quite a bit of that. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Well I'm trying to pull it together. I'm trying to get back a sense of me. I get inspired every once in a while. But overall I just don't seem to be making much progress. Do you still get up there every now and then? Yeah. Do you feel like there's a system? I wouldn't really call it therapy. I don't have a therapist per se. I have a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication for me. And nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues. It sucks. Uh huh. Did you say that sucks? Okay. Yeah. How have you been feeling lately? Um, overwhelmed, preoccupied. Just trying to stay alive. Stay on top of things. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or your conversation? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Uh, easy when I can. I don't, um, yeah, if I get a chance to fall asleep I don't have any problem with it. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I'm even more distracted and, um, even more lackluster I guess is the word. Sounds really hard. Whatever. How would your best friend describe you? If I had a best friend, um, I don't know. Maybe a lot of positive edges before but now just, uh, some people say I should be proud because I'm surviving a hard time. Or some people think that I'm a loser. So, um, I don't know. Maybe a survivor. Persistent. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? Well, I used to be proud of my career and, um, kind of giving back to people. Giving back to society because I was given a lot it felt like. So I'm just proud to, uh, I don't have much of a sense of pride anymore to be quite honest. I've, um, I don't know. Okay. What did you study at school? Psychology. And, um, well initially, yeah. Are you still working in that? Um, no. Not really per se although my current career involves a lot of, uh, psychology. A lot of, um, the aspects. I don't know what I'm trying to say. Um, it's a part of it but it's not the center of it. What do you do now? Um, well, I guess if my career is still going I'm in nursing but, um, I've been sick lately and with depression and other health care problems I have found it necessary to apply for disability. Social Security income. And I'm starting the process of that because I'm not working. How hard is that? What's your dream job? Educating people. Um, making a difference. I mean I used to, I've had my dream jobs. I don't, uh, I don't know if the future will hold for, uh, work but, um, something I suppose working with people again. Health, uh, helping in some way. Okay. You consider yourself an introvert? Um, no but lately with depression more so at times. Uh huh. Is there anything you regret? I used to say that I never regretted anything because I would make the best decision of all things in front of me but, um, I just wish there were times then that, um, the choices that I would have were, uh, better because some choices that I seem to have made or were made for me have, um, made my world kind of shitty. For lack of a better word. Can you give me an example of that? What? I don't understand. Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be strong. To, um, believe in myself. To remember that I've survived a lot of things and I'll survive this too. To get up off my ass and move. To, um, to have confidence. Faith. Um, I just, Murphy's Law has kicked my ass so much, you know. Uh, it seems like when I've tried to make my world better I just keep getting knocked down. Um, so it's almost like I'm, I don't want to give up but, um, every time I try and move forward I get knocked back. And it gets, it's exhausting. And I don't have any support system really. Nobody. Not really. What would you say of somebody who has followed you? Um, loyal. Um, hardworking. Um, dependable. Um, capable. Um, well, that seems to me. Uh, intelligent. Contemplative. Um, deep.

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to ask me questions that you find helpful. Okay, thank you. Okay, I have a question for Ellie. Who is the best girlfriend? I'm not sure how I got this question. I'm not sure how I got this question. I'm just not sure how you got this question. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in safe and secure environments. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York. Really? Why do you live in LA? To pursue a music industry, a job in the music industry. Are you still working on that? Yes. What do you do now? Self-employed. What's your dream job? To become a music producer. Awesome. How hard is that? It's pretty hard. There's a lot of competition. I see what you mean. When did you move to LA? To pursue a job. When did you move to LA? When? About a year ago, last February. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It was pretty difficult. East Coast is a lot different than the West Coast. Yeah. How often do you go back to your hometown? I think I've been there twice in the past year. That's good. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm more of a creature of habit. Okay. You consider yourself a creature of habit? Yes. Why? Sometimes I feel like I don't fit into the crowd. It's better sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of going in and actively pursue things. What do you do to relax? Probably listen to music and spend time with my dogs. What are some things that you do to relax? Probably people being not very nice to me or seeing injustices. I think that's about it. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone? Probably a couple of days ago. One of my friends was saying that they were making a comment about how I am and I got kind of upset about that. Does that happen now? Yeah, it does. How close are you to them? Pretty close. How do you know them? They're my best friend. I'm just one of my friends. What do you do when you're annoyed? I kind of am quiet about it. When a person pushes me to a certain point, that's when I overreact usually. How hard is that? It's pretty hard. I'd rather the person notice that I'm getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting to the point where it blows out of proportion. What's one thing that's memorable for you? Probably spending time with my family in New York. How close are you to your family? That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Tell me more about that. I don't know, they're just great people. I love them a lot. They're a lot like me, so I feel like I have people that understand me. That's good. Tell me your best time describing them. Probably loyal, sensitive. I don't know, it's kind of hard. It's a hard question. Have you ever sort of been military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Gosh, I think probably 1997, so a long time ago. What got you to see the health? During that time I was just going through a lot of issues and I was feeling unsafe to myself, so I ended up going to the doctor to kind of get meds and have therapy and stuff. Do you still go to therapy now? Not currently. I ended about like six months ago. Why did you stop? I just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me. I felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over, and she wasn't really challenging me. I've been in therapy for a really long time, so I just knew it was a change. Sorry to hear that. It's okay. Do you feel like there's a usefulness? Yes, I do actually. When I feel connected to a therapist, I feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what I'm going through. What sort of changes have been made since you've been in therapy? I'm better at describing my emotions and feelings. I think the biggest thing is when I'm in situations, I can see myself reacting one way, and I take a step back and see how I can react normally almost in a way. Also, I tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel really bad about myself. It's nice to talk to someone that's not judging, that doesn't really tell me it's okay basically. What were your symptoms? Feeling hopeless all the time, not having enough energy to do things I used to like, I had a little bit of concentration issues, having weird, disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind, and overall just feeling kind of crummy about life. Are they triggered by something? Sometimes they are, like random moments, if there's a problem with my interpersonal life or something like that, or if I sometimes even seeing something on television, sometimes that affects me. How do you tell people? Listening to music or trying to distract myself, trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things. How can you tell people you're related? It's been a tough transition to come here, well, being here, so kind of half and half okay and not okay. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? I feel like I've been a little bit more withdrawn lately, but that's about it. Okay, how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Some days it's great, some days it's not. More recently it's been a little bit more difficult. Why? I don't know why, I have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night, so I tend not to sleep very well, and I wake up quite frequently during the night. Why do you like to be down sleep well? I'm very groggy in the morning and that's about it. Like during the day I tend to yawn a lot, and my friends always are like, why are you yawning so much, are you just as interested in what we're doing? And I'm trying to tell them it's not that at all. Okay, when was the last time you had a good night's sleep? Probably Christmas time when I was with my family. How did you feel about your family? Just really happy and feeling like everything was alright in my life. Having a good sense of where I was at that moment, being present with myself. That's good. What would you say are some of the best qualities? Probably, you know, let's see, that's a hard question. I think probably I can tend to read people kind of well sometimes, and I like to say that I'm good at being a good friend to people, being a good family member. I'm a hard worker when I do have a job. Do you have any regrets? Sure, I mean it's life so of course there's regrets. One that comes to mind is I wish that I don't eat as much so I can be a lot more healthy. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't take things so seriously. Enjoy being youthful and I think that's it. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a good question. Probably my previous job and my employment I worked really well with kids. So I did a great job at that. I was a researcher at a hospital and I helped a lot of kids out for about six years, so seven years. Wow, that's interesting. Yeah, it was awesome. How did you decide to do that? I was really inclined to like reading people and so I decided to major in psychology. Then I went and worked in a mental health facility and did research with them with drugs and depression and things like that. It found a good niche for me. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. No problem. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hi. Take a moment to announce that I have stopped recording. Okay. Okay.",

         "I was diagnosed with depression a long time ago, back in 1997. I sought help because I was going through a lot of issues and felt unsafe to myself, which led me to get medication and therapy. I'm not currently in therapy; I stopped about six months ago because I felt my therapist wasn't really challenging me and we kept discussing the same things. However, I do find therapy useful when I connect with a therapist, as it helps me talk about what I'm going through. Through therapy, I've become better at describing my emotions and feelings, and I can now take a step back in situations to react more normally. I also used to bury my emotions and feel bad about myself, so it was helpful to talk to someone non-judgmental.\n\nMy symptoms have included feeling hopeless all the time, not having enough energy for things I used to enjoy, and having some concentration issues. I also experience weird, disturbing thoughts that sometimes pop into my mind, and an overall crummy feeling about life. These feelings can be triggered by random moments, problems in my interpersonal life, or even by seeing something on television.\n\nTo cope, I listen to music, try to distract myself, and my therapist encouraged me to journal. Lately, I've noticed I've been a bit more withdrawn. My sleep has also been more difficult recently; I have a lot of thoughts at night, so I don't sleep well and wake up frequently. This leaves me groggy and yawning a lot during the day, which my friends sometimes mistake for disinterest. The last time I had a truly good night's sleep was around Christmas when I was with my family in New York, which made me feel really happy and present. Moving to LA a year ago was also pretty difficult, and the transition has left me feeling \"half and half okay and not okay.\"",

         " Yes. I'm doing pretty good. I'm from Oklahoma. Yes. Yep. Oklahoma City. I'm from Oklahoma. Yep. Oklahoma City. Ah, the weather is great. I love being near the ocean and the palm trees and mountains. I just love it here. It's pretty easy. There's a few differences. It's a huge city compared to where I'm from, so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me. I just always wanted to live in California. I hated being landlocked in Oklahoma and just wanted to get out to the west coast, be near the ocean. I studied psychology and minored in art. No, not at the moment. Well, actually, I think I misunderstood your question. I'm not still working on my degree, but I am working in the field of psychology. I just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law. My dream job? Oh, I don't really know. I just want to help people however I can. I just like working with people in the realm of psychology, so I think I may already have my dream job. What do you do for a living? To relax. I like to read or watch movies. I like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends. What are the things that make you really mad? The things that make me really mad? Probably injustice towards other people, people being mistreated or abused, and people being lied to and deceived. Including myself, I hate being lied to. What do you do when you're mad? When I'm annoyed, it depends on the situation, but I try to just count to ten and take a deep breath and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way, so I just try and calm down before I say anything. How do you deal with anger? It depends again on the situation and who I'm angry with. Most of the time I'm pretty good at controlling it, but sometimes I think like most people I'll lash out at the people that I'm closest to at times, and those moments I'm not that good at controlling it. When was the last time you argued with someone? When was the last time I argued with someone? It was probably with my parents. I've been having some car trouble lately, and I'm also running low on money, so I don't even remember exactly, but I'm sure we probably thought about the fact that I need to be more self-sufficient and independent and take care of my own things like car issues. How close are you with your family? I'm very close with my family. They're still in Oklahoma, but I talk to them on phone all the time. What's happening with your mom? What kind of role model do you think she is? What kind of role model do you think she is? What kind of role model do you think she is? What is your favorite part of your life?

         " Let me see. I think from this distance I think I better. Yes. Okay. From here from Alhambra. The weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. What are some things you don't really like about the weather? Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Is that amazing? How did you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? Yes. What are you doing now? I'm a photographer. Nice. What's your dream job? Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. Okay. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. I see. How do you like your living situation? It's fair. It's not the greatest. Because of being an apartment manager, I do have free rent, but I have to stay there a lot. That's tough. That part does. The free rent part is very good. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Oh gosh. My most memorable experience. That's hard to say. Well, I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. What else do you like? Oh, well I guess some sports success when I was in high school. There were a few things that I was happy about. And some art pieces I've made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death. Those are very memorable and not good though. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters. So my family. How close are you to your family? We're fairly close. Most of them live around in LA. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. Wow. When do you think of the music? Mostly very talented. Just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. Seems like they were all hooked into social media. What do you do to relax? I go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. And I... Well, there's some kind of injustices that happen. Not big deals, but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend. And when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it. And we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set up time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up. When they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that part is upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up at the office. They just need to please the school to maintain the account. So often when that something like that happens, it means they will not send you out to work at that school again, which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. That's how they do things. So that is upsetting. How do you cope with that? Most of the time I dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that might be better. That's good. Yeah. How are you at controlling your company? Pretty good. I usually might, in the moment I don't really lose it, but later I might vent or something like that. But on the location I wouldn't do that. When was the last time you argued with someone? Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. I have a friend that I'm sharing the car with today. We were arguing on where to go first. So we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And then after this was one of the things is over, then we're going to do some more of her things. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Is that what that is? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I'd say 1980. Yeah, I believe it was 1980. What got you to see the doctor? My father noticed some symptoms. My father passed away, but he was a psychiatrist. What were your symptoms? Well, I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon. And I didn't have a focus like for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all part of depression. Yeah. Isn't it that you had a problem before you found out? Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? Well, I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done. But I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. What sort of changes have you noticed since you came on the field? I think therapy makes you see what the... I thought of it as a filter or wearing a... As if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really... You see everything through that. So you have to... I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately? Or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. How have you been doing lately? I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I've noticed in my past. Right now we have a work slowdown. So it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule is too wide open. For me personally as a depressed person, I think that structure is really important. It gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere on time and interact with people. Those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed. I think I've noticed any changes in your behavior. Well, I don't know if it changes a little bit. I tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting let's say. But it's more negative. I have been thinking about how soldiers in the past, I don't know why, but during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been like to be in a front line battle with crude weapons and no medical help. I don't know. My mind seems to go there a lot where I'm just thinking about that. I've been looking at and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube and things like that. Or some other kind of like terrible doom type things like I was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that. Where I probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. Oh, you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not finishing college. I think I was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well. I didn't get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years. So that's a big regret that I have. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I think it would have been to, at certain points, I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals, just the logistics. I was an art major and I had no car. So a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and also to meet at away locations. I think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time. What would you say as somebody who has holidays? Well, I've been told I'm very patient and also I have some original artistic ideas. So those are good qualities. I'm very loyal and also I support my friends. I'm fairly generous with them. Tell me about something you really enjoyed. Let's see. Let's see, I really enjoyed it. I had a nice experience just photographing a soccer game recently. I really enjoyed that. I love listening to you talk. Okay, I think I've answered everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. It's my pleasure. Thank you, goodbye. Yeah, that was very interesting.

There's been 58. Oh, okay. Each study search has like a different number, like 200 and like 200. Oh, okay. All right, well there she is. And I will put the word on that for you. Okay, cool. Thanks. She'll get started? Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people and saved them to feel in my life. I'm not aware of us, but I'm here to learn about people and without knowing about you, I'll ask you a few questions about stuff. And please feel free to send me anything. Your answers are free and convenient. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? Fine. Where are you from in the city? Tampa, Florida. Why did you move to LA? That's a point I wanted to get into the entertainment industry. When did you move to LA? 1990. How easy was it for you to get used to it in the morning? It took a long time to get used to it. It wasn't easy. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather and if you have a hobby, you could always find a large group of people that are interested in the same hobbies you have. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, some of the people in the business world, it's pretty transient. They come and go and it's kind of difficult as far as if you, trusting people in the business world has been difficult. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not much at all. How does it compare to LA? It's quite different. The weather's different, the people are different. It's very different. Are you traveling a lot? No. What did you study at school? God, it was so long ago. School, just general stuff, business, acting, that kind of thing. What are you doing now? Well, I'm working on becoming a professional poker player and I left the stock brokerage industry successfully to do financial trading, stock options, futures, that kind of stuff. Do you consider yourself a member? Sometimes, yes. What are some things that you're doing? People, my family, just people making fun of me or just instigators, just being around negative, hostile people. What do you do when you're in orbit? I vent, ruminate over the same situation over and over again. How are you at confirming your own opinion? Pretty darn good. When was the last time you argued with someone and not with your own? Can't remember. Argued with someone. I can't really remember. That's a good sign. I don't argue much these days. Maybe online? Not really, I don't know. What's a good change? I don't know. What did I argue with somebody about? Maybe, it's been a long time. I can't really remember. Oh, I'd say Tony Robbins. Anthony Robbins. Listen to music, surf the internet, study poker, research on stocks. Watch YouTube clips. More towards my sisters, not my parents. I'm not close at all with my parents. Been estranged. No. Not officially, but some people, say I do have the symptoms of it when I've been talking about depression. Yes. I was diagnosed in the early 1990s with dysthymia, which is a mild form of depression, I think, or a long-term lasting mild depression. What thought you as being healthy? A friend had thought he had a learning disability called attention deficit disorder. At that time it was ADHD, so when I looked at the literature, it seemed similar to the symptoms that I had, so then I went to go through the same battery of tests that he did at UCLA. He still doesn't care for you now? No. Why did he stop? It's more of a financial thing. Do you feel like there's a difference? Yes. How do you feel about it? Irritable, moody, tired. Have you ever studied to use another way to get rid of the symptoms? Yes. How easy is it for you to get rid of them? Not easy. What are you like when you're not feeling well? Airheaded, spacey, slow. How do you cope with that? How do I do what? How do you cope with that? Cope with what? How do I? Just come back to that later. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I can't remember. Tell me about something you would never do to me that you really wouldn't do. Play poker online. When was the last time you where that for? In Teacher's Birthday. Yes. Yes? Wow, that's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago, it would have said to stay away from losers, avoid negative people. Don't try to change them, don't try to give them advice, don't try to help them out, don't try to show them the right way. It's just a waste of your energy, my energy. Don't do business with unethical people. New York City wise guys, New York City type wise guys, chronic liars, BSers, and uh... what does it say? Kept my room in better order, dated more women, dated more women, cleaned my room, do a better job of you know, enjoying my nice apartment and my single bachelorhood. Probably surviving my difficult childhood, my dysfunctional family, staying out of trouble, staying away from drugs, illegal drugs, making a name for myself as a good stock trader, good stock picker, and sort of my wisdom I've been able to pass on about eastern philosophy.

Thank you.",
         "That's the other question I had. My number 358, that doesn't mean there was, does that mean there was like 357 other people before me? Okay, that's what I was thinking, yeah. Yeah. There's been 58. Oh, okay. Each study search has like a different number, like 200. Oh, okay. All right, well there she is. And I will put the word on that for you. Okay, cool. Thanks. She'll get started? Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people and saved them to feel in my life. I'm not aware of us, but I'm here to learn about people and without knowing about you, I'll ask you a few questions about stuff. And please feel free to send me anything. Your answers are free and convenient. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? Fine. Where are you from in the city? Tampa, Florida. Why did you move to LA? That's a point I wanted to get into the entertainment industry. When did you move to LA? 1990. How easy was it for you to get used to it in the morning? It took a long time to get used to it. It wasn't easy. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather and if you have a hobby, you could always find a large group of people that are interested in the same hobbies you have. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, some of the people in the business world, it's pretty transient. They come and go and it's kind of difficult as far as trusting people in the business world has been difficult. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not much at all. How does it compare to LA? It's quite different. The weather's different, the people are different. It's very different. Are you traveling a lot? No. What did you study at school? God, it was so long ago. School, just general stuff, business, acting, that kind of thing. What are you doing now? Well, I'm working on becoming a professional poker player and I left the stock brokerage industry successfully to do financial trading, stock options, futures, that kind of stuff. Do you consider yourself a member? Sometimes, yes. What are some things that you're doing? People, my family, just people making fun of me or just instigators, just being around negative, hostile people. What do you do when you're in orbit? I vent, ruminate over the same situation over and over again. How are you at confirming your own opinion? Pretty darn good. When was the last time you argued with someone and not with your own? Can't remember. Argued with someone. I can't really remember. That's a good sign. I don't argue much these days. Maybe online? Not really, I don't know. What's a good change? I don't know. What did I argue with somebody about? Maybe, it's been a long time. I can't really remember. Oh, I'd say Tony Robbins. Anthony Robbins. Listen to music, surf the internet, study poker, research on stocks. Watch YouTube clips. More towards my sisters, not my parents. I'm not close at all with my parents. Been estranged. No. Not officially, but some people say I do have the symptoms of it when I've been talking about depression. Yes. I was diagnosed in the early 1990s with dysthymia, which is a mild form of depression, I think, or a long-term lasting mild depression. What thought you as being healthy? A friend had thought he had a learning disability called attention deficit disorder. At that time it was ADHD, so when I looked at the literature, it seemed similar to the symptoms that I had, so then I went to go through the same battery of tests that he did at UCLA. He still doesn't care for you now? No. Why did he stop? It's more of a financial thing. Do you feel like there's a difference? Yes. How do you feel about it? Irritable, moody, tired. Have you ever studied to use another way to get rid of the symptoms? Yes. How easy is it for you to get rid of them? Not easy. What are you like when you're not feeling well? Airheaded, spacey, slow.

I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I am from Los Angeles. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? It's the center of everything. You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, being in LA also, you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But you know, you live with that. I see. What did you study at school? I was a business administration major, so I studied business. And after I finished college, I pursued a career in retail operations. Are you still doing that? No. As a matter of fact, I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years. So I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. What made you decide to do that? A couple of factors. After working numerous years in the retail business, I switched over and worked in a creative business, which was a graphic design firm. And I captured a lot of knowledge in the human resources side because I was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a small company. Are you happy you did that? Yes, I'm very happy I did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it's very helpful. That's great. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? Well, my dream job is I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am an independent contractor. I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs. And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle. But I also enjoy what I do. I'm not under as much stress as I used to be. That sounds like a great decision. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not totally outgoing, but I'm not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle, maybe more towards outgoing, but I'm not totally outgoing. When I'm around other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself. Can you tell me about that? Oh, sure. A couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had bypass operation. It had to do with stress and things like that. I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If I meet someone new, I don't just openly say, well, I've experienced this, this, and this. If it comes up, I won't deny it. If it comes up and I feel like it's something to talk about, I will talk about it. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom, my mother. She's a senior citizen. She's alone. What I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that. That's actually very therapeutic. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm not a short-fused kind of person. It takes a lot to get me really angry. As far as my temper is concerned, there's not much to that. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? I'm trying to think here. I can't recall when the last time it was, but it was probably last year sometime when I had a creditor that I was dealing with being very difficult to work with. I owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago. They weren't very understanding of the situation. I really got a little upset about that because I felt like I was being honest with them and I was more than willing to take care of my issues, but they were playing hardball and I didn't care for that. That sucks. It does. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Probably the hardest decision I ever had to make was it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who was battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him, there was a slight chance it was going to help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point, or it would kill him. That was really tough. It was a really tough decision to make. I felt like if I didn't try and see if we could help save his life or if we didn't take a chance and take that extra step, that I would regret it in the long run. That's really hard. It is. It was. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Right now I'm separated from my wife. She has her issues, I have my issues, but we are not divorced. We are just separated. We still have a relationship where we still speak to each other. We just don't live together. The relationship with my mother is really great. She's very understanding. I'm an only child, so she likes having me around, which is good because she's in her later stage of her life. She's 82 years old. I guess it's good that in its own way, maybe fate has taken place because someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing, but with me there, I think there's a comfort level she feels with me there, especially being her only child. What's something you feel guilty about? Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things that I did to hurt my marriage. As far as the things that I did, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had, and we were growing apart. When she was away, my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. I spent a lot of time in the casinos, and what eventually happened was I spent a lot of money. Obviously, that was a major issue regarding our relationship. It had to do with trust because it was devastating to my wife. How did you feel at that moment? When it came to light, I felt very guilty, and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. I'm sorry. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not at all. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, not really. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping, so no. That's good. Do you feel down? No, not at all. Have you ever spent a change in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. The only thing I can say is that after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. I tend to be a little bit more easygoing, and my friends and family have noticed that. That's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy? Probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. He basically said to me that after many tests and many months of rehabilitation, that he was happy to explain to me that there was no major scar tissue that had occurred because of my heart attack, and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watched my diet and took my medications. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I guess the number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight, just in general be more healthier physically. As far as mentally, just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things, and not to be so selfish. How do you cope with that? Just one day at a time. I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch TV. I do things that I know that if I can help myself, I do things to help myself. Is there anything you regret? There's a lot that I regret, obviously. My marriage, my working career as far as I had a long career with this major's food chain. Basically because of my gambling issues, I ended up ruining a very good career. At this point right now, there's not much I can do. I can't change what's been done, so I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me every day. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself and make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent, but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things, but deep down I don't think as a person I'm a bad person. I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had an illness, a compulsive, obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill. I was a sick person just trying to become healthy. Every day that's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night, one day at a time. How hard is that? It's not as hard as you think, but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you. It could be okay for other people to do certain things, but I cannot do those things anymore. How are your best friends around you? Most of my best friends describe me as probably easygoing, generous, a nice person to be around. They were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage, which it's still not over yet. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning, like around six o'clock. I go to a local park and it's about, this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning. I get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. Then after that I go home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax, and then just kick back for the rest of the day. Then the next day I do the same thing again. In the morning I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch TV, whatever, just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. Nice. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Lock yourself out. Okay. It's kind of, I actually got comfortable talking to you. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, that's pretty cool.",

I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had, and we were growing apart. When she was away, my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. I spent a lot of time in the casinos, and what eventually happened was I spent a lot of money. Obviously, that was a major issue regarding our relationship. It had to do with trust because it was devastating to my wife. How did you feel at that moment? When it came to light, I felt very guilty, and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. I'm sorry. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not at all. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, not really. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping, so no. That's good. Do you feel down? No, not at all. Have you ever spent a change in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. The only thing I can say is that after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. I tend to be a little bit more easygoing, and my friends and family have noticed that. That's great. Tell me about the last time I felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy? Probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. He basically said to me that after many tests and many months of rehabilitation, that he was happy to explain to me that there was no major scar tissue that had occurred because of my heart attack, and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watched my diet and took my medications. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I guess the number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight, just in general be more healthier physically. As far as mentally, just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things, and not to be so selfish. How do you cope with that? Just one day at a time. I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch TV. I do things that I know that if I can help myself, I do things to help myself. Is there anything you regret? There's a lot that I regret, obviously. My marriage, my working career as far as I had a long career with this major's food chain. Basically because of my gambling issues, I ended up ruining a very good career. At this point right now, there's not much I can do. I can't change what's been done, so I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me every day. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself and make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent, but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things, but deep down I don't think as a person I'm a bad person. I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had an illness, an obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill. I was a sick person just trying to become healthy. Every day that's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night, one day at a time. How hard is that? It's not as hard as you think, but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you. It could be okay for other people to do certain things, but I cannot do those things anymore. How are your best friends around you? Most of my best friends describe me as probably easygoing, generous, a nice person to be around. They were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage, which it's still not over yet. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning, like around six o'clock. I go to a local park and it's about, this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning. I get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. Then after that I go home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax, and then just kick back for the rest of the day. Then the next day I do the same thing again. In the morning I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch TV, whatever, just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. Nice. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Lock yourself out. Okay. It's kind of, I actually got comfortable talking to you. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, that's pretty cool.",
         "I've been told I don't have depression, and I don't feel 'down,' nor do I have trouble sleeping. However, I've experienced deep guilt and felt 'less than a human being' because of past selfish actions, particularly those that hurt my marriage. I also carry regret about how my gambling issues ruined my career and affected my marriage. I recognize my past behaviors as 'wrong' and 'selfish,' but deep down, I don't think I'm a bad person; I see my compulsive gambling as an 'illness' or 'obsessive compulsive behavior' I was trying to become healthy from.\n\nMy compulsive gambling, which I used as a form of release from tremendous work stress, led to significant financial issues and was devastating to my wife, ultimately leading to our separation. It also ruined a good career. Despite these challenges, I maintain a structured daily life, including living with and helping my mother, which I find very therapeutic. Since my heart attack a few years ago, I've become more easygoing, not letting small things bother me as much.\n\nMy primary struggle was compulsive gambling, which I now understand was an 'illness' or 'obsessive compulsive behavior.' To cope, I live 'one day at a time,' focusing on being at peace with myself and having peace of mind daily. My strategies include meditation, reading, and watching TV. I'm diligent about my behavior and routines, knowing what's not right for me and avoiding those things. I try not to focus on the past, instead concentrating on the present and my ongoing recovery. My gambling issues emerged during a period of high work stress for both my wife and me, causing us to grow apart. My friends were shocked when they learned about my issues. I'm currently living with my 82-year-old mother, which provides comfort for her and is therapeutic for me. My recovery from compulsive behavior is an ongoing daily process.",

         " therapy like this instead of with a live human, it'll put all the MFTs out of business. I think it's good sometimes. I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to, if it's someone that might just go by their questions, might judge you or form opinions. If it's a virtual human being, it might be a little less biased also. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly. All right, so I'm going to start up all the recording and then I'm going to actually... I'm trying to slide on some pictures. Sorry, that's in there. Now she is... So now she's going to have a conversation with you. She's going to ask you some questions. When she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to leave you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're all finished. Thank you very much. How do I know... Is she going to say end of session or... Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. Not at all. Sorry about that. I am. I feel pretty good. I'm wide awake. I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee. And I have an easy day today. So I am just going to chat with you. Then I'm going to the gym and run some errands. So I plan on having a nice day today. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here. And I went to school away. But I'm one of the few natives that are actually in Los Angeles. Yes, I am. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. Having owned a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida. I love the weather here. I like the culture. I like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away, one can go to the desert, say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours away, you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's a great place to live. Thank you. Yeah. Well, maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also the regulations, I'm a small business owner. So all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera, some of the other Western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here in California. It really does. Most people don't understand it, but it's also, besides the high taxes, there's a big immigration problem, which being born and raised here, most people don't see that, but it's the big tax on the social service system. And that's what makes our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's, but people don't seem to want to really deal with that, but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries and I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit and I've learned a couple of languages and I surf. Like what? I'm sorry? Like what? I didn't really understand your question. When you said like what, I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa, and I enjoy that and I enjoy warm climates now, especially where you can go and relax, where there's warm water to surf. It's the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. And I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Oh, sure. One of my favorite trips of all time, whereas I used to when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span, but about 10 years ago, we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city, even though I've been there about 10 times, we got to know the city really well, which was great. Really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping, but really having been there so many times, it really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about almost a month and really get to learn the city and it was fun. Even though I grew up in LA, I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I was younger, so my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable, but I took French all through elementary, junior high and high school. So it was nice to practice my French, even though I don't remember a whole lot, and even though I started speaking French with the French, my accent is some of the greatest, so after a couple of sentences, they start talking English to me. So that was a... Did you study at school? I have a few different degrees. So I was in Naval Science major as an undergraduate, and that was fun. And I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a degree in crisis management. What made you decide to do that? I found them interesting, and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college, I went to the Naval Academy, and I went there to play sports, and I found it real interesting, being from Southern California, going to school in Maryland. And I originally wanted to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. Are you still working in that? I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products, and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather, recently father, passed away, so I sort of run a 80-year-old family business, and it's pretty interesting. I like it, having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. What's your dream job? Actually, probably my dream job? I think it's fun, because I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home, and I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. Because I do have one daughter, and didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked, but I think I would be better than, say, a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids, that I like doing it always on a part-time basis, but it seems like, boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that, having pretty much worked for most of my life. An apartment never happened, but it sounds something that, to me, would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or a villain? I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert, whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted. But I think when I feel comfortable with certain people, and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be totally confident, or people I might have known for years, either from a personal or business situation. And be more introverted. I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy generally, and I like to use the term reserved. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? What do you do to relax? Oh, wow, that's a great idea. I used to have that on one of my ... I have several computers at home, and that used to be one of my screensavers as well. I usually tend, when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, maybe going surfing or the weather is warm. I don't surf in cold weather anymore. This makes ... It gives me like a brain freeze, even though I've surfed for over 30 years. I usually find exercise helps me relax the best, or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver. I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. That's great. That was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master, though, was my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years, I think I've gotten better at them. I think that's a key thing, and I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more ... I hadn't had those skills earlier. How are you at controlling your temper? I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. I am more likely to think before I speak now, whereas, say, 20 years ago, I was more likely to act before I thought. So I might have said more things that I ... In whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation, but I've never had a violent temper, but I would have a temper where I would fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. I think a lot of that comes ... I think the key word there is maturity. When was the last time you argued with someone and had to get it out? Oh, wow. You know, I was in the 20s. Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Basically, one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different, and I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just ... I don't know if I call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married, does someone have children with them? That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep. I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I'm I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",

I like the culture. I like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away, one can go to the desert, say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours away, you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's a great place to live. Thank you. Yeah. Well, maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also the regulations, I'm a small business owner. So all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera, some of the other Western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here in California. It really does. Most people don't understand it, but it's also, besides the high taxes, there's a big immigration problem, which being born and raised here, most people don't see that, but it's the big tax on the social service system. And that's what makes our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's, but people don't seem to want to really deal with that, but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries and I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit and I've learned a couple of languages and I surf. Like what? I'm sorry? Like what? I didn't really understand your question. When you said like what, I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa, and I enjoy that and I enjoy warm climates now, especially where you can go and relax, where there's warm water to surf. It's the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. And I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Oh, sure. One of my favorite trips of all time, whereas I used to when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span, but about 10 years ago, we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city, even though I've been there about 10 times, we got to know the city really well, which was great. Really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping, but really having been there so many times, it really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about almost a month and really get to learn the city and it was fun. Even though I grew up in LA, I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I was younger, so my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable, but I took French all through elementary, junior high and high school. So it was nice to practice my French, even though I don't remember a whole lot, and even though I started speaking French with the French, my accent is some of the greatest, so after a couple of sentences, they start talking English to me. So that was a... Did you study at school? I have a few different degrees. So I was in Naval Science major as an undergraduate, and that was fun. And I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a degree in crisis management. What made you decide to do that? I found them interesting, and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college, I went to the Naval Academy, and I went there to play sports, and I found it real interesting, being from Southern California, going to school in Maryland. And I originally wanted to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. Are you still working in that? I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products, and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather, recently father, passed away, so I sort of run a 80-year-old family business, and it's pretty interesting. I like it, having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. What's your dream job? Actually, probably my dream job? I think it's fun, because I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home, and I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. Because I do have one daughter, and didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked, but I think I would be better than, say, a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids, that I like doing it always on a part-time basis, but it seems like, boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that, having pretty much worked for most of my life. An apartment never happened, but it sounds something that, to me, would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or a villain? I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert, whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted. But I think when I feel comfortable with certain people, and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be totally confident, or people I might have known for years, either from a personal or business situation. And be more introverted. I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy generally, and I like to use the term reserved. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Oh, wow, that's a great idea. I used to have that on one of my ... I have several computers at home, and that used to be one of my screensavers as well. I usually tend, when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, maybe going surfing or the weather is warm. I don't surf in cold weather anymore. This makes ... It gives me like a brain freeze, even though I've surfed for over 30 years. I usually find exercise helps me relax the best, or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver. I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. That's great. That was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master, though, was my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years, I think I've gotten better at them. I think that's a key thing, and I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more ... I hadn't had those skills earlier. How are you at controlling your temper? I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. I am more likely to think before I speak now, whereas, say, 20 years ago, I was more likely to act before I thought. So I might have said more things that I ... In whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation, but I've never had a violent temper, but I would have a temper where I would fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. I think a lot of that comes ... I think the key word there is maturity. When was the last time you argued with someone and had to get it out? Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Basically, one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different, and I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just ... I don't know if I call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married, does someone have children with them? That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",
         "I've experienced periods of feeling blue in the past, and I have a family history of it. While these times were concerning, they weren't debilitating, and I was generally able to function on my own. I sought counseling for these concerns, initially being against therapy, but now I find it very useful for gaining clarity and talking through my thoughts and feelings with an unbiased professional, especially an older woman. I also clearly experience seasonal affective disorder; I feel much happier when the weather is nice and sunny, but I tend to feel dark and blue when it's rainy and cold. To relax and manage stress, I rely on exercise like yoga, walking, going to the gym, or surfing, and sometimes just vegging out on the couch. I've worked on mastering these relaxation skills, especially as I've gotten older. I've also improved my emotional regulation; in my younger years, I was more impulsive and would fly off the handle, but now I think before I speak and reflect more. I do regret not spending more time with my parents before they passed and not spending as much time with my daughter when she was younger.",

         " Okay, sounds good. Yeah. I'm great. I'm great. Thank you. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity. I feel LA by itself is a country. There's so much to do, so much to explore. And there's nothing like it. I feel the same. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I like to travel more though. I've been to a few countries. Like what? I've been to, I won't say Europe, that's a continent. I've been to London. I was born here, but my family's from Nigeria, so I've been to Nigeria a few times. I've been to Denmark, Amsterdam. I've been to Germany. And I think that's it. Awesome. What are you enjoying about traveling? Just exploring new places, seeing new things, meeting new people, a different culture. It definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it. And also going to countries that may not be as developed as the US, it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of this country. I'd love to hear about London because... I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm in LA. But at the same time, you can go at a very, very slow pace. We didn't do any driving. We just went on the Tube, which is there, like the underground subway station, which I absolutely fell in love with. Just exploring different parts of the city. We went to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey. When I went there, they had the premiere of, what movie was this, Slumdog Millionaire. And also they had the premiere for Seven Pounds, it was a movie with Will Smith. They did, so Will Smith was over there. Me and my friends were kind of screaming like we were groupies. Just for antics. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. That sounds like a great situation. What did you study at school? Business management and option and human resources management. What that means, I have no idea. How did you decide to do that? Good question. I've always wanted to go into business. And I've always wanted to study finance, but I didn't think I would learn too much about finance from college per se. I think I learned more in the real world, whatnot. So the other option was human resource. And I'm always fascinated about relationships and people, always reading articles about that stuff. So I went for that. Are you still doing that? No. Well, I still kind of use what I've learned, but I work in property management. So it still has to do with people. Anything to do with people, I'm fascinated about. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for you. What's your dream job? That's a good one. My dream job. Wow. I would say being a life coach. Really? Yeah, I would say that was my dream job because I love helping people become successes. And I love being a part of someone else's success, regardless of how small it is. Whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation. You consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm quiet into myself. So, yeah. Right. To relax. I usually listen to music. I usually listen to music to relax me or I pray to relax myself or listen to some really calm music. So, yeah. Very good. Very, very good. I used to, I wouldn't say it was a bad temper, but I was known to go off, quote unquote. Not throwing chairs or anything like that. I'm a very, very patient person. Once that patient is gone and for you to do that, you have to really, really, really, really push my buttons for a long time. And once it's done, I just go off. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. No. What was the last time you argued with somebody? The last time I argued with somebody. Wow. I haven't argued with somebody in a long time. Boy. I argued with my, no. I would say my, I think my dad, I argued with him. About We were disagreeing on some things about when we were going to supposed to go back to Nigeria. And he wasn't listening to, it was kind of like a group discussion, myself and my, my siblings, and he was being very subjective. He wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns. So it started an argument. How did you feel about having to? Very I wouldn't say angry per se, but I felt very kind of like I was losing control. Like I'm the type where I like to be in control of my emotions and my thoughts and I feel once that patience is gone and I start going off, it's kind of like this. This, you know, I would call it a blur, but I'm very witty and quick with what I say. So I'll instantly say something that, you know, Not to say hurtful, but very direct and to the point. I make sure I get my point across. Yeah. I have three brothers, one, one younger, two older, and very close to my family and my mom was one of my best friends. My brothers are great. Love them to death. My father. He's more so out of the picture. Yeah. I don't I don't really I'm not the guilty type. I don't feel guilty. I'm not one to shy away from what I've done and I definitely own up to what I do. I'm not one to shy away from responsibility, but I don't think I ever feel guilty for anything I do. Yeah, I don't think I feel I usually don't feel guilty. Yeah. Pretty, pretty easy. Pretty easy at, you know, pretty good at falling asleep, except when I'm excited or I'm reading. I'm trying to when I'm when I'm focused on learning something like I'll read and read and read, even when it's past my bedtime. But now I'm trying to work on waking up much earlier than when I am now. And that's kind of a little bit of a struggle, but I'm getting to it. So. Good. I've been feeling I've been feeling fine. You know, I'm generally I have a very, very happy disposition. And so no, you know, deep, depressing moods, nothing like that. I will never if I feel do feel like I'm going I don't allow myself to go to that place. No. No. I would say it's I wouldn't say necessary changes, but I'd say more so behaviors, learning how to let go of past decisions, maybe. And kind of how they they played their course in my life. I just sometimes I kind of look back and say, what if I did this? What would have how would life be now? Yeah. So those are some games I play. But other than that, that's it. Is there anything regret? Hmm. Regrets. Uh, no, no, there's anything I regret. What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago, I would say, don't be afraid of who you are. Be authentic. More importantly, with yourself. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Hmm. Erase from my memory. Uh, that's a good one. Erase from my memory. Uh, I would say when I told my dad that he should act like a father. Maybe I should. Yeah, there was. That was actually one of the times I another time I went off, usually with him. Basically, I had decided not to go to a private, not to go away for college. I decided to stay local so I can look after my little brother. And my senior year, I was overloading with everything I had maybe like four AP classes. I was working. I was working three jobs at the time, and I was also on track and field. So, needless to say, I was kind of like burning myself out. And I wasn't doing one AP calculus because I decided to go to a JC first and transfer. Also to save money for college too. And when I told them, you know, the teacher called saying I was falling asleep in class. Just because, mind you, after school I'd work an eight hour shift because I was a retail manager at the time. So, and I'd come home after that shift to do homework, calculus let alone. So, he would get upset and I told him, I spoke to my counselor. I already told him that I don't need that class to go to the JC. Because that's something I'm going to continue with. So I'm just going to, I can't drop out at that point in time. So I'm just going to, you know, just take the D or fail or whatever. And he didn't like that because he is a teacher. I think maybe that's maybe where it came from. He's a teacher as well. And so he started blaming like my job, wanting to call my boss. And it was just too much. And I told him, you know, since you're my father you should act like it. But it was a more aggressive way I said it. So that was one thing. Well, I actually, I do remember, I do regret one thing. And that is I wish I continued with college throughout. Like I burnt myself out. I was spreading myself too thin. I was actually on track to graduate from college at, I want to say 19. Because I started taking college classes in high school, starting sophomore year in high school. But with that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working, I just kind of like stopped going to school for a while and just worked. But I went back to finish. So, but I wish I just would have continued. Maybe that's one small thing, but that's something small though. Yeah. What would you say as somebody who has qualities? I'm very, I'm a very compassionate and understanding person. I like learning new things. I'm a very, very happy person. People come to me for advice. I'm very objective. I'll tell you the good, the bad, the ugly. And yeah, those are some of my best qualities. I'm fun. I like to have fun. I have fun in any situation. I can make light of any situation. Like I'm the kind of type person I can break the tension in the room. That sort of, that sort of personality trait. Cool. Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Michelle's taller. Besides my height. Hmm. I wish maybe. I don't know if it's a be more. I want to say be more in touch with my emotions, but I think I would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes. I think that would be one thing because I'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me. And I'm like, okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate that. But I don't realize how much they do. I think that's realizing how much they care and love me. That's one thing I would like to get more of a grasp on. Yeah. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend. She describes me as someone who's funny, crazy, objective, loyal, ambitious, hardworking, mean. I always make jokes. She says, you're so mean. But. Why? I just like to joke around all the time. And so we were right now actually planning a friend of mine or friend of ours, a baby shower. I'm giving her some ideas. And there's another friend who was invited who we had some issues in the past and someone I don't talk to or hang out with. We used to be really close, but I don't really talk to a person, but I don't mind them being there. So she also talked about celebrating her birthday. Also, kind of like after the baby shower. And there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we didn't do anything for. And I'm like, well, we're celebrating this person's birthday. Might as well. We should definitely honor this person's birthday as well, since we're closer to the person whose birthday is past. And I said, you know what? Just when we celebrate everybody's birthday, forget the baby shower, just do the birthdays. And then she said, you're so mean. But she was laughing about it. So, yeah. Yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of in my life? I would say being there for my family. Being a mentally and emotionally strong person. Family has gone through a lot of challenges, and a lot of times I've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and make sure everything goes accordingly. So I'd say more than anything, making sure I'm there for my family. Okay. I think that's everything I need to say. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Have a good one. Okay. I can take this off? Okay. You wouldn't be the first one to tell her that. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off.

         "I've been feeling really down for about six months now. It started after a major project at work fell through, and since then, it's just been a constant heavy sadness, like a dark cloud hanging over me. I often feel this overwhelming sense of hopelessness and guilt, especially about not being productive or feeling like a burden to my family. Sometimes I just feel numb, and other times I get really irritable, even snapping at my family, which I regret. I've completely lost interest in things I used to love, like reading or hiking; there's just no joy or pleasure in anything anymore.\n\nMy daily life has been severely impacted. I have trouble falling asleep, often waking up multiple times during the night, but then I also oversleep significantly, yet still feel completely exhausted. My appetite is gone; I eat very little, sometimes even forgetting to eat at all. I've been isolating myself a lot, cancelling plans with friends because I just don't have the energy to socialize, and I feel like I'm pushing them away. Even basic tasks like showering feel like a monumental effort. I have no energy, struggle to get out of bed, and can't concentrate on anything, especially work, which has caused my productivity to plummet. I've missed a lot of work and I'm worried about losing my job. My family has been trying to help and my partner is worried about me, but it's hard to accept help when I feel this way. I often find myself just staying in bed, watching TV mindlessly, or avoiding responsibilities, and I've been having some really dark thoughts.",

         " Are there any parameters? I mean, should I just talk naturally or just however I'm comfortable? Whatever you're comfortable, just talk naturally. I'm going to go ahead and just fix this. Just one spot, sorry. Okay, great. One last thing. Perfect. So again, she'll let you know when she's done. I'm going to hand you the doorbell, but I'll try to keep an eye on the time as well. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay. Where are you from originally? I was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA? Originally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA is very has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just sort of I don't know if estranged is the right word but I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. How hard is that? It's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy. So it doesn't really answer your question but Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tape and I'm not sure what I'm doing. I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? I have certain I do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really it soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed. When was the last time that happened? A few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing. How did you decide to do that? I've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me. How hard is that? It's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good. I see what you mean. How are you at controlling your temper? Good. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. What's something you feel guilty about? A lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really really that I really wanted to work and I I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and not and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty that was pretty tough. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Well some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were. I think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself. I mean it's it's possible I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Well it's it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. That's good. How do you cope with them? Um well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using I'm the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet. Are they triggered by something? They're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to to this. It's really it's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't I don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like I would I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep. I don't know. I get up, I toss and turn all night. You know and now it's just it's yeah I don't sleep too great right now. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad. Okay. How long ago were you diagnosed? I think three, three, four years ago. It was when I I had been given taken stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So yeah that was kind of a turning point. But unfortunately it happened after everything went bad. So How did you feel in that moment? In the moment I don't know. I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm that I had that I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain and I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now What got you to say help? What got you to say help? What got you to say help? Um Um There really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either I was I was self-medicating I was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but It was at least that and not firing me. But but but yeah but so I got help but it was. But it wasn't soon enough. Not not as much as I should. I go to a couple of meetings. I go to I go to a so that I can. You know keep control of that aspect to to and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately you know being unemployed my employment ran out you know I'm I'm you know I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. Somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. And then there's you. Right. Well like I said I mean. Just the talk I mean that let's just take the A.A. for example because that's probably the closest closest for them seeing with therapy right now. Just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can do. Something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. You know better than I that I have been. I mean. It's sort of it has its ups and downs. You know I'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just I have to deal with real life which is. It has its own challenge. Yeah. Yeah. It can be tough to find a good job. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um. It was probably you know a couple of years ago. Um. I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. Is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree. And we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and. I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and. Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So. What are you most proud of? Probably the. Probably this. Educate educational series I did. Educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about. And about the world around them so that I feel like that was a really good thing to do. The world. my job. It was a, we were trying to come up with new ideas for, because we would put together videos and stuff to give to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot to it so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend? I don't know. I don't know, it's been a while since I've really thought about that. I don't know, would I go somewhere? Would I? I don't know. Thank you. Howdy. Thank you.",

I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after everything, after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but It was at least that and not firing me. But yeah, so I got help but it wasn't soon enough. Not as much as I should. I go to a couple of meetings. I go to a so that I can. You know keep control of that aspect and there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately you know being unemployed my employment ran out you know I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. So I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. And then there's you. Right. Well like I said I mean. Just the talk I mean that let's just take the A.A. for example because that's probably the closest for them seeing with therapy right now. Just saying stuff out loud is just like getting the stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of drugs you know I mean you're taking all that stuff that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can do. Something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. You know better than I that I have been. I mean. It's sort of it has its ups and downs. You know I'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to being self sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just I have to deal with real life which is. It has its own challenge. Yeah. It can be tough to find a good job. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um. It was probably you know a couple of years ago. Um. I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. Is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree. And we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger life that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and. I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and. Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So. What are you most proud of? Probably this educational series I did. Educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about the world around them so that I feel like that was a really good thing to do. The world. my job. It was a, we were trying to come up with new ideas for, because we would put together videos and stuff to give to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot to it so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend? I don't know, it's been a while since I've really thought about that. I don't know, would I go somewhere? Would I? I don't know. Thank you. Howdy.",
         "I'm feeling a little pensive and down today. My old life, before I lost my job, weighs on my mind a lot; I miss my friends and relationships and feel like I failed, unable to get back on my feet. Most of my anger is directed inward. I still feel immense guilt about a past relationship that ended badly because I wasn't on the right medication, causing everything to spiral out of control. I dwell on things constantly, taking little details and thinking about them until it drives me crazy. Even things from high school can still make me feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, and ashamed, like I'm right back there.\n\nMy sleep isn't great; I'm a very light sleeper, tossing and turning all night, and I'm really starting to feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. I'm also pretty estranged from my family and old friends. My mental state significantly impacted my work, leading to me being laid off after being institutionalized once or twice. It makes me angry that I lost everything due to brain chemistry and inadequate help from previous doctors.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression about three or four years ago, though I was on anxiety medication for years before that. Now, with the right medication, I still get upset and depressed, but I don't completely lose it for days at a time like I used to. For a long time, I coped by drinking to slow my mind down. Now, to manage my thoughts, I have to keep my brain constantly occupied, often doing two things at once, like playing a game on my phone while watching TV. I wish I could just let the thoughts come and deal with them, but I can't yet. These thoughts are triggered by everything – anything I see or hear can connect back to them, and I never get a break.\n\nI go to AA meetings, which has a therapy aspect, and I have a psychiatrist, though I only see her a few times a year to keep my medication coming since I'm unemployed. Saying things out loud, trying to make sense of the mess in my head, is a big step. While the chemical parts of my depression feel more under control now, I'm still dealing with real-world problems like applying for jobs daily and never getting a response, which makes it hard to feel self-sufficient. The last time I felt truly happy was a couple of years ago, when everything was going well, and I felt like a normal person, and I don't know if I'll ever feel that again.",

         " Okay, awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. You know, how about yourself? I'm great. Awesome. Where are you from? I'm from Guatemala. My parents migrated here to the United States when I was like three years old. So, yeah. Really? Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been there, actually. I haven't been back to my hometown since forever. Why? Just, you know, I have all my family here, my mom, my dad, my cousins, aunts, uncles. So, practically, I have my life here. So, I probably, I mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know, just my curiosity hasn't, you know, gone there, I guess. Okay. What's your favorite part about Guatemala? I love the people. Everyone's nice. I love the diversity, you know. There's different types of people and imaginations out there. You know, everything's just great. You know, everyone's different, you know. No one's like the same, at least to some aspects. And I love the scenery. I love, you know, the mountains. They're beautiful, you know, great for hikes, you know, taking out, you know, the dog, the family, you know. It's nice. It's pretty active. Yeah. What is your favorite smog? The smog. I don't like the smog. It's just, you know, if you go out further out, you know, you could tell by the air, you know, or, you know, everything's clear. The sky's bluer. But other than that, like, you know, in traffic, nobody likes traffic, I think. Yeah. But yeah, that's, you know, pretty much LA is pretty nice, you know. I like it. That's good. What did you study at school? Well, I was studying just basic, you know. I'm not sure exactly what I want to be. So it's just kind of, you know, here and there, just jumping through hoops and stuff. So not really set yet. It's still trying to find my interest, I suppose. What's your dream job? My dream job. That's a good one. I love working with children. So I would say probably a child psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what's going on in the young minds and, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, make children, you know, or help, you know, help them, you know, grow up in a positive way, I suppose, instead of, like, going the wrong track. Yeah. I just, you know, help children. Is it just so high-five or up-going? It depends. It depends on the situation I'm in. Sometimes, you know, I could be, like, super outgoing and just, like, you know, and sometimes I could just, I could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention, you know, if I'm, like, in class or whatever. I don't really, like, and there's everyone talking. I just, I prefer just to stay away from that, you know, because I need something else to concentrate on something else. You know, there's, like, a moment in time for everything, I suppose. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm being there, I turn on the first page of the screen favorite. Hey, I know it's not blind, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to kick my feet up on the couch and, like, read a good book, you know, just get my mind going to another, you know, galaxy or universe or situation, you know. It's pretty fun, you know, just, you know, reading and then just having yourself relaxed and, you know, feeling good. That's great. Yeah, it is. It's just fun. I love reading. How are you at controlling your own mood? I'm okay with it. I'm not, like, the best, you know, temper-controlling person there is out there. You know, I try my best and I guess that's all I could do until I keep doing better eventually. But I'm not, like, the best. I mean, I sometimes I do have my outbursts, you know. But, you know, I guess that's everyone. I'm not sure. When was the last time you argued with him? Ah, huh. That's a good question. That's a good question. I don't remember. Let's see. Honestly, I can't recall. Maybe. My goodness. I don't know. Sometimes I'm very passive. That's just like let things go because, I mean, what's the point of making a big deal out of things? You know, so, huh, I don't know. I honestly I can't tell you that at this moment. Why don't we talk about that later? Sure. Yeah, probably come back to it. What's something with your relationship? Um, huh. Well, I guess when I was younger, I, you know, could have been better older sister and I wasn't. And that makes me feel guilty for sure. You know, I could have been a better sister. Better role model. But I'm trying my best now, so I'm trying to make things better. And it's working. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your ex-wife. Oh, I guess, huh. Hmm. I don't know. I mean, I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life. So if I erase something, then it's just there's something of me in my present self or, you know, that would change. And I don't know. I'm pretty OK with the person that I am now. I mean, you know, I don't think I would change an event. You know, I'm OK with what, you know, ups and downs and good and bad that has happened. OK. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. But I am kind of like an explorer, I guess. I love to explore, like, even the smallest things. Like if I go hiking, I go off trail and, you know, just find my way up to the top, you know, somehow some way and just make it, you know, traveling. I would love to do that. But I don't know, just, you know, always circumstances in my life that doesn't, you know, always something, you know, I get married, children, you know, and all this. So it's kind of like, you know, it would be nice, I guess, you know, it would be nice. You know, I love camping. That's kind of like, you know, taking a few days trips out there, camping and fishing. Yeah. It was this summer, you know, me and my husband went camping and it was really nice. It was just me and him, you know, and it was like no one. And it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake. And, you know, it was it was really nice. It was just, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was. It was. It was really fun. It was like I would love to do it again, you know, right now. It would be great, you know, just going out there. It's just I love that venture of things and the nature and just life and, you know, overall. Yeah. It's easy, but lately I haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because I don't know, just, you know, just I'm laying there and I'm just like trying to go to sleep and I'm just like, oh, but eventually I do. You know, I just I probably like need to position myself in a different side of the bed. Like sometimes I'm in the headboard and I'm like, oh, I got to go to the other side. And once I position myself, then I just like go to sleep, you know, but it just I got to find the right position for me. Yeah. Um, I'm tired. I get tired throughout the day, you know, but I kind of try to shake it off, you know, and just kind of like feel like it's a new day, you know, and just try to make the day that I have as great as possible, you know, and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of, you know. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, it's OK. I try to make it the best, I guess. If not, then I just go to sleep throughout the day, which sucks. But yeah. No. No. I've been feeling good. Yeah, I've been feeling really good. You know, a lot of things in my life have, you know, I'm having a really good year so far. So I'm very happy with that. You know, everything's, you know, going good, you know. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. It is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible. But that's just nature. My immune system has to work harder. Super happy was when the doctor told me I was pregnant. You know, I was really, really happy about that. And I was just like, oh, you know, that was really, really good. You know, very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby. And, oh, that's very overwhelming. And it's scary at the same time. I've never really like, you know, but yeah, I'm very happy. Yeah. I don't know. I guess just me myself, you know, like, you know, I could, you know, just be myself and that's it. You know, just I can't really, you know, say I have a specific thing, I guess. I mean, it depends on the person that meets me to tell me. I can't really tell myself like, oh, I'm this, I'm that, you know, just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to, you know, tell me or, you know, compliment me or whatnot. Yeah. Oh, nothing, I think. Um, like I said, I'm happy with the person I am right now. And, you know, my flaws or whatever, you know, I might have, I don't know, whatever flaw people see in me and it's OK. You know, I'm OK with it. Whatever it just I'm not going to I can't change myself for the likings of other people. I have only one body and one life. So, yeah, yeah, that's it. Ah, just my childhood with my sisters and my family. But, you know, it's, you know, you learn from that, you learn from the past and you kind of feel like, hey, you know, maybe I should be a better role model, you know, for my children. And so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve. Um, just smile and be happy, you know, and whatever hard things happen, you know, you're going to get through them eventually, you know, the only thing you can't do is to be happy. You can't, I don't know, you can't, you know, go back on his death. You know, you could, you know, a heartbreak or whatever. But, you know, as long as I'm alive, I still got to keep going. Yeah. I don't know. That's pretty, huh, most proud of. I guess that I'm trying my best to be the best I could be. And that's pretty powerful. You know, I'm, you know, I try to be, you know, a better person each day and try to like, you know, improve myself every day as much as I can. You know, that would probably be something I could be super proud of, you know, as much as I can. Very hard. I'm not going to lie. It is really hard, you know, because I can't say, you know, it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good. You know, and, you know, it's always challenges and everything that goes, you know, in your life. But, you know, it's just it's sometimes, you know, hard, you know, and sometimes it comes easy, you know, after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try, you know. So, yeah. You know, loving, friendly, outgoing, you know, adventures, I guess. I don't know. That's what they say. Just, you know, that's them. Like, you know, but that's what at least what I try to be. You know, at least I try to give the best foot forward always as much as possible. You know, even sometimes even if I'm having a rough day, I'm just like, oh, you know, you know, I just I don't want to be bad. You know, I just I don't want to take it out on anyone or anything, you know. Yeah. Yeah. How do you spend your ideal weekend? My ideal weekend. Usually I like going to the park. I like sitting down in like a tree under a tree, actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there, have my dog and like read a book. And, you know, sometimes if I don't have my dog, like there's little scrolls running around and they like me to feed them. So that's pretty neat, you know, just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise, I guess, because there's not silence. You know, the wind and the cars and, you know, it's just it's really neat. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.",

You know, even sometimes if I'm having a rough day, I'm just like, oh, you know, you know, I just don't want to be bad. You know, I don't want to take it out on anyone or anything, you know. Yeah. Yeah. How do you spend your ideal weekend? My ideal weekend. Usually I like going to the park. I like sitting down in like a tree, actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there, have my dog and like read a book. And, you know, sometimes if I don't have my dog, like there's little scrolls running around and they like me to feed them. So that's pretty neat, you know, just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise, I guess, because there's not silence. You know, the wind and the cars and, you know, it's just it's really neat. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.",
         "I've been feeling really good lately, actually, and I'm having a very happy year so far with everything going well, especially since I found out I'm pregnant, which makes me very excited, though it's also overwhelming and scary. However, I do have some challenges. Lately, I haven't been able to fall asleep right away at night; I just lie there trying to find the right position. This makes me tired throughout the day, and sometimes I end up sleeping during the day, which I don't like. I try to shake off the tiredness and make the day as great as possible. I also admit I'm not the best at controlling my mood and sometimes have outbursts, but I try my best to improve. A past feeling that makes me feel guilty is not having been a better older sister when I was younger, but I'm working to make things better now. Despite any hard things that happen, I believe I'll get through them and I always try to smile and be happy, striving to be the best person I can be every day. Even on rough days, I make sure not to take it out on anyone. To relax, I love reading a good book to get my mind going, and I also enjoy camping and being out in nature.",

         " Since there's nothing else Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty okay. Thanks for asking. How are you? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm from here in LA. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Cool. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? What do you enjoy about traveling? I love traveling. I like experiencing new things. I think that would be nice. Despite the fact that I said I like the familiarity of LA, there's also fun in discovering new things. So I think when I travel, that's what I like to do, just check new things out. If I could make a living doing that, that would be great. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips? Okay, well, let's see. The last trip I took... Let me think of one more exciting trip. Well, my family is from Eastern Europe, so one of the trips I took with my parents when I was 14 was I went to Austria, Hungary, and Romania, and getting to see some of those old... I'd been a few times before, but it was when I was little, so I don't really have too much memory. Plus, I didn't really process things quite the same as when I was kind of more of age. So I got to see my family's old hometown. We have a family tomb, so I got to see that. Then just these old buildings and just a different way of life. I really like that, seeing my parents' old friends. So that was pretty fun. It was very different. It was really my first time being taken away from my home environment. I left them all the school year, so it was just like going from suburban America to traveling around, taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old hundreds of year old towns. I don't know if it was for everyone. I don't know. It would be great for everybody, but I really enjoyed it. Awesome. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? That's a good question. I probably one of the things I do is either turn on a rerun of a sitcom. I watch The Office a lot, so I kind of know when that's on. So I'll turn that on, just kind of zone out a little bit to familiar characters and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason. Or maybe eating some kind of comfort food. I try not to eat too much fast food at all, but in and out, I really like going there. So if I have to unwind once every few months, maybe I'll do that. Or I really like to read, especially like I'll read the day's events. That really relaxes me for some reason. Even if it's reading about some conflict going on somewhere in the world, I still read the headlines. I really like to know what's going on. That kind of centers me. So I really enjoy that. That's something I do to relax. How are you at controlling your temper? I would say I'm pretty great at it, although I think my nature makes it pretty easy. I don't get very upset easily at all. So it's not much of a challenge to control my temper. Yeah, I don't really have anger issues. It's difficult for me to get angry. So I don't really have much trouble with that at all. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody was probably...I don't even know. Small disagreements I might have had with family or friends about things. But just a full-on argument, I can't even remember. It's been years. I don't really argue too much. I try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my personal life. I don't really see anything to be gained by it. I naturally repel away from it. So I don't have much to say about arguing. What's something you feel guilty about? I say what you mean. Tell me about me then. I say what you mean. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I say what you mean. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. What's something you feel guilty about? I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was

just...I rammed into her old one and I was back to her old one and I was back to her old one and the確erboiaje월 later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job uh... allows me for to be pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh... i wish i could were like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up so one or two every night uh... and is just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or what not asleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i wish i were more uh... able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven and then sleep and wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later waking up later i'm pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health wise i feel good uh... you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh... uh... everything is great so far i i've absolutely no no real complaints uh... as far as i'm feeling on myself for anything like that no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that uh... everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing uh... kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort is this happened there is happening no no well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh... yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things uh... in my life uh... yeah like i said i i do regret uh... you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh... i hung out with a lot of friends yeah i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us work we just uh... you know we we got high every day uh... or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh... it was a kind of like a throwaway period of my life i would say that uh... it's important to to to engage with the world i think i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to uh... recognize the people around you for what they are you know what what kind of potential you know future activities that you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh... i would say also that uh... can try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that uh... that approach is kind of fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know uh... just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule life is in a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and uh... thinking that things will fall into place well i i guess when people i i don't especially uh... take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that at least for myself i sort of five things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh... group work that done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is kinda picked apart or scrutinized i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should uh... was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh... somebody with much less it was three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it and there was somebody just out of college you know uh... went over what we had done and you know just kinda rewording things and it seems just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of changing things and i can't take personal fence to that just uh... because i thought i had a lot more experience more education and uh... it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just uh... i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to necessarily redo all our work uh... or or even to uh... now not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh... uh... proofread i guess that to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know it was kind of like uh... an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but it wasn't our call most memorable experiences uh... well i guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my uh... the first real trip i took by myself uh... i i took the uh... the amtrak to new mexico and i was out there exploring things uh... for about ten days on my own uh... so that was kind of the longest period of time up till that point and i was in my i was twenty three maybe at the time that i had had really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time uh... it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh... you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions uh... and it was a lot of fun uh... uh... why been very happy recently i mean for that i'm getting married in a few months i got engaged on labor day uh... in two thousand twelve thanks so i was uh... that was a very happy day this this whole process you know uh... meeting someone and we we kind of progressed very quickly realize where we recognize where we were so i've been a pretty happy state the past uh... well it's been eleven months now but uh... yes so i think that the day we got engaged and we we shared with our family i think those have been very happy times uh... new years was happy you know i've been a happy period of my life right now so yeah thank you uh... with the sort of uh... sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh... also uh... you know uh... helpful calm relaxed maybe uh... intelligent uh... you know likes to recycle i know that's a subject that they would say uh... and what else i think that uh... best friend might say that uh... i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats they might describe as a people person i mean an animal person excuse me i also you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans uh... i'd say one of the most part of my life i i i'm pretty happy with the level education i've gotten i'm also going back and starting the fall and starting a phd programs i'm happy about that happy about you know breaking some of that habits from the past i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that uh... you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't pride is the right word but uh... my relationships with family and friends are all very good uh... i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change and i'm happy and proud of that no problem have a good day thank you goodbye okay All right.",

         "I've been feeling incredibly down, like a heavy cloud is constantly over me. It's more than just sadness; it's a profound lack of joy, even in things I used to love. I often feel numb, but then overwhelming sadness can hit me. There's a lot of guilt too, for not being able to just 'snap out of it' or be there for my loved ones. Sometimes I feel completely hopeless about things ever getting better, and I can be quite irritable.\n\nThis feeling has really impacted my daily life. My sleep is a mess – I struggle to fall asleep, wake up early, and still feel exhausted. My appetite changes; sometimes I eat too much, other times nothing at all, and food just doesn't taste good. I have zero motivation for anything. It's incredibly hard to even get out of bed or do basic tasks like showering. I've withdrawn from friends and family, avoiding calls and cancelling plans because I feel like such a burden. My work is suffering because I can't focus, and I'm constantly tired.\n\nI find myself just lying in bed, staring at the ceiling a lot. I try to push through, but it truly feels like I'm walking through mud. This has been going on for months now; it started subtly a while ago and has just gotten worse.",

         " Nice, I have my hair. You see what you look like, you're like, oh my god, I look dumb. So this picture is not based on a real woman at all. No, they used, it's not based on an actual person. Okay, so when she's done, I'll just wait for a flash in our system. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people and based them on my experience. I'm not a bear but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'd love to give you questions and insights. And since you're a baby, your interests are fully confirmed. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. It's still morning, so. Where are you from originally? I'm from the East Coast, Massachusetts. Really? Yes. When did you move to LA? I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents. Pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been back there. The last time I was back there was three years ago for Christmas. How does it compare to LA? LA is very hustle and bustle. There's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA. In which back east, the East Coast, the thought pattern is a lot different. You know your neighbors, you're friendly to your neighbors and you're kind to anybody that you see in the street. So, yeah. How would you say it was a period that you feel alone? Well, since I was a kid, I was fairly young. At first it was rough. I was getting in trouble a little bit in school. But after all that surpassed, I did fine in high school and stuff and even took some college courses. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, I love the beach and I love the mountains. I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach. I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy. Nice. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not at all. Why? Just not interested. I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger. Went to Ensenada. But other than that, I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what's been going on lately overseas. Okay. What did you study in school? Actually, child psychology. And I was in the nursing program for a little bit. But I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. What are you doing? That's right. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? I don't have one. To be honest, I admire people that are doing the job that they love. I mean, like football players. They love playing football and they get paid all that money. How great is that? Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I'm pretty outgoing. When I meet somebody at first, I might be a little bit reserved because we all, when we meet somebody, pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not. But once I've decided that I like that person or whatever, I talk a lot. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? I like watching movies. I used to like reading, but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great, so it's hard to get into a good book. How are you at control of your temper? Not good at times. I have some outbursts every once in a while. It depends on how angry I get. When was the last time you argued with someone? Yesterday. It was with my partner. Actually, to be honest, I don't remember what it was about. Sometimes people can have an ugly attitude, and I don't appreciate that. If I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever, I'm going to stand up for myself. Do you have problems with your partner? At times, some people may be turned off of my personality because I'm very opinionated. I say what's on my mind. I do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature. But I won't be bullied, and I won't back down if I feel like I'm being challenged. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in with your partner. Last year, my mother died. I wish I handled that differently. Is it uncomfortable when you talk about it? It upsets me. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see. I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that will upset me more. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That is terrible. Sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem, especially when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day, you're tired. But staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I get up and then I'm wide awake. I'll go out in the living room, turn on the TV, and watch TV. I think I'll get three to four hours sleep. Maybe because I do have a lot on my mind, thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and all this other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it. It's not difficult, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes on overtime mode, it just affects everything, your concentration, your sleep, your eating, everything. What are you like when you're grouchy? I'm a little grouchy, especially in the morning. I'm not a morning person. I like the nights, but I don't like the mornings. It's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee. Other than that, I'm okay. How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been depressed for quite some time, and I'm still having difficulty. After my mother died four months later, my uncle died. I had two deaths last year, so I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. Just recently, I've started pursuing interests that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened. Have you ever spent a day in the living room or the bathroom? I might get angry a little easier. I sleep a lot. I eat. I overeat. I get tired very easily because I don't get much sleep. Sometimes it's hard. It seems like I'm struggling to get through the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I was diagnosed quite some time ago. Probably 10 to 15 years ago. It's just something I've never gotten over. I don't know whether or not you can, so I've always taken the medicine. What kind of medicine did you take? I was arguing with everybody, my family, my friends, and stuff like that. I was feeling desperate and hopeless. I had attempted to take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized. Then they started treating me. I started seeing a therapist. Are you going to a therapist? Well, right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance, they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. But I am working with a friend of mine who knows some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist. I don't know if that's really going to help me. It depends on what kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on, and you're thinking, my God, what good is this? The other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions. What sort of changes have you noticed in your therapy? Like I said, I haven't been going to therapy recently, just psychiatry, just medication. There's been no changes, really. I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away. I was her caregiver. Even though a lot of times I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I still was a heck of a lot happier than I am now. How many of us in the last few years felt really happy? I would say when my son was born, years ago. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I'm not a parent anymore. He passed away. That was difficult as well. I'm sorry you're late. What would you say as a mother about telling you? I'm extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done, but sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained. Those qualities are admirable in people that can keep their word and be responsible. Excuse me? Oh, I have lots of regrets. Things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about. I met somebody once in my life that had that saying, and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. You can't go back and make changes. It's too late, so why dwell on the situation? Sometimes it's a lot easier said than done. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'm not the advice kind of get person. I don't really give my friends any kind of advice. I find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway, so why bother? I just state my opinion. That's all. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating. After my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive. I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot. Sleep, eat, sleep, eat. Now I'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight because it's very unhealthy for me. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I'm trying to think it's been a long time. Actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy. I haven't been to a movie in ages. I used to go out shopping all the time. I don't now. So it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now. Tell me how you spend your weekend. My weekends, like on Saturday I'm usually working. On Sunday is usually clean up day. Do your laundry, clean up the house, run some errands, go shopping for food. That kind of thing. If I was younger it would be fun to go out clubbing or whatever, but I'm too old for that now. What are you most proud of in your life? Really there's nothing that I can think of. There's nothing that I can be proud of. What are some things that you do that you can give me? A good comedy or whatever. I like to watch that. Sometimes my partner might do something stupid, which I like because I make fun of them. But that's it. Maybe go out for a walk on the beach. That's it. Okay. No problem. Thank you. Bye. Does somebody talk for her or is she just talking to me really? I'll actually explain to you how she works once we're finished up with the study. Okay. Can you actually take that headset off? Thank you.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nHi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people and based them on my experience. I'm not a bear but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'd love to give you questions and insights. And since you're a baby, your interests are fully confirmed. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. It's still morning, so. Where are you from originally? I'm from the East Coast, Massachusetts. Really? Yes. When did you move to LA? I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents. Pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been back there. The last time I was back there was three years ago for Christmas. How does it compare to LA? LA is very hustle and bustle. There's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA. In which back east, the East Coast, the thought pattern is a lot different. You know your neighbors, you're friendly to your neighbors and you're kind to anybody that you see in the street. So, yeah. How would you say it was a period that you feel alone? Well, since I was a kid, I was fairly young. At first it was rough. I was getting in trouble a little bit in school. But after all that surpassed, I did fine in high school and stuff and even took some college courses. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, I love the beach and I love the mountains. I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach. I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy. Nice. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not at all. Why? Just not interested. I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger. Went to Ensenada. But other than that, I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what's been going on lately overseas. Okay. What did you study in school? Actually, child psychology. And I was in the nursing program for a little bit. But I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. What are you doing? That's right. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? I don't have one. To be honest, I admire people that are doing the job that they love. I mean, like football players. They love playing football and they get paid all that money. How great is that? Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I'm pretty outgoing. When I meet somebody at first, I might be a little bit reserved because we all, when we meet somebody, pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not. But once I've decided that I like that person or whatever, I talk a lot. What do you do to relax? Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. I like watching movies. I used to like reading, but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great, so it's hard to get into a good book. How are you at control of your temper? Not good at times. I have some outbursts every once in a while. It depends on how angry I get. When was the last time you argued with someone? Yesterday. It was with my partner. Actually, to be honest, I don't remember what it was about. Sometimes people can have an ugly attitude, and I don't appreciate that. If I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever, I'm going to stand up for myself. Do you have problems with your partner? At times, some people may be turned off of my personality because I'm very opinionated. I say what's on my mind. I do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature. But I won't be bullied, and I won't back down if I feel like I'm being challenged. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in with your partner. Last year, my mother died. I wish I handled that differently. Is it uncomfortable when you talk about it? It upsets me. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see. I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that will upset me more. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That is terrible. Sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem, especially when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day, you're tired. But staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I get up and then I'm wide awake. I'll go out in the living room, turn on the TV, and watch TV. I think I'll get three to four hours sleep. Maybe because I do have a lot on my mind, thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and all this other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it. It's not difficult, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes on overtime mode, it just affects everything, your concentration, your sleep, your eating, everything. What are you like when you're grouchy? I'm a little grouchy, especially in the morning. I'm not a morning person. I like the nights, but I don't like the mornings. It's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee. Other than that, I'm okay. How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been depressed for quite some time, and I'm still having difficulty. After my mother died four months later, my uncle died. I had two deaths last year, so I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. Just recently, I've started pursuing interests that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened. Have you ever spent a day in the living room or the bathroom? I might get angry a little easier. I sleep a lot. I eat. I overeat. I get tired very easily because I don't get much sleep. Sometimes it's hard. It seems like I'm struggling to get through the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I was diagnosed quite some time ago. Probably 10 to 15 years ago. It's just something I've never gotten over. I don't know whether or not you can, so I've always taken the medicine. I was arguing with everybody, my family, my friends, and stuff like that. I was feeling desperate and hopeless. I had attempted to take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized. Then they started treating me. I started seeing a therapist. Are you going to a therapist? Well, right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance, they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. But I am working with a friend of mine who knows some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist. I don't know if that's really going to help me. It depends on what kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on, and you're thinking, my God, what good is this? The other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions. What sort of changes have you noticed in your therapy? Like I said, I haven't been going to therapy recently, just psychiatry, just medication. There's been no changes, really. I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away. I was her caregiver. Even though a lot of times I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I still was a heck of a lot happier than I am now. How many of us in the last few years felt really happy? I would say when my son was born, years ago. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I'm not a parent anymore. He passed away. That was difficult as well. I'm sorry you're late. What would you say as a mother about telling you? I'm extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done, but sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained. Those qualities are admirable in people that can keep their word and be responsible. Excuse me? Oh, I have lots of regrets. Things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about. I met somebody once in my life that had that saying, and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. You can't go back and make changes. It's too late, so why dwell on the situation? Sometimes it's a lot easier said than done. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'm not the advice kind of get person. I don't really give my friends any kind of advice.

After my mother died last year, and then my uncle four months later, I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. I was doing great before my mom passed away, even though being her caregiver often felt overwhelming.\n\nMy mood is often low; I can be grouchy, especially in the mornings, and I might get angry a little easier. I was feeling desperate and hopeless at one point, and years ago, I even attempted to take my own life, which led to hospitalization and starting treatment. I was diagnosed with depression probably 10 to 15 years ago, and I've always taken medication prescribed by my psychiatrist. I'm not seeing a therapist right now because of insurance, but a friend is helping me look for options. I'm not sure if therapy will really help, as I've found some therapists just listen without offering tools. There haven't been any changes recently with just medication.\n\nMy daily functioning is significantly impacted. Getting a good night's sleep is terrible; I might fall asleep, but staying asleep is hard. I often wake up wide awake and only get three to four hours of sleep, probably because my mind goes into overtime, thinking about bills and work stress. This affects everything – my concentration, sleep, and eating. I sleep a lot and overeat, especially after my mom died, which has led to weight gain. I'm on a diet now to try and lose it.\n\nMy concentration level hasn't been great lately, making it hard to get into a good book. Sometimes it feels like I'm struggling just to get through the day. I used to enjoy going out shopping and to movies, but I don't anymore. I just try to keep my mind busy. Recently, I've started pursuing some interests I used to do, but haven't in a year. It's been a long time since I've felt content or happy with who I am or what I'm doing. There's really nothing I can think of that I'm proud of in my life. I also tend to argue with family and friends more easily. I wish I had handled things differently after my mother died, but it's too upsetting to talk about. My son also passed away, which was very difficult. I try to relax by watching movies or the fish tank screen saver, and sometimes walking on the beach.",

         " Okay. All right. Thanks. Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks. Hi. Yeah. Go ahead. Okay. I grew up in Wisconsin and I grew up in the Colorado for a bit and then I lived overseas for a little while and then I moved to California. I moved here at the end of June of last year, so I guess it's been eight months, something like that. Yeah. At the most, probably twice a year. Well, my hometown is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms. So the opposite of LA. Okay. It's a good question. I always wanted to live in California, but I had been living in the Central Coast and I just had been coming down to LA once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff. So yeah, things were changing. In Santa Cruz for me, the client I had who was really the main financial source I had, that relationship ended, so I was totally free to move and I thought, well, I guess I'll give LA a try and see what happens. So I gave it a shot and here I am. No, not at all. It's a very, very big city. I lived in Dublin in Ireland, which is also a big city, but European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy. Yeah, so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city and the people that are traveling and, well. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I love to travel. I love it. I lived in Ireland and I traveled. I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica. I love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures, and also not just seeing what's different, but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go. Sure. Well, I guess I'm trying to think which was my favorite. I mean, there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both, but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days and we went to three different locations. We went up in the Atlas Mountains, which are beautiful. Yeah, it's a really, really cool culture. It was fun. What was the most memorable experience? My trip to Ireland, I actually visited there, which is why I decided to move there. So my most memorable moment of that trip, I mean, there's probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being on a bus and leaving Dublin and going just down to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is. Everyone sees pictures of Ireland or you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous, but you actually get there and experience it. The pictures don't do it justice. It was incredible. Awesome. What did you study at school? I have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies. Are you still working on that? No, I use my English and psychology. I work in marketing communications. I actually do sales. So yeah, the psychology definitely comes into play and so does my, I guess my undergrad degree in English, but really I took that on and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I wasn't wanting to teach. What made you decide to do that? I guess I'm not clear on the question. Let's come back to that later. Okay. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? Wow. My dream job is being a motivational speaker and trainer and coach and traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship is pretty good actually. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who was sporadic. I saw her sporadically growing up. I lived, my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together. So I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with. But I got in communication with my biological mother last May and we've been cleared things up and have been in communication since then. How did you feel in that moment? Well, I'm not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and not just the future but in the present moment with her. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? To relax I do a number of things. I like to do yoga although I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance. I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharges my battery actually. Probably more than anything else. I like to be with friends. I love art and trying new restaurants. Yeah, all those things are both relaxing. I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life. How are you at controlling your hunger? Depends. If I'm driving, not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it. When was the last time you argued with someone? Last time I argued with somebody. Probably would have to be... Oh no, it was with the LA Times about the newspaper delivery. Yeah, that was the last time. Yeah, the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of. It didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until I don't know, afternoon, I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10.30 in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. For a service that would pay for it for every day. Yeah, I was really irritated. Then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me. I was angry with the LA Times, I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. Yeah, I was pretty frustrated. Oh wow, there are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program and it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be, we have meetings every week, classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach and that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so in that moment it just seemed to me like, oh my god I have all these people I have to be accountable to and I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was I don't know. I wasn't angry I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and you know and I talked it out with her and we got through it but yeah I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother. The hardest decision wow there's been a few. I guess moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision. No it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging but the hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family. I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that was a pretty tough decision because at that point my family had been within an hour's drive of wherever I lived an hour, hour and a half and now they were going to be a 12 hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was challenging. Oh lots of things I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado so there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single that was another factor and were interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit and then I found a job that I liked, the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and I chose to move. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That was a totally unrelated question. Relatively easily it just depends on what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11.30 then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired and I don't know how much better I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those or if I stir from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. Are they triggered by something? I'm moving out of the house that I live in right now where I take care of an elderly woman and I have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being, she's exhausting and utterly depressing. How hard is that? Living with her is pretty hard, it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again. Honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation. How have you been feeling lately? I'm like this, there's nothing I can there's no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy. Have you been diagnosed with depression? How long ago were you diagnosed? What got you to see me out? Did you feel down? Do you still get a therapy now? I don't actually, no. Why did you stop? Well I originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed, we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and then I began therapy again later on it was in my early 30's and then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland. Yeah I mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention I don't go into therapy thinking oh I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy. Huh. Wow that's pretty sad. It was at least a year ago. No that's not true it was when I saw my biological mother which was last May. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities. I'm very strong. Very strong willed. I'm very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent and I'm... Yeah. Anything I regret. I don't think so. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't think too seriously. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends. Either going out a night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar. Somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to and then I have brunch with friends and yeah I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day. What are you most proud of in your life? I am most proud of a few things. I've moved to places that I wanted to move to. I've done things that have really spoken to me. And have meant something to my heart. Achieve those goals. I've done things that I've wanted to do. Move to Ireland and move to California. That's great. Okay I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye. Just a little bit of a survey. Finish up with a quick post survey.",

For a service that would pay for it for every day. Yeah, I was really irritated. Then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me. I was angry with the LA Times, I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. Yeah, I was pretty frustrated. Oh wow, there are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program and it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be, we have meetings every week, classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach and that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so in that moment it just seemed to me like, oh my god I have all these people I have to be accountable to and I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was I don't know. I wasn't angry I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and you know and I talked it out with her and we got through it but yeah I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother. The hardest decision wow there's been a few. I guess moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision. No it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging but the hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family. I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that was a pretty tough decision because at that point my family had been within an hour's drive of wherever I lived an hour, hour and a half and now they were going to be a 12 hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was challenging. Oh lots of things I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado so there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single that was another factor and were interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit and then I found a job that I liked, the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and I chose to move. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That was a totally unrelated question. Relatively easily it just depends on what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11.30 then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired and I don't know how much better I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those or if I stir from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. Are they triggered by something? I'm moving out of the house that I live in right now where I take care of an elderly woman and I have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being, she's exhausting and utterly depressing. How hard is that? Living with her is pretty hard, it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again. Honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation. How have you been feeling lately? I'm like this, there's no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy. Do you still get a therapy now? I don't actually, no. Why did you stop? Well I originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed, we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and then I began therapy again later on it was in my early 30's and then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland. Yeah I mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention I don't go into therapy thinking oh I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy. Huh. Wow that's pretty sad. It was at least a year ago. No that's not true it was when I saw my biological mother which was last May. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities. I'm very strong. Very strong willed. I'm very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent and I'm... Yeah. Anything I regret. I don't think so. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't think too seriously. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends. Either going out a night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar. Somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to and then I have brunch with friends and yeah I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day. What are you most proud of in your life? I am most proud of a few things. I've moved to places that I wanted to move to. I've done things that have really spoken to me. And have meant something to my heart. Achieve those goals. I've done things that I've wanted to do. Move to Ireland and move to California. That's great. Okay I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye. Just a little bit of a survey. Finish up with a quick post survey.",
         "Lately, I've been feeling pretty crappy, like there's no way out of my current situation. No matter what I do, things don't seem to get any better, especially with not getting the kind of work I want and my money not working out at all. I haven't felt truly happy in a long time; the last time was about eight months ago when I saw my biological mother.\n\nMy current living situation, where I care for an elderly woman, creates a lot of anxiety. She's exhausting and utterly depressing to be around. Living with her is probably the hardest thing I've ever done, and I would never choose to do it again. Honestly, if I knew what I was getting into, I don't think I would have said yes. This situation, combined with needing to find financial means to support myself, makes me feel trapped and overwhelmed.\n\nWhile I can generally sleep through the night, I've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks, though I can usually fall back asleep. To relax, I like to do yoga, but I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance, read, and go to the ocean to stare at the waves; that really recharges my battery more than anything else. I also like being with friends, enjoying art, and trying new restaurants. When I'm feeling tense, I sometimes turn on the fish tank screensaver. I've had depression before; I stopped therapy when I was no longer depressed, and then again when I moved to Ireland. I see therapy as a way to work on specific problems and gain tools for life, not as a permanent thing.",

         " She'll ask you some stuff, but yeah, she can understand. So when she's done, she'll let you know. You can put the door up over here. Hopefully it'll work, but I'll try to... Sometimes my sister can talk to me. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me Feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Boston. Really? When did you move to LA? About 30 years ago. That's a long time. Yep. When do you go back to your hometown? Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Oh, I love living in LA. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. Why did you move to LA? Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. The beginning of the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? Broadcast journalism. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. Are you still working on that? Nope. Why? Well, it's kind of a long story but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just, once I had done that work, I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. Yeah. It could be tough to find a good job these days. Yep. What's your dream job? My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Nice. How hard is that? Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to. I don't travel so much right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like where I'm from. Uh huh. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday because I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international dateline. I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay where native dolphins live and swim. It's very isolated for the most part. I got to be there for a whole weekend pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins. They come and swim with you. It's amazing. It's just a beautiful, beautiful spot in the world. Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More shy. Why? Why? Hmm. That's a good question. Partly the first thing I think of is because I've always been that way. But maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach because I live close to the beach. So that's one of my favorite things to relax. Uh huh. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Um. I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations. But not at people directly. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. I don't know if I feel guilty about anything at the moment. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I'm not sure I have one at the moment. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That just makes me really mad. That sucks. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. You know, I didn't know that I could do it. I didn't, wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. Um. So that felt like a really difficult decision. But in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time, it was really difficult to do that. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment. So that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm great. But it's because I am worried. But you know, I'm also confident that things are going to work out. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either. Sort of like just a even keel. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, I got to go to my friend's work at the Motion Picture Academy, so I get to see all the Oscar-nominated movies. She was there one night, so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again. So that was very pleasant. Nice. How would your best friend describe you? I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. Is there anything you regret? No. I really worked hard on that. I think there are lots of things maybe I would do differently, but there's nothing that really I regret. Like what? Well, I just think that there are things that... Like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good question. Don't worry about the small stuff and save more money. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, you know, the normal things. Like I'd lose more weight and I would... I think be a little more fearless maybe. Be a little more bold. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't think I have any of those. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Well, I am self-employed so I work all the time. So my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something I enjoy. So that would be ideal at this point, my weekends, if I were really busy. What are you most proud of in your life? That I've really been able to take care of myself. And that, you know, I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do. I've done that and I don't have regrets about things. There's nothing really that feels undone in my life. Sure, there's plenty of things I still want to do. But I feel like I've done what I said I was going to do. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, that's not so great. Well, it's okay. Both my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister but they both live on the East Coast and I live in LA. And my sister has two girls so I feel very close to my nieces. Although we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers. So they have other things on their mind. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my teacher, the person I learned my holistic bodywork from. That's so good to hear. How close are you to them? What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? What would be a good mood? Usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or just spending time with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. It worked again. So now I'm going to have you move over to the other computer. So you can do a quick post survey about your experience.",

         " Okay. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions and I'll answer them. And please feel free to comment below and your answers are really comforting. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling okay. I'm a little bit tired but for the most part, I'm feeling pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills, which is out in the San Fernando Valley. I was born there. And then I moved to Lomita, which is in Los Angeles County, about probably around 1993. So, I'm 23 now. So, it's about what, 19 years or so I've been living there. What are some things you really like about LA? Some things that I really like, I would have to say, you know, the beach. You know, not so much the traffic. I don't really care for that. But definitely, you know, just kind of like the nightlife. You know, just people in general. I like conversing with others. So, yeah. I see what you mean. Right. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, actually I do. I mean, I can't see your shoes. But yeah, actually I do travel a lot. I've been to places like Hawaii. I've been to the Caribbean. I've been to, let's see, you know, just different places like Arizona. I've been to Oregon, Washington. Pretty much all over, I would say. But usually mainly like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico as well. What do you enjoy about traveling? I think it's just the experience, you know. Like you can kind of experience the culture, different people, you know. Just the whole background, the scenery. It's just, you know, it's something new to experience, I would say. Something that, you know, people haven't seen before. And what's your favorite part of your trips? Well, let's see. I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago. That was back in December. It was around Christmas time, New Year's. So that was pretty fun. We went to a couple different islands. We went to, let's see, I think it was Kauai. We went to Oahu, Maui, you know, places like that. Nice. What's one thing you're most memorable seeing? You know, I would have to say that, you know, probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean. You know, just like I said before, the whole experience factor. Just seeing, you know, new, different things. Things that are unique. What did you study at school? I actually study journalism right now. In my final semester. So I'm about to graduate. A couple months. That's great. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, it's kind of funny because, you know, I started off at a, you know, a two-year community college. And so, you know, I was going into like business management. Something to do with, you know, I think basically accounting. But, you know, I kind of figured that wasn't for me. So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't, I mean, you know, I'd probably still be sitting at a desk. But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. I would almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. So. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. You know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back. Other times I kind of, it's not so much like I go into my shell, but, you know, at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't, I've never met them before. So it's one of those things that kind of, yeah, kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because, you know, I can neither be talk, very talkative or at times, you know, I can be a little bit shy. But, you know, once I get the conversation going, I'm fairly talkative. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? You know, usually I would listen to music or, you know, maybe just, you know, kind of go for a drive or, you know, hang out with my friends. You know, just something to just to kind of, you know, ease that, you know, because, you know, like I said, sometimes you get a little bit tense and you just want to relax and, you know, just do the things that you enjoy. So. How are you at controlling your temper? You know, I've actually been better with that. A couple years back, you know, there was points where like I pretty much couldn't control my temper, like whatsoever. I mean, I would just pretty much get angry. You know, the littlest things, everything would just kind of tick me off. But, you know, I've I've definitely learned to, you know, control that sort of thing. And, you know, it's made me a better person because of it. Well, let's see. I'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family, with my mother. Maybe it's I can't remember off the top of my head. But, you know, it's it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it. But, you know, eventually we make up and I apologize for it because, you know, I accept that, you know, I'm wrong in certain circumstances. You know. What's something you feel guilty about? Something that I feel guilty about? Probably, you know, not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past. You know, I mean, that is the past and, you know, I don't like to dwell on that sort of thing. But I think that's one thing that I've tried to work on. But it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing. Just being just being nice. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I ever had to make. Pretty recent. Kind of tough because I actually have a buddy. He was in the Air Force and he recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So that was really tough. And it's hard for me to talk to him because, you know, he's not really all there anymore like he used to be. So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that. But at the same time, I don't know his tendencies. He could be a little, you know, crazy. So probably like, you know, some sort of like traumatic stress disorder. Maybe when he was in the military. So I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's pretty tough, you know, because we go way back. I've been best friends with him since I was probably about five, six years old. So it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to deal with. But, you know, I try to, I don't, you know, try to keep in the back of my mind. But, you know, it's always there. I don't ever forget. So, yeah. Okay. How are your best friends friends with you? My best friend? Well, he'd probably say that, you know, I'm a pretty down to earth guy. Usually pretty honest. Sometimes brutally honest. But, you know, I try to work on that too. He'd probably say that I'm pretty funny. I like to hang out, you know, just kind of do things here and there, you know. Just normal activities like any other person. You know, go to the beach, hang out, watch movies, you know, grab a few beers, that sort of deal. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? You know, it varies. Sometimes it's easier than others. You know, if I'm really tired, you know, I'll probably have a very good sleep. I haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days because, you know, my house, there's workers on the roof. So you're putting in the new roofing. So that's kind of tough. So that always wakes me up early in the morning. So sometimes a little bit crabby. But for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep. Okay. How have you been doing lately? Lately, eh, I've been feeling pretty good, you know, because, you know, things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago for, you know, my field of journalism. So that's good. About to graduate in two months. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money. That's, you know, that's good. And, yeah, things are just going pretty well right now. I can't complain. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it's not bad. You know, like I said, it could always be worse, right? But, you know, I'm enjoying life. So that's the best part. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Did it feel down? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy? Man. You know, it was probably going back to my buddy when, you know, he was still, still had his sanity, I guess you could say. You know, he came back to visit from the Air Force. He had some leave. So, you know, we were just hanging out, you know, just kicking back, having a few beers and just talking about life. So that was nice. But I missed that, you know, so. How did you feel when that happened? I felt great, you know, because there's nothing like having a best friend. You can have conversation, you know, 24-7 about anything. You can tell anything to him in confidence. You can tell me anything in confidence. Like, it's hard to find, you know, especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now. So, yeah. Is there anything you regret? Yeah, there's probably one or two things that I regret. Well, I mean, I got a DUI about three or four years ago. Actually, it was four years ago. So that's something that I definitely regret because, you know, I look back on it and, you know, things might have been different. But at the same time, you have to accept, you know, the actions, you know, circumstances that took place. So, you know, I'm manned up and, you know, I guess I think I'm better off for it. But at the same time, you know, it's always going to be in the back of my mind, like I said. It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I usually keep it pretty generic. I tend to hang out with my friends. Either, you know, we hang out in the day, you know, do certain things like, you know, maybe grab a few beers, you know, just have casual conversation, maybe play games, watch movies, you know, just the standard stuff that people do. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Some things that I wish I could change? Probably just, you know, being nicer, like I said before. Maybe not being as lazy, have more determination. I mean, I have quite a bit of determination. I know what I want to do with my life. But I know there are times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical. So I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Well, you know, it's tough to think back. But I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is, you know, I would say probably like when I was, you know, kind of getting angry at certain people, maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have. I was trying to give more constructive criticism, but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things. And they were out of character, so. Okay. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities, I would say that I'm definitely hardworking. I'm determined. I'm very caring now, more than I used to be. Very honest. And, you know, I just, I love to talk to people. Like I like making new relationships. I like making people laugh. That's good. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something that I did recently that I really enjoyed? You know, it was probably over at my internship. I was just, you know, I wrote a story or two. And it just felt good, you know, to get those stories done. And eventually they're going to go into the paper. So I feel accomplished about that. You know, it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there. You know, it's right in your face. And you can tell yourself, you know, like I did that. So it makes me feel good. Yep. What was it about? You know, just let's see. A few different stories. Just usually things about, well, the paper's in Long Beach. So it's usually about, you know, stories or events that are taking place in Long Beach. So, yeah. What are you most proud of in life? I would say that I'm most proud of, you know, graduating high school, about to graduate college. Hopefully, you know, obviously I'm going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job, you know, in the near future. I think that's one thing that I'm most proud of. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay. I'm going to move back to the computer. I'm going to shut all the recording down. And just going to have you fill out a quick post survey about your experience. So we really value your feedback. So we really ask that you take care of your answers.",
         "Okay. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions and I'll answer them. And please feel free to comment below and your answers are really comforting. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling okay. I'm a little bit tired but for the most part, I'm feeling pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills, which is out in the San Fernando Valley. I was born there. And then I moved to Lomita, which is in Los Angeles County, about probably around 1993. So, I'm 23 now. So, it's about what, 19 years or so I've been living there. What are some things you really like about LA? Some things that I really like, I would have to say, you know, the beach. You know, not so much the traffic. I don't really care for that. But definitely, you know, just kind of like the nightlife. You know, just people in general. I like conversing with others. So, yeah. I see what you mean. Right. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, actually I do. I mean, I can't see your shoes. But yeah, actually I do travel a lot. I've been to places like Hawaii. I've been to the Caribbean. I've been to, let's see, you know, just different places like Arizona. I've been to Oregon, Washington. Pretty much all over, I would say. But usually mainly like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico as well. What do you enjoy about traveling? I think it's just the experience, you know. Like you can kind of experience the culture, different people, you know. Just the whole background, the scenery. It's just, you know, it's something new to experience, I would say. Something that, you know, people haven't seen before. And what's your favorite part of your trips? Well, let's see. I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago. That was back in December. It was around Christmas time, New Year's. So that was pretty fun. We went to a couple different islands. We went to, let's see, I think it was Kauai. We went to Oahu, Maui, you know, places like that. Nice. What's one thing you're most memorable seeing? You know, I would have to say that, you know, probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean. You know, just like I said before, the whole experience factor. Just seeing, you know, new, different things. Things that are unique. What did you study at school? I actually study journalism right now. In my final semester. So I'm about to graduate. A couple months. That's great. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, it's kind of funny because, you know, I started off at a, you know, a two-year community college. And so, you know, I was going into like business management. Something to do with, you know, I think basically accounting. But, you know, I kind of figured that wasn't for me. So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't, I mean, you know, I'd probably still be sitting at a desk. But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. I would almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. So. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. You know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back. Other times I kind of, it's not so much like I go into my shell, but, you know, at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't, I've never met them before.

         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression, and I don't feel down. Lately, I've been feeling pretty good, especially with my new internship in journalism and graduating soon; things are looking up, and I'm enjoying life. I do feel some guilt about not always being as nice to others in the past, and I regret getting a DUI a few years ago, though I try not to dwell on those things. It's been really tough dealing with my best friend's recent diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia; it's hard to talk to him now, and I miss our conversations, which is something that's always in the back of my mind. My sleep has been a bit affected in the last few days, but that's due to roof workers at my house waking me up early. Generally, I usually get a pretty good sleep.",

Um That's where i'm from Um Well There's a lot more that I don't like but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up. Uh that the idea of Certain, you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent, you know topic very thought upon and I feel that los angeles's deep culture is um, why I stay here and pursue my art because There's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand Yeah Um Well the human mentality here is uh Is very hectic very chaotic, you know a lot due to The vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that we're on A grind, you know this Yeah, it's a very hectic. Um atmosphere human atmosphere that Is not very conducive for a supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing Yeah I'm not much of a world explorer Well, I can't see your shoes But um, I love to travel I do love hiking I do love Surfing swimming biking riding taking rides. Uh, I do love to travel.

I was working at a hot spring resort And I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry Um not hard you don't you don't even think about Difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't Um I guess uh Kind of what I described about this city. I just wanted to uh, get out of here and Kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal.

         "I've been feeling kind of like I'm cruising on a 'nice gray line,' which I actually find stable and comfortable, even if some people might not like it. I believe that everyone experiences depression, happiness, and anger, just on different days and in different ways, and I haven't been diagnosed by a medical professional.\n\nThe hectic and chaotic atmosphere of Los Angeles, with its car culture and constant 'grind,' isn't very supportive and can be overwhelming. To escape this, I love traveling to see the world as it truly is, away from the 'man-made image' of the city. I recently found a sense of 'relative sanity' in Los Banos, where I could breathe, hike, farm, and do carpentry without digital distractions, which was truly enjoyable.\n\nWhen my thoughts get overwhelming, it takes me a long time to remember to breathe and settle down for sleep. To relax and help with this, I make chamomile tea, practice breathing exercises, go through my mantras, and do 'pre-dream therapy work.' Sometimes, if I'm lucky, a nice indica helps me get drowsy. I recently felt guilty about how I handled leaving an apartment and a relationship, wishing I had been more thoughtful about it. My family is important to me; I'm very close with my mom and sister, and while communication with my dad needs work, I connect with him through his art.",

A couple years ago I went to Catalina Islands for my birthday. I took a boat there. I'll be on an airplane and leaving Indiana for good. Okay. Sleeping. Being a filmmaker. Because it's one job I haven't had yet. Not too hard. Shy. Because of my past. I just have trouble making new friends and just trusting people. Okay. Watch TV or go to the movies. I don't have a temper. When I was 16, my stepfather. I was just having nightmares about my childhood. About involving my biological father. How do you cope with that? When was the last time that happened? How did you feel in that moment? Okay. Pushing people away. I guess try to trust them a little bit more. I guess try to live them in my life a little bit more. Would that be easy? That would be the first half of my life. I guess it would be easy to start a new life if I can't remember my old one. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. All my decisions are not that hard. I just try to avoid stress and everything. So I don't really have hard decisions. Tell me about a situation you wish you would handle differently. Where every time I push someone away, I wish I handle all those situations differently. Can you example that? Whenever someone gets too involved in my life, I always say or do something to make them want to stay away from me. Like what? Depending on the type of person they are. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I really don't have a relationship with any of my family. I know I have a sister someplace in Vegas, a half of a brother in Indiana, my step-father is in Arizona. Other than that, I have no relationship with any of them. Can you tell me about that? We really don't talk, so it's kind of hard to talk about it. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Agri-Casey. I'd love to hear all about it. Well, he died way before I was born, and I only know him from books and documentaries. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Really not that easy. It's usually taking me a few hours to finally get to sleep once I lay down on my bed. Tell me about that. What are you like when you don't sleep well? How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been feeling a little bit upset, and my life was different. Can you tell me about that? Well, I wish I had friends and loved ones and all that, and I wish I had an actual relationship and everything, but I don't. Have you ever studied to use an abbreviated or a constant? Well, lately I removed a bunch of things on my life, stressful things like bills and whatnot, and just tried to make sure there's the least amount of stress in my life by removing these different things in my life and trying to incorporate new things. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? How long ago were you diagnosed? What got you to sleep out? Do you still get the therapy now? How is seeing a therapist affecting you? Well, basically I just got rid of them on my life because I didn't feel like they were really listening to me or anything. So I just didn't feel too much beneficial help from them, so I've been looking for alternative means. Like what? Well, basically like music and forcing myself to go to different social related events. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. What were your symptoms? Depress. Basically just depressed, keeping myself locked in, not talking to anyone. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I guess a few days ago. Okay. Well, basically I feel that the best way to keep people in my life is having fake people in my life by playing online multiplayer games with avatars and usernames and everything. I just have somewhat fun going to these virtual worlds with these avatars and talking to people that way so they don't know who I really am. They don't even know my real name. Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Okay. Well, my ideal weekend. Let me see. If I'm not working that weekend, I will get up, maybe go to like Starbucks or McDonald's, get online while eating or drinking something, maybe play an online multiplayer game for a little while. And then later on in the day, maybe go to a movie, wherever it's playing, then go someplace else, relax, watch some TV, and maybe put on a DVD movie. Or I might spend a whole day driving to someplace I haven't been before or it's been a long time since I've been. And try to spend the day in that area. And yeah, so that's the weekend. My life. I just regret how my life turned out. I was, I wish I had a more normal stable life. Let me see. 10, 20 years ago, I was this basically. I'll just tell myself to keep a journal or to basically tell myself how my life turned out now. So that way, hopefully the other me will make different choices. My mind. Well, I was, I wish I was a bit healthier. I wish I looked a little bit better. I wish my eyesight was a lot better. And I wish I had a bunch of people in my life that I could call friends. I'm a freaking genius. I could. Everything that I'm good at, I learned self taught. So basically I can't get a career in that type of stuff unless I go to school for it. But it's hard to it's basically easier if I teach myself, then I take some type of a class to do it. And everything because yeah, yeah, just basically the fact I'm a freaking genius. Okay. Thank you.

What do you enjoy about traveling? I love to go out on the trips. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? How are you at controlling your hunger? That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? That sucks. Tell me about your relationship with your family. That's good. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Uh-huh. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. That I wish I would have handled differently. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. What made you decide to do that? Why don't we talk about that later? How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? What are you like when you don't sleep well? Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Have you ever spent any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Have you ever been diagnosed with dyslexia? Have you been diagnosed with depression? Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Can you tell me about that? Aw. That's great. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Weekend? Well, I like to watch English League soccer. And sometimes if I'm in Philly, I spend time with my family on weekends. If not, I'll just hang out with my brother or Sundays at ref soccer. Just really laid back and chill. Nice. Thank you. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. How would your best friend describe you? Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you lately? Can you tell me about that? He's a man of few words. He's very calm, slow to anger. Very warm, very loving man. Responsible. He's a gentleman. He has a great sense of style. He's a great cook. Uh huh. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of? It was a series regular on the wire a couple years ago in the last season. Awesome. Thank you. Okay. I think I've asked everything I knew to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Bye. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.",

         " So now she's going to chat with you for a bit. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty well. I have some stressful circumstances going on, but right now I'm engaged. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Minnesota. Really? Mm-hmm. When did you move to LA? 31 years ago. That's a long time. Half my life. How often do you go back to your hometown? Frequently I've been back there quite a bit, but over the years not that often. How does it compare to LA? Well, it's a whole different experience. I go back there to see my family and old friends. LA is home. It's nice to return here. That's good. Why did you move to LA? To be an actor. Are you still doing that? I'm just actually getting around to it. I was in another business for 25 years, and now finally I can't put it off anymore. What made you decide to do that? The economy. It's easy to find work in show business, it seems, as it is any of the other jobs I've done in the past. Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? A whole variety of things, but mostly having to do with theater. What's your dream job? To be a successful actor would be nice. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. With elements of shyness. I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Well, I read and I cook. That's about it. I'm a big radio listener to talk radio, national public radio, and more not crazy stuff. Sensible listening, nice content, interesting human interest. Like what? Oh, well I'm also a comedian, and so I like to listen to radio shows that have comedy. How are you at controlling yourself? I'm pretty good. I mean, I'm not perfect. I can get very upset. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Oh, probably with my wife about my methods of job hunting and like that. How hard is that? It's difficult. We're very different and have very different MOs. For me to do things my way is not always easy. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. Well, just the other night I was performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to introduce myself to a very famous person and I didn't do it. Why? I'm not sure. I guess I didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him. I miss him. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I can't think of one. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I've been married for 24 years in July, which is a couple of months. My wife and I have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years. We have a very high achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school this spring. She's just gotten accepted at a college that she wants to go to with a very nice scholarship. That's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Yeah. Well, my daughter's been very low maintenance for me, perhaps more so for my wife, but she's always been an excellent child. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Well, we're more similar, I think, than different. I'm much more aware of what's happening in the world and much more informed than my parents were. But in terms of child rearing, I think we've all been kind of hands-off. My wife has been more hands-on. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Well, the financial responsibility. I think it's wanting to make sure that your child has everything that her peers have and not wanting her to not have the same as her friends. And she has very wealthy friends. I am not a gifted moneymaker. It's a struggle, but we keep up. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. That sort of put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that were kind of dictated by my upbringing. Like what? Oh, just instead of working for somebody else, being able to start a business and be in business for yourself and to not be dependent on just one source of income. Okay. Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Oh. Meeting one particular woman when I first got out here. Tell me about that. She left me less than healthy physically. I self-medicate to go to sleep, which I probably don't have to do, but about half the nights I wake up much earlier than I would like to. Why? Oh, mostly to have to go to the bathroom. Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Well, I cope pretty well. I guess I'm just not quite as functional as I'd like to be. There are a couple of nights a week when I work until two o'clock in the morning and don't get to bed until three. Normally I need seven hours if I only get five or six and I'm sluggish. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Very anxious. Can you tell me about that? Well, I have big bills to pay and not a lot of income coming in. That sounds really high. Yeah, it's because I don't like to fall behind. I feel like I'm worried about losing ground and the stakes are high. It's an uncomfortable position. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I am a classic depressive. Yeah, I guess I have. I do see a therapist. Though the therapist I'm seeing now is not trying to prescribe drugs or medications. Previous ones have. How long ago were you diagnosed? Probably six years ago. What got you into seeing help? Well, my wife kind of pushed me into it. She thought it was a way of, I think, getting help finding work. It's not. It's just I enjoyed having someone to talk to. Not really. What were your symptoms? I was just having a lot of trouble with the struggle. Displeasure with my life. Do you still have a therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Their what? Do you feel like therapy is useful? I don't understand that word. Have you noticed anything on your head? Well, I... It's something I look forward to because I feel like I'm talking to someone who understands me. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I can't. I don't know. Each little acting gig that I get makes me happy, but just mildly happy. They usually turn out to be disappointing experiences. I'm never over-excited with happiness. Tell me about something you've been doing that you really enjoy. Yesterday I made a dessert to celebrate my daughter's scholarship. It was delicious and we really enjoyed that. That's so good to hear. Is there anything you're about? No. Except meeting that one woman. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Probably try a little harder. I had started this business around that time. It was difficult, but we were successful at it. I guess I could have gotten it rolling even more so that it wouldn't be so dead today. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. What are you most proud of about your mother? I'm going for the big apple. I hope to be successful there too. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.",

         "I've been diagnosed as a classic depressive, probably about six years ago. My wife really encouraged me to seek help, initially thinking it would assist with finding work, but for me, it's more about having someone to talk to who understands me.\n\nLately, I've been feeling very anxious, primarily because of significant financial pressures – I have big bills and not a lot of income. This makes me constantly worried about losing ground, and it's a very uncomfortable position to be in.\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed, my main symptoms were a lot of trouble with the struggle and a general displeasure with my life. This feeling persists; I can't really recall the last time I felt truly happy. Even small acting gigs, while mildly enjoyable, usually end up being disappointing, and I'm never over-excited with happiness.\n\nMy sleep is often affected; I self-medicate to fall asleep, and about half the nights I wake up much earlier than I'd like. If I don't get my usual seven hours, I feel sluggish and not as functional as I'd like to be, though I generally cope pretty well.\n\nBeyond the financial strain, I've also been sleeping separately from my wife for about three years. In terms of coping, I find listening to talk radio, reading, and cooking helpful for relaxation, and therapy is something I look forward to because it provides a space to talk to someone who gets it.",

About once a year. That's good. How does it compare to LA? More boring. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Not easy. Can you tell me about that? It's hard when you don't have enough money to get your own place, so I have to live with roommates. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. The scenery. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. It's too expensive to have your own place by your own. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I want to. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different places, different cultures, the buildings, the food and stuff. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I drove from Florida over here. I drove to the South. I went to Alabama. People are nicer in Louisiana. People are really nice. Then Mississippi, then Texas, then Arizona, then California. I got to see the country a little bit. Awesome. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess traveling through the country. I went to Louisiana. People are really nice in a small town called Jennings. People are always happy and fun. That's great. What did you study at school? I just went to high school. That was the basic stuff. What's your dream job? I don't know. My dream job? I'm an interior designer to the stars. Really? Yep. Why? Because they have enough money to get the furniture and I get to keep the free furniture too. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Upgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV, funny TV shows. Like what? Sometimes Big Bang Theory or sometimes a funny movie on TV. Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Where I used to live about two weeks ago, I had to move out. I moved in there and he told me that he didn't have any marijuana or marijuana plants because he didn't want to be around. He had that so I had to move out because he had a self-in-living room. Yeah, it does. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and him would handle differently. I don't know. Good question. Probably... Probably, I don't know, probably with an ex-boyfriend. We broke up. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, it's in the past. I'm over him. He was a jerk anyway. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision? Leaving home? Tell me about that. Well, I could try a better life out here in California but I miss home. Yeah, I'm sorry. Isn't it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yep. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? My roommates don't have the TV on now. It's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. I'm lazier during the day. Uh-huh. How have you been feeling lately? Frustrated. Why? I'm poor. I don't want to be. I see. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just more sad. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Wow. Um... It's been a while. It's been like, god, more over two years. Can you tell me about that? Um, I didn't have any money problems. I was doing fine. Um, yep. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? Oh, what did I do? Um, I was with my cats at home here in California and they're playing outside. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend would be nice. Um, at the beach eating at a nice restaurant. Is there anything you regret? No. Not. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't spend so much money. You'll need it in the future. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Save money. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, my bank account. How would your best friend describe you? Um, it's a nice person. You were very young, weren't you? And what? What? What are you most proud of in your life? Um, um, I'm gonna push that out now. Um, I persevere. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, I'd rather not. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh, me a few years ago. I was more like a mentor and um, taught me some things. Like what? Never complain. Be thankful for everything you have. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Um, my eyes? People say I have pretty eyes. Um, like a dress up. What are some things you like to do for fun? For fun? I like to try surfing. Go shopping. Maybe go to art galleries. That's good. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye! Bye!

Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just more sad. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Wow. Um... It's been a while. It's been like, god, more over two years. Can you tell me about that? Um, I didn't have any money problems. I was doing fine. Um, yep. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? Oh, what did I do? Um, I was with my cats at home here in California and they're playing outside. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend would be nice. Um, at the beach eating at a nice restaurant. Is there anything you regret? No. Not. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't spend so much money. You'll need it in the future. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Save money. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, my bank account. How would your best friend describe you? Um, it's a nice person. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I'm gonna push that out now. Um, I persevere. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, I'd rather not. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh, me a few years ago. I was more like a mentor and um, taught me some things. Like what? Never complain. Be thankful for everything you have. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Um, my eyes? People say I have pretty eyes. Um, like a dress up. What are some things you like to do for fun? For fun? I like to try surfing. Go shopping. Maybe go to art galleries. That's good. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye! Bye! Press the button? Yes. Hi. Okay.",
         "I've been feeling kind of down lately, frustrated, and just more sad. A big part of why I feel this way is that I don't have a boyfriend and I don't have money. I'm poor, and I don't want to be. It's been over two years since I felt really happy; back then, I didn't have any money problems and was doing fine. Leaving home was a hard decision, and I miss it.\n\nMy sleep is pretty good now that my roommates don't have the TV on, but when I don't sleep well, I'm tired and lazier during the day. My financial situation really impacts my life. It's hard when you don't have enough money to get your own place, so I have to live with roommates. It's too expensive here. I tried to find work in LA. I even had to move out of a place recently because my roommate had marijuana plants.\n\nTo relax, I watch funny TV shows like Big Bang Theory or funny movies. Sometimes, when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. I'm proud that I persevere. I also try to remember advice from a mentor I had a few years ago, who taught me to never complain and be thankful for everything I have. I've been trying to save money, and I'd tell my younger self not to spend so much because I'll need it in the future.\n\nMy current feelings of sadness and frustration have been going on for over two years. The lack of money and not having a boyfriend are big reasons for how I feel. I haven't been diagnosed with depression.",

         " Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. That's good. Where are you from originally? California. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. I like the people. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. That's primarily it. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Sociology. Really? Yep. How did you decide to do that? It's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects. Are you still working on that? No. What's your dream job? To be a writer. Can you tell me about that? I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in. Like what? Like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. What do you think of today's kids? I think they have it pretty easy. They don't know how easy they have it. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not really. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing like watch TV. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long. Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. Why? Because they basically sort of raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much. I understand. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and them would different me. I can't really think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about me that or something that you wish you could erase from the memory. I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not really super easy. I sort of, I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh, last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends describing you? Probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh, no. I don't think. There's not, I don't think, I think regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't try to, don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, sometimes, sometimes I can be kind of lazy. Uh, I'd like to have more of a, um, like sort of a better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh, just sort of putting off stuff until, you know, right when it's due or after it's due, things like that. Um, procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh, sometimes for the things that I write, uh, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I guess I'm most proud of the fact that, uh, I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, just hanging out with my friends, uh, sort of people watching, watching a movie that's good, um, listening to music. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye.",

         "I sometimes feel guilty about not talking to my grandparents as much as I should. Getting a good night's sleep isn't super easy for me; I often go to bed too late, which leaves me feeling foggy, distracted, and having trouble concentrating the next day.

What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Just so many, sometimes too many people. But apart from that, I'm generally happy here. Okay. What did you study at school? Photography and language studies. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I love photography. I was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well. So I wanted to continue to learn more about it. And with languages, I come from a mixed background. So I wanted to learn languages of my ethnic background. How hard is that? It wasn't hard. It was a passion. So I enjoyed it. Are you still working on that? I'm not. What's your dream job? To do photography full time. And also to do some of the things that I'm passionate about more creatively. More creative things. Like what? I have an idea. I'd like to make a robe line. Women's robes and things like that. Awesome. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I have. I love travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different cultures, different countries, meeting new people. All of that. And the language. I lived in Greece for over a year. I taught English there. And moved around to different parts of Greece. And really had a great time. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think just having my group of friends that I met there. And going through the experience with them. I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to Elefonisos in a car with everybody. And having just a fantastic time. That sounds like a great situation. Yes it was. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm shy to begin with. And as I get to know people that I'm much more outgoing. What do you study at school? Photography and language studies. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I just stay at home. Maybe watch a movie. Rest in bed. Watching a movie in bed. That's probably one of the things I like to do to relax. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I think very good. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? It was probably with my boyfriend. Regarding money issues. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now. Can you tell me about that? I'm having some struggles in my career right now. Financially, it's becoming very difficult. I'm sorry. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it has been difficult. But I've been working very hard to remedy that. That's great. Can you give me an example of that? While I'm here, I'm doing this focus study. I'm doing many things to generate more money, working harder, but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my career. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Probably being raped. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Sometimes. Are they triggered by something? Not that I'm aware of. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling stressed. I've been feeling stressed and worried. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't seem to have any problem with it. I seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Grumpy and lethargic in the morning. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Hmm. A situation I wish I would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was probably deciding to not have a child. Can you tell me about that? Well, I was pregnant and wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy. That was also due to financial burden. The father who I was involved with did not want the child. So I made that very, very difficult decision. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Really, really happy. I know. When I went to Cancun on a holiday over the New Year period. New Year holiday. How did you feel in that moment? I felt absolutely fantastic. I felt happy. I felt relaxed. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world temporarily. Free. That's great. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive. Definitely more assertive. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I would say I'm a wonderful, wonderful friend. I love somebody. I love them very deeply. Friends, family, boyfriend. I think that's good. I'm very loyal as a friend. I'm honest. I care about people. I'm fun to be with. I think those are some of my best qualities. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, with my father, is not so great. My parents were divorced when I was young. He's sort of been in and out of my life forever. Mostly out. It's not fantastic, but it's something that I'm used to. It's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then I lost him. It's still not the best situation. I still wish that could be remedied somehow. There's good and bad relationships in my family. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. I love someone that's been there for me since I was very, very young. It's always been just incredible. I love her so much. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun. So I don't have to work so hard now. Is there anything you regret? I regret exactly that. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on. Because now it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them. Making them happy. That was probably one of the best times in the last few weeks. Tell me about your kids. They're great kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No, I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren. There are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. We're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot. But it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them or overpunish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child. It was really difficult so I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to travel the world and live in other places, many, many other places around the country and around the world. The fact that I learned several languages. The fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything on YouTube.

What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun. So I don't have to work so hard now. Is there anything you regret? I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on. Because now it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them. Making them happy. That was probably one of the best times in the last few weeks. Tell me about your kids. They're great kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No, I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren. There are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. We're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot. But it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them or overpunish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child. It was really difficult so I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to travel the world and live in other places, many other places around the country and around the world. The fact that I learned several languages. The fact that I've been able to maintain really long relationships with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Wow.",
         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression, but lately, I've been feeling stressed and worried. Sometimes I have disturbing thoughts, though I'm not aware of what triggers them. I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now, as I'm having significant struggles in my career financially. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier, as it's much harder now. I'm working very hard to remedy this, doing many things to generate more money and looking for other ways to earn income outside my career.\n\nMy past includes a traumatic experience of being raped. I also made the very difficult decision to not have a child, which was due to financial burden and the father not wanting the child. My relationship with my father is not great; he's mostly been in and out of my life, and I still wish that could be remedied somehow.\n\nI usually get a good night's sleep almost every night, but if I don't sleep well, I'm grumpy and lethargic in the morning. To relax, I typically stay home and watch a movie in bed. I tend to be shy initially, but I become much more outgoing as I get to know people. Being a parent, especially to my stepchildren, is challenging, and I sometimes struggle with how much to get involved. I wish I could be a little bit stronger and definitely more assertive.\n\nDespite these challenges, I have lots of friends and family here, and I consider myself a wonderful, loyal, honest, and caring friend who loves deeply. I recently felt absolutely fantastic, happy, relaxed, and free on a holiday in Cancun, like I didn't have a care in the world temporarily. Spending time with my stepchildren at the pier and making them happy was also one of the best times in the last few weeks.",

         " Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Virginia. Really? When did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more diversity. How often do you go back to your hometown? Once a year maybe. How does it compare to LA? It's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there. Why did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer, warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and there's a lot more going on. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? For me it was really easy because I wanted something very different and I wanted something different. What are some things you really like about LA? I like all the things to do, like the museums, I like the beaches and the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? People that don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back and bad drivers. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I would like to. I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to that much. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places. My wife and I like to see wildlife and hike and monuments and just seeing different areas. Cool. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. We went to Central California. We'd like to be able to go more internationally but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally. We went to Hearst Castle to see the elephant seals and things like that. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary. We did the tram and a nice hotel on the Jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I guess somewhere in between. What did you study at school? English and film. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, I was told I needed to go to college and I hadn't quite decided what to do yet so I just picked something I liked to do for the time being. Are you happy you did that? Well, I wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to. I might have done something different like physical therapy. Are you still working on that? No, I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before. Wow. What made you decide to do that? I needed to not starve and it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and it ended up being kind of fun. That's good. What's your dream job? Dream job is to have money and not have to work for it. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Overall, pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I don't remember what it was about but it probably would have been a few weeks ago with my wife. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled, I always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone's not listening it drives me crazy. Can you give me an example of that? If I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening, it makes me really upset. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I don't know. I spend a lot of time on them but I don't know what the hardest one is because if I decide to go with something it's usually for a good reason. Uh huh. What's something you feel guilty about? Well, I guess I feel guilty about moving to California and that I left my family in Virginia. I mean, I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there, you know, I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them. How hard is that? Well, I mean, I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a good relationship with my wife, with my in-laws, with my mom, dad and sister. There's no problems. Everyone gets along well. How close are you to your family? Very close. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Um, I mean anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Depends on how much exercise I have. I get a lot of exercise. It's pretty easy. If I don't, it's not. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, kind of like right now just a little bit slowing out of it but not really too different otherwise. Uh huh. How have you been feeling lately? Um, just kind of run down because my mother-in-law is dying and we just spent like three days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep. I'm sorry. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Just slower and more tired and a little more out of it. That's all. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, usually just when I'm having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's pretty easy for me. Just getting outside and hiking or exercising is not hard for me. How would your best friend describe you? I'm not sure. Maybe um, maybe like eccentric but in a good way. Hopefully. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be careful with your job to make sure you can keep from being injured and to, I don't know, just your normal kind of older kind of wisdom. Can you tell me about that? Not much to say really. Everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back in the shape like I used to be. That's the biggest thing right now. Can you tell me more about that? Um, not much to say. Just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it because it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things. That's all. Like what? Well like I used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit because it hurts too much. That sucks. Tell me how you spend your entire weekend. Um, probably like during the day going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then at night you know we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I'm most proud of um, proud of moving here. I mean I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something I regretted but I came out and I've always thought that was a good decision. That's good. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. My parents, my grandparents, my wife, most people in my life have been. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye bye. Okay. I'm going to switch to the other computer where we're going to have you do a quick post-script about your experience.",

         "Lately, I've been feeling pretty run down, mostly because my mother-in-law is dying, and we've been spending a lot of time in the hospital, which means I haven't had much time to sleep. This lack of sleep makes me feel slower, more tired, and a little more out of it, kind of like I am right now. Beyond that, I carry some guilt about moving to California and leaving my family in Virginia. Even though I know I shouldn't, they always seem to miss me, and it feels a bit like I abandoned them, which is a little hard to deal with. My back injury also holds me back from being as active as I used to be, like with gymnastics, which can be frustrating. When I don't get enough exercise, it's harder for me to sleep well. Despite these feelings, I try to stay active, like going on hikes or to the park with my wife, taking pictures, and enjoying wildlife, and at night, we'll watch a movie or go dancing.",

What are you most proud of in your life? I'm most proud that I've always been different. That despite how many people have told me that I'm really weird or I'm odd or I think weird things, I've always maintained my original mentality. I think I've lost everything in me. Thank you for being with me. Goodbye. Bye!",

         "I've been feeling really low for about six months now. It started gradually after a period of high stress at work and a personal loss. My mood is a deep sadness, an emptiness, and I've lost interest in almost everything I used to enjoy. There's a constant feeling of guilt, especially about not being productive or feeling like a burden. Hopelessness often sets in, making it feel like there's no way out, and sometimes I just feel numb or overwhelmingly exhausted. I've also noticed I'm more irritable, snapping at people easily.\n\nDaily life is a huge struggle. I have trouble sleeping, sometimes with insomnia, other times I sleep too much. My appetite has changed, either not eating much or sometimes overeating. I've been isolating myself, avoiding friends and family because I don't have the energy to socialize, and it's hard to pretend I'm okay. Motivation is non-existent; it's incredibly hard to get out of bed, and basic tasks like showering or getting dressed feel overwhelming. My work performance has suffered significantly, with missed deadlines and calling in sick because I can't focus.\n\nPhysically, I'm constantly fatigued and lack energy, and I've experienced physical aches like headaches and stomach issues. My concentration is poor, and I often feel like I have brain fog. My main coping strategy is just trying to get through each day, sometimes just lying in bed or trying to distract myself with TV, though it doesn't really help. I've started seeing a therapist a couple of months ago, and my partner and family have been very supportive, trying to help me, but it's still incredibly difficult.",

All my family's here, friends, a mixture of people, and a lot of things to do. Okay. What did you study at school? Early childhood education. Nice. Are you still working in that? No, not right now, but I would love to get back into it. Why? Love working with kids, seeing them smile. Tell me more about that. I guess it goes back to when I was a kid. I liked being happy and playful, so I guess it just transferred to my adult life. What's your dream job? Working with kids as a school teacher, or in that capacity. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is, but if it's a passion of yours, it'll always be fun. That's great. How close are you to your family? Very close. Sometimes too close. Can you give me an example of that? I have four sisters and one brother. On my mom's side, and on my dad's, I have six brothers and four sisters. We are intertwined together, so that's why I say we're too close sometimes. I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself an engineer? No. Why? I have a lot of friends that I interact with, and we're always doing different things, so that's why I say I'm not. Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? Curse. Just let it out. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? A couple days ago. My nephew didn't call me back. How did you feel in that moment? Kind of mad, because I had set aside some time to spend with him, and he just blew it off and then called me back. Yeah. That sucks. Yeah, I know. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm okay. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When my mother passed. I'm sorry. Tell me more about that. It's been about five years now to the day. It's getting better. Time makes it easier. That's good. Do you feel down? A lot, because there's a lot of things that make me think about her on a daily basis. Like what? Anything. Driving by a particular restaurant that she likes, watching different TV shows. Just anything that could trigger a memory of my mom. Yeah. When was the last time that happened? Yesterday. How do you cope with them? I think about the good times. Don't stay in that place too long. Just go ahead and think about it and move on. Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not officially, but I think I might be depressed. Tell me more about that. Well, since my mom passed, it's been kind of rough. The job situation is not stable here in California, so that has a lot to do with it as well. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is. Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Not really. I've been sort of just to myself, reserved. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Not really. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. What are you like when you do sleep well? Grumpy, irritable, fidgety, big ball of nerves. Do you travel a lot? What do you mean? Whatever comes to your mind. I guess so, yeah. I like to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting new people, different locations, scenery, different opportunities to try something new in a new location. Awesome. I'd love to hear about your trips. I just came back from Memphis about three weeks ago. Going to see family and friends. It was pretty nice. Got a chance to see something new. Change the scenery. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Wow. Stick to the plan and don't veer off to the left or right. Just go straight ahead. What made you decide to do that? Just different circumstances in life that gradually pushed me towards the left and the right. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Every day. Is there anything you regret? A few relationships, not staying in school, missing out on great opportunities with employers. How would your best friend describe you? Funny, loyal, spontaneous, life of the party. How do you know them? Grew up together in the same community, went to school together, high school friends. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Big sister Michelle, my friend Troy. I mean there's others, but those two, no matter good or bad, they're always in my corner for me. Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. When was the last time you were really happy? Yesterday. Celebrated birthday. Ah. That's great. I'd love to hear all about it. It was just a little small, intimate setting. Cooked a meal, had family and friends over, listened to music, watched movies, talked about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one unit. So it was just a nice evening. Yeah. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye bye. Was the screen like that the whole time? While I was talking. It was? Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. That's very bizarre. I've never seen you do that before. Have to do it over? No.",

         "I feel down a lot because many things daily remind me of my mom, who passed away about five years ago.

So there we go. Perfect. And now we can get started. When you're finished, when she's done, we'll hit this so that I know that it's going to be okay. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? Okay. How about yourself? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? Here in California. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Oh, well, that is big and brought us a lot to do, a lot of job opportunities in other states. Pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here. Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Maybe the violence rate, the bad news, even though you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still have to watch it so you can look out to see what's going on on a daily basis. What did you study at school? Sociology. I have a two-year degree in liberal arts, but my major was sociology. Nice. Are you still working in that? No. I'm still working as a MTA bus operator. What's your dream job? Well, since METRO is study growing, my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week. So, because they look to promote within the company, so that's a good thing. It's a lot of opportunities at METRO where you can take classes and they'll pay for tuition and things of that nature. That sounds like a great situation. Thanks. How hard is that? Well, it's not actually hard. Right now, it's easy if you take advantage of it right now because they look to promote within, so since I'm already working there, that's a good thing. So, it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible. Do you consider yourself an introvert? What do you mean? I'm sorry. Let's come back to that later. Okay. What do you do to relax? Read, take a long walk, hot bath, meditate, just close my eyes sometimes. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty much good because see, by me being a bus operator, you run into circumstances and situations, you've got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time. How hard is that? Well, I look at it like it goes with experience. You do something on a continuous basis. Usually, somewhere down the line, you become good at it. I look at it like that. I've been driving for years and dealing with the public, so it's just how you handle circumstances. You treat people like you want to be treated. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. I'm pretty good at it now, maybe when I was younger. As you get older, you get wiser and you learn different things, and I'm still learning today. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I would say my family, my kids. Even though I've been having a lot of deaths around me, but that's part of the life experience. You're born here, but you've got to leave here one day. My kids will keep me sane, and I love them, and my family. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Setting good examples, because you're the first teacher. You want to set a positive good example for your kids, and I think that's a good thing, and it starts at home. Can you give me an example of that? By you being the first teacher, you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up. Whatever's been taught in the home, they look in and learn every day. Whether it's at home school, kids have a tendency to do things what they see. You try to keep it positive, teach them good morals and values, and how to get along with other people, regardless of race, and different things of that nature. How many of your kids? I have a four and a half year old son. I have a seven year old daughter, and I also have a 23 year old. I'm about to be, well, my daughter's pregnant with the boy. She has three little girls, so I have three grandkids, and one on the way, which is the boy this time. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? The hardest thing is, well right now, I'm a single parent, so that makes it hard alone itself. They can be expensive at times, and it depends on the person's situation, whether they have help or a job, things of that nature to help the situation better. But it's hard. I try to keep a job, keep food in the house, just maintain and support my kids the best way I can. What's one of your most memorable experiences? With my kids, or just period. Whatever comes to your mind? What's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree. So it's kind of like, yeah, even though I'm the baby of ten kids, and I always kept that in the back of my mind, even though everybody, well pretty much my whole family have a decent job, but I'm the one with a degree. So I kind of gave myself a pat on the back. That's the only thing I remember in graduating, and my family there to support me. That's so good to hear. Thank you. How did you feel in that moment? Happy that I accomplished something. Even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma. I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident. I never went back. I got distracted. I was working at the same time, but I was just like more so. I needed income than schooling at that time, because I was a young parent, because I had my daughter at 17, so I was like I needed the money to support her. But I never went back, but I feel like it's never too late. So I felt like I'd take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder, so that's why I'm starting my class next week. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Hmm. Well, the advice I would have gave myself, that I probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age, and that I probably wouldn't have stayed in school, not let the accident just distract me. I would have remained in school. I probably wouldn't have had kids early. I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something. I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person, just having knowledge and learning different things. Keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day. So I think that's a plus in anybody's shoes, just to better themselves through education, maybe to promote within your company, or whatever the case may be to help better your career. Yeah. Have you done anything to avoid it? I'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes, but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones. I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change, like myself, even though I'm going to school late, but still, I'm going. I want to better myself career-wise. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Yes. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? My oldest daughter. We had an argument because just the life she's living right now and the things that she's going through, and I had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation. We got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear the stuff that you're saying, even though it's true, or they just don't want to hear it. They may be going through something they don't want to hear, but we got into an argument about it, but that just happened. I just told her my- How close are you to them? I'm sorry? How close are you to them? Very close. Very close. The situation my daughter is in right now, she just needs to make some changes to better her life. She's kind of like stubborn in her own way. I was raised to listen to your mom. Your mom was not going to tell you nothing wrong. I've been telling her over the years different things. It's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite, and now she's regretting it. She's like, my mom told me this. Why am I doing the opposite? I guess she's got to bump her head a couple of times to get it. It's kind of like I didn't tell you, I didn't leave it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change. How hard is that? It's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. It seems like it's taking forever for her to change, but it's left up to the individual when they're ready. You know what I mean? Once a person gets tired of something, they make a change. It may not be when you want it to happen, but the ball is in her court. I only can do so much. I see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Oh, wow. I have my days. Since I have two little ones, I kind of like train them to go to bed at 8 o'clock because they've got to go to school. I think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kind of like gets you ready for the next day. How are you going to feel if you rest? What type of person are you going to be that day? I'm going to be that day because everybody has their days, whether they're good or bad, but that's just part of life. I feel like if you had a good night's rest, hopefully you'll have a good day. Do you feel that way often? Pretty much. I need my rest because I'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people. The job itself is very stressful, so I feel like if I'm rested it'll help me. What are you like when you don't sleep well? What am I like? Irritated, tired, lazy. I feel like I'll want to lay down and probably go to sleep and get the rest that I need. What do you do when you're annoyed? I never thought about that. Like I said, everybody has their moments, they do. I never thought about that. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? I don't really have a best friend, but a person that I deal with, that I used to work with, she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing, a go-getter, dependable, responsible. I'm a people person. I get along with others. I leave a good mark, whether I know you or not. If you were like you and I now, you'd probably say, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever, something like that. That's great. Thank you. When was the last time you felt really happy? Well, I try to stay happy. I'd rather be happy than sad. My kids keep me going, you know what I mean? Especially when I go to pick them up from school or maybe, hey mom, you know, that just kind of like make my day. Just them run up to me, you know, and be happy and excited. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're more than welcome. You have a good day. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. You're welcome. So I'm going to turn all this off and then we can just have a little closer look. Okay. That is so interesting. Mm-hmm.",

I try to keep a job, keep food in the house, just maintain and support my kids the best way I can.\nWhat's one of your most memorable experiences?\nWith my kids, or just period.\nWhatever comes to your mind?\nWhat's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree. So it's kind of like, yeah, even though I'm the baby of ten kids, and I always kept that in the back of my mind, even though everybody, well pretty much my whole family have a decent job, but I'm the one with a degree. So I kind of gave myself a pat on the back. That's the only thing I remember in graduating, and my family there to support me.\nThat's so good to hear. Thank you. How did you feel in that moment?\nHappy that I accomplished something. Even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma. I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident. I never went back. I got distracted. I was working at the same time, but I needed income than schooling at that time, because I was a young parent, because I had my daughter at 17, so I needed the money to support her. But I never went back, but I feel like it's never too late. So I felt like I'd take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder, so that's why I'm starting my class next week.\nThat sounds like a great situation. Thank you. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago?\nHmm. Well, the advice I would have gave myself, that I probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age, and that I probably wouldn't have stayed in school, not let the accident just distract me. I would have remained in school. I probably wouldn't have had kids early. I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something. I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person, just having knowledge and learning different things. Keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day. So I think that's a plus in anybody's shoes, just to better themselves through education, maybe to promote within your company, or whatever the case may be to help better your career. Yeah.\nHave you done anything to avoid it?\nI'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes, but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones. I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change, like myself, even though I'm going to school late, but still, I'm going. I want to better myself career-wise.\nThere are always trade-offs in life, aren't there?\nYes.\nWhen was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about?\nMy oldest daughter. We had an argument because just the life she's living right now and the things that she's going through, and I had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation. We got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear the stuff that you're saying, even though it's true. They may be going through something they don't want to hear, but we got into an argument about it, but that just happened. I just told her my-\nHow close are you to them?\nI'm sorry?\nHow close are you to them?\nVery close. The situation my daughter is in right now, she just needs to make some changes to better her life. She's kind of like stubborn in her own way. I was raised to listen to your mom. Your mom was not going to tell you nothing wrong. I've been telling her over the years different things. It's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite, and now she's regretting it. She's like, my mom told me this. Why am I doing the opposite? I guess she's got to bump her head a couple of times to get it. It's kind of like I didn't tell you, I didn't leave it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change.\nHow hard is that?\nIt's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. It seems like it's taking forever for her to change, but it's left up to the individual when they're ready. You know what I mean? Once a person gets tired of something, they make a change. It may not be when you want it to happen, but the ball is in her court. I only can do so much.\nI see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep?\nOh, wow. I have my days. Since I have two little ones, I kind of like train them to go to bed at 8 o'clock because they've got to go to school. I think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kind of like gets you ready for the next day. How are you going to feel if you rest? What type of person are you going to be that day? I'm going to be that day because everybody has their days, whether they're good or bad, but that's just part of life. I feel like if you had a good night's rest, hopefully you'll have a good day.\nDo you feel that way often?\nPretty much. I need my rest because I'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people. The job itself is very stressful, so I feel like if I'm rested it'll help me.\nWhat are you like when you don't sleep well?\nIrritated, tired, lazy. I feel like I'll want to lay down and probably go to sleep and get the rest that I need.\nWhat do you do when you're annoyed?\nI never thought about that. Like I said, everybody has their moments, they do.\nHave you ever served in the military?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo. Okay.\nHow would your best friend describe you?\nI don't really have a best friend, but a person that I deal with, that I used to work with, she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing, a go-getter, dependable, responsible. I'm a people person. I get along with others. I leave a good mark, whether I know you or not. If you were like you and I now, you'd probably say, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever, something like that.\nThat's great. Thank you. When was the last time you felt really happy?\nWell, I try to stay happy. I'd rather be happy than sad. My kids keep me going, you know what I mean? Especially when I go to pick them up from school or maybe, hey mom, you know, that just kind of like make my day. Just them run up to me, you know, and be happy and excited. Yeah.\nThat's so good to hear. Thank you. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're more than welcome. You have a good day. Goodbye.\nGoodbye. Thank you.\nYou're welcome. So I'm going to turn all this off and then we can just have a little closer look. Okay. That is so interesting. Mm-hmm.",
         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression. I try to stay happy, preferring that over being sad, and my kids really keep me going and sane, especially when they greet me from school. However, I definitely have my days, especially when I don't get enough sleep. When I'm not well-rested, I become irritated, tired, and lazy, feeling like I just want to lay down and get the rest I need. My job as a bus operator is very stressful, so getting good rest is crucial for me to handle it.\n\nLife as a single parent is hard and can be expensive, but I work to keep food in the house and support my kids the best way I can. I also experience a lot of frustration, particularly with my oldest daughter's situation. It's like talking to a wall sometimes, and it's frustrating that she's not hearing me, even though I'm trying to help her make changes to better her life. I've also had a lot of deaths around me, which is part of life experience.\n\nTo cope, I find peace in things like reading, taking long walks, hot baths, meditating, or just closing my eyes. I prioritize my rest because I know it helps me manage the stress of my job and daily life. I also believe in learning from mistakes and always trying to better myself, like going back to school now to advance my career.",

My mood was just not right. I was always feeling down and depressed and lack of energy, always wanting to sleep. Lack of interest. Do you feel like therapy's useful? I've gone to therapy. It has been useful for me in the past. Is it useful for me now? I don't know, I don't have health insurance. I would love to talk to someone. I just feel like I don't have anyone. So I don't depend on anyone. Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Oh yeah, I've always felt depressed in my life. What were your symptoms? Lack of energy, wanting to sleep a lot, lack of interest. My appetite was uncontrollable, either lack of or I was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things.

And so now it's just, it's been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and get my life back together. I don't know what advice I would give myself when I started with my corporate job 20 years ago. Okay, I didn't know I'd be here 20 years later. You know? Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy? A couple days ago this week, I've been trying to make ends meet. I've got a lot of things prouding. I've got a lot of things that are happening for me, but I need like two more weeks here in LA so I can connect the dots. But financially I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. So I was happy because I was getting callbacks. Things were starting to look up for me, but it's just time again isn't on my side. So my car is packed and I'm hitting the road and I'm taking off and I'm leaving LA. How would your best friend describe you? Loyal, emotional, strong, and a little bit of a Do you consider yourself an introvert? I have been lately. I was an extrovert for 20 years when I was a corporate manager. And now I am quite an introvert and I stay to myself. What made you decide to do that?

What are you doing to make music? I produce hip hop. I rap and produce hip hop. I play video games and then hang out with people. Awesome. Do you do music? No. How are you doing? Not very good. I break things. When was the last time you argued with someone? On the way over here, my mom and how to get here. What's the thing you like about LA? The beach. What's on your computer?

Have you ever been back in Mexico City? No. Have you ever been back in Mexico City? Yes. How long ago were you back in Mexico City? Like four years ago. Okay. Did you go there long? Right now, no. How easy is it to be back in Mexico City? Lately, not very easy. Did you go that way often? No. Just lately. Did you sleep at a park outside? I went there before my wife left, like three weeks ago, and after that I haven't been able to sleep. How do you help yourself? I just bury my head in stuff. I don't know. I just do stuff. I try to keep my mind off of it. I do yoga and other things to keep my mind off of everything. Have you ever been to therapy now? I never went to therapy. Why? Wait. No. I did go to therapy. When was the last time you went to therapy? Three or four years ago. I went to a separate therapist, but then I went to a thing where they did a bunch of cognitive tests and memory tests, and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time. I get depressed and it lasts for months on end. What type of therapy do you do? Okay. What were your symptoms? I don't know. What the fuck? Let's come back to that later. Yeah. Do you have any memories of that? I mean, my wife left like three weeks ago, so yes. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done, so yeah. Well, considering I'm only 19, if I could go back 19 years, I would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would have drove away my wife and not to be angry. Yeah. Driving away my wife. Yes, many, many things every day. Well, I could have not broken stuff, and I could have stopped. Like I was basically blocking out the external universe, and I was putting everything into myself and focusing on other things so that I don't focus on the real life. I was basically escaping. And so in that sense, I wasn't paying attention to her, and that's basically why she left. I mean, that and being angry is like both contributed their own proportion. Their own portion. Earlier today. I mean, I feel really happy all the time, and then it just goes away. It's like back and forth. Like one day, one second, I'll be really happy, and then another second, I'll be really sad because I'll think about something again. It's like I got to keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like think. And I really know how to explain it. It's just something you feel. No, you need better programming. Silly. I'm creative, potential of intelligence. Charming. I'm loving. At some points, I'm all of those things. At some points, I'm not. Doing yoga and playing video games and having my wife around. My hip hop. I mean, kid travel here. You need better programming. Kid Traveller is my friend. To be a hip hop artist. I don't know. I just started one day. Not hard anymore. I mean, it was hard when I was practicing when I was younger. I was like 11 or 12. Now it's just easy. I'm still in school. No problem. Have a nice day.",

Do you have a local? No. The last place I went was Los Cabos. No. Not Los Cabos. Where did I go? Somewhere in Mexico. Have you ever seen the ocean? Have you ever been back in Mexico City? No. Have you ever been back in Mexico City? Yes. How long ago were you back in Mexico City? Like four years ago. Okay. Did you go there long? Right now, no. How easy is it to be back in Mexico City? Lately, not very easy. Did you go that way often? No. Just lately. Did you sleep at a park outside? I went there before my wife left, like three weeks ago, and after that I haven't been able to sleep. How do you help yourself? I just bury my head in stuff. I don't know. I just do stuff. I try to keep my mind off of it. I do yoga and other things to keep my mind off of everything. Have you ever been to therapy now? I never went to therapy. Why? Wait. No. I did go to therapy. When was the last time you went to therapy? Three or four years ago. I went to a separate therapist, but then I went to a thing where they did a bunch of cognitive tests and memory tests, and then she diagnosed me with a type of depression that lasts for a long time. I get depressed and it lasts for months on end. Okay. What were your symptoms? I don't know. What the fuck? Let's come back to that later. Yeah. Do you have any memories of that? I mean, my wife left like three weeks ago, so yes. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever done, so yeah. Well, considering I'm only 19, if I could go back 19 years, I would say not to fuck up and let myself get depressed about certain things that would have drove away my wife and not to be angry. Yeah. Many, many things every day. Well, I could have not broken stuff, and I could have stopped. Like I was basically blocking out the external universe, and I was putting everything into myself and focusing on other things so that I don't focus on the real life. I was basically escaping. And so in that sense, I wasn't paying attention to her, and that's basically why she left. I mean, that and being angry is like both contributed their own portion. Earlier today. I mean, I feel really happy all the time, and then it just goes away. It's like back and forth. Like one day, one second, I'll be really happy, and then another second, I'll be really sad because I'll think about something again. It's like I got to keep my mind off of things and like move forward and like think. And I really know how to explain it. It's just something you feel. No, you need better programming. Silly. I'm creative, potential of intelligence. Charming. I'm loving. At some points, I'm all of those things. At some points, I'm not. Doing yoga and playing video games and having my wife around. My hip hop. I mean, kid travel here. Kid Traveller is my friend. To be a hip hop artist. I don't know. I just started one day. Not hard anymore. I mean, it was hard when I was practicing when I was younger. I was like 11 or 12. Now it's just easy. I'm still in school. No problem. Have a nice day.",
         "I'm not doing very good lately. My mood can be really up and down; one second I'll be really happy, and then another second I'll be really sad because I'll think about something again. It's like I have to constantly keep my mind off of things to move forward. I've been diagnosed with a type of depression that lasts for months on end.\n\nMy wife left about three weeks ago, and that's probably the hardest thing I've ever dealt with. Since then, I haven't been able to sleep. I've also been breaking things, and being angry was a big part of why she left. I realize now I was basically blocking out the external universe, focusing on other things to escape real life, and not paying attention to her.\n\nTo cope, I try to bury my head in stuff and just do things to keep my mind off everything. I do yoga and play video games, and I make music like rap and hip hop. I went to therapy three or four years ago, where I was diagnosed with long-lasting depression after some tests. If I could go back, I'd tell myself not to get depressed about certain things that drove my wife away and not to be angry.",

Okay, now you're going to chat with her for a bit, and then when you are done, I'm going to give you the doorbell again, and I'm going to put it right over there. Okay. When she says you're done talking, if you just want to ring it to let me know. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming to Music Week. I just created a song for people in the same community here in Miami. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me an email. And your answers are really important. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, are you doing okay? Quite well. I feel good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Here. Really? Mm-hmm. One of the few native-born Los Angelesians. What do you do now? I homeschool my 10-year-old son, and I'm a homemaker. I have five children and married 22 years. Wow. Mm-hmm. So that's a full-time job. Huh? Have you traveled a lot? Somewhat. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah. So I would say yes. I've traveled a bit. I'd love to hear about one of your friends. Well, most recently, like two months ago, we went to Israel for a pilgrimage. We were gone about nine days, and it was fabulous. We spent the first five days in Korazim, which is near the Galilee, and in a place called... I mean, the name of the area is Korazim, but we stayed in a place called the Doma Scalileia, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. That's so good to hear. What do you enjoy about traveling? I enjoy... Really, the most important thing I enjoy is meeting the people and, of course, seeing the history, especially Israel. I mean, it's totally ancient, but most I enjoy is the people, I think, to get a better understanding of how different cultures live. Okay. You can do this all by yourself? No, not at all. Why? Just don't. All my life, I've always been open and willing to socialize, and I remember my younger brother always joking, saying that I would talk to anybody, and I will. I'll talk to just about anybody, just because I enjoy learning about other people. That's good. What do you do to relax? By the end of the day, after I've cooked dinner, and we've had dinner together as a family, there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while, and then watch TV, have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax. That's what we do. Because we have a lot going on, we don't stay up too late, and I like to watch crime dramas. Nice. What does it mean to be really mad? Really mad? Probably not a lot. I get frustrated with, for example, my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever, so that gets me angry. In terms of really getting heatedly angry, other than little things that my children do, especially my oldest child who's 21, he can be confrontational. Other than that, nothing really gets me really angry. I haven't felt that. What's the best thing about being human? Contributing to society, helping to raise responsible people, I guess. Of course, the love and the affection and the fun and the excitement that goes with it, and all the stages that go. Right now, I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers. I have one 11-year-old, and the rest are all teenagers and adults. It's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world, and have challenging discussions and that sort of thing. It's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and changing diapers and that kind of stuff. What's the hardest thing about being human? The hardest thing is that it's 24-7. You're never not a parent, and so you have to accept that. I remember with my first child thinking, when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. There's no going back. I guess you could if you did something horrible, but in normal circumstances you can't change that. It's a permanent thing. In some ways it takes away your freedom, but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. I'm sorry? I didn't get what you said. Some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life, most importantly my church and my faith, but also my husband. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very logical thinking and very grounded. If I get emotional or I get upset about something, we balance each other out. Likewise, if he gets upset about something, I'm able to balance him out. That's been a great gift in my life. How do you do it completely? I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper. Occasionally I get angry, but rarely do I have outbursts. I'm more likely to say what I feel, not let it build up. My husband and I don't rarely fight, have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that. It almost never happens. Like I said, I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot. If I'm thinking something, I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. That's good. When was the last time you argued with your husband? Usually I'm arguing with my older son because he thinks he knows everything. He's 21 years old, so he has the know-it-all mentality. I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all. As life goes on, he'll learn more. He's very confident and very self-assured. He thinks that everything he does is correct. He still has a lot of learning to do. It sounds really hard. It can be. What do you think is a good kid? I think that many of them are spoiled and live in an environment of instant gratification, which I think is going to be detrimental to the future of this country. Given that, with all the technology we have, there's really not any way to go back. I have hope that they will... I think this country was built on hard work and ethics. Hopefully, the next generation and the generations after that can maintain that standard of living. I don't know if it's possible. How would your best friend describe you? As loving, nurturing, funny. We laugh a lot. Caring, honest. Things that... I mean, my best friend... Well, actually, my best friend is... It's two people, it's two sisters that I grew up with. We, for some years, took care of their mother who has Alzheimer's before my parents got sick. I have a very close relationship with them, still do. I'm considered the fourth sister. I would say that those are my best friends. We love each other very much. It's a good relationship. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long have you been diagnosed with depression? Minorally, depression. It was more anxiety. Probably... It's probably been five or six years. I've had it off and on all my life, but it was never diagnosed originally. As a teenager, I think is when I first started with the anxiety. Other than that, I... Depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. But now it's under control. I have a great... Are you triggered by something? No, I think it was what they call free-floating anxiety. I think it's a kind of organic reason for it. In other words, there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The holidays were great. We had a good family gatherings. A little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out. My dad is really sick. We've offered to move in with them. They have a big home, but we would have to do a lot of... Some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around. We're in the throes of that. That's a big change, but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get... They're in their 80s. As they get closer to death, I want to have my family there with them. I understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not easy. Usually, all my life I think I've always... I mean, I've always had... At least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, basically. Other than that, I mean, no. Now I sleep well. Other than that, I sleep well. But sometimes if I wake up really early in the morning, then I can't go back to sleep. I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on what my schedule is and if the kids have to be at school early. There's a lot of factors. That sucks. Yeah, sometimes it does. What are you making your sleep from? Probably basically the same. I think I might complain a bit like, oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever, you know. But I think overall I'm probably the same. My kids know. I'll tell my kids, oh, I'm really tired. And they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful. And maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know, they may pitch in a little bit more. I can understand she's using it to be there. Not really. Not, not, no. Not really. Not anything significant. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Actually, yes, I do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Tell me more about that. Well, we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety. And we have had her in therapy for some time. And we just recently are, we're about to finish a group with her. It was a six month group for DBT, it's called. And it's like a, it's the first time, it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And it's been really good. It's been very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental strategies to keep your, keep you from your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or, you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So that's the focus of the therapy. And it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter. And it's been really, really informational and really helpful, I think. That's so good to hear. What got you to see the company? Oh, my daughter was, she was in a bad way. She was, you know, suffering a lot. And we knew it and we acted on it. That's all. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Like really joyful and happy, I would say probably. I mean, probably it would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the, in Cana. So, you know, where the wedding of Cana took place. That was really moving and beautiful. And it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day. We flew to Israel. So it was right at the same time. It was beautiful. Very meaningful. And other than that, I would say, you know, like other joyful occasions have been, you know, like Christmas and, you know, family gatherings and, you know, my dad's birthday. He turned 83 on Christmas Eve, you know, that kind of thing. So. What are some things that you do? That's an interesting question. I would say once I get like things done that I need to do, like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once I get them done, I feel like a sense of accomplishment. You know, much like I mean, I worked for many years as an administrative manager at UCLA. And, you know, once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that you have to make deadlines. There's that feeling of like, yeah, I got it done, you know. So I think that would be, you know, for me, the most most recent way of feeling good and feeling, you know, like feeling accomplished. What's your dream job? Dream job? I think I've already lived it. I'm also a birth doula. And yeah, and so I've attended a lot of births and now I really only do it for family and friends. And it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth, the bringing of new life into this world. So I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and I didn't know it. I trained much after, you know, I did my managerial stuff and was it is and was awesome. So I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed. But like I said, I do for family and friends. What made you decide to do it? I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She she happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children. And I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. We were close friends and, you know, her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there. She wanted me to stay. She didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it. So that was the first birth that I attended outside of, you know, my self-giving birth, which is a whole different experience. So after that, I was really interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery. But then I discovered this thing called being a doula, which is really gives you even a lot more hands on one on one contact with the patient, which is what I like. So I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old. No, 16 years ago. So, yeah, and I've been. Well, it can be challenging in terms of hours. It depends on how long the woman's in labor. But and, you know, also like for me, I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100 percent. I'm not doing it for business. And that way and because of that, I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available, somebody else could fill in for me. So but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me, I've been able to be there for some reason. So the the the only one that I missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby. I was with her for her first, but her labor went so fast she didn't even call me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor. She would even if she had called me, I would have been there in time. So went really fast. But other than that, you know, yeah, I've been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In all of life or in your job? Probably my my own birth. I mean, my the birth of my own children. Like there's an extreme sense of joy, excitement, relief, because of course you're out of the pain. And then like it's just it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's it's like something you can't explain. It's it's just it's awesome after you give birth. So and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I had my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both both experiences. I was my third child that had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic. But other than that, we laugh about it now. But when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she she was not there when the doctor I mean, it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And my husband was there, but she was not. No, it was a doctor. And she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that. And my daughter was born in the bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor. But I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago, 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more not as relaxed, not as like I feel now at my age that I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry about I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what you know, you know, like my I notice my daughters. Oh, Mom, you can't wear that because people are going to say this. I say, I don't care. You know, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that, oh, Mom, you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever. So that would probably be it. The wisdom that you you achieve with age that you see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. Most proud of. Probably my family, my husband and my my children. I mean, the fact that we've stayed married, that we've were an intact family, that my kids see every day how their friends suffer, who who come from divorced families or single parents. And they they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. Probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years, I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people I know from church. And it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. OK. OK. Goodbye. Hello, Squick.",

I'll tell my kids, oh, I'm really tired. And they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful. And maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know, they may pitch in a little bit more. I can understand she's using it to be there. Not really. Not anything significant. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Actually, yes, I do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Tell me more about that. Well, we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety. And we have had her in therapy for some time. And we just recently are about to finish a group with her. It was a six month group for DBT, it's called. And it's like, it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And it's been really good. It's been very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental strategies to keep you from your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or, you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So that's the focus of the therapy. And it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter. And it's been really, really informational and really helpful, I think. That's so good to hear. What got you to see the company? Oh, my daughter was, she was in a bad way. She was, you know, suffering a lot. And we knew it and we acted on it. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Like really joyful and happy, I would say probably. I mean, probably it would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in Cana. So, you know, where the wedding of Cana took place. That was really moving and beautiful. And it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day. We flew to Israel. So it was right at the same time. It was beautiful. Very meaningful. And other than that, I would say, you know, like other joyful occasions have been, you know, like Christmas and, you know, family gatherings and, you know, my dad's birthday. He turned 83 on Christmas Eve, you know, that kind of thing. So. What are some things that you do? That's an interesting question. I would say once I get like things done that I need to do, like if I'm have a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once I get them done, I feel like a sense of accomplishment. You know, much like I mean, I worked for many years as an administrative manager at UCLA. And, you know, once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that you have to make deadlines. There's that feeling of like, yeah, I got it done, you know. So I think that would be, you know, for me, the most recent way of feeling good and feeling, you know, like feeling accomplished. What's your dream job? Dream job? I think I've already lived it. I'm also a birth doula. And yeah, and so I've attended a lot of births and now I really only do it for family and friends. And it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth, the bringing of new life into this world. So I would say that's probably was my dream job and I didn't know it. I trained much after, you know, I did my managerial stuff and was it is and was awesome. So I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed. But like I said, I do for family and friends. What made you decide to do it? I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children. And I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. We were close friends and, you know, her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there. She wanted me to stay. She didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it. So that was the first birth that I attended outside of, you know, my self-giving birth, which is a whole different experience. So after that, I was really interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery. But then I discovered this thing called being a doula, which is really gives you even a lot more hands on one on one contact with the patient, which is what I like. So I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old. No, 16 years ago. So, yeah, and I've been. Well, it can be challenging in terms of hours. It depends on how long the woman's in labor. But and, you know, also like for me, I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100 percent. I'm not doing it for business. And that way and because of that, I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available, somebody else could fill in for me. So but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me, I've been able to be there for some reason. So the only one that I missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby. I was with her for her first, but her labor went so fast she didn't even call me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor. She would even if she had called me, I would have been there in time. So went really fast. But other than that, you know, yeah, I've been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In all of life or in your job? Probably my own birth. I mean, the birth of my own children. Like there's an extreme sense of joy, excitement, relief, because of course you're out of the pain. And then like it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's like something you can't explain. It's just awesome after you give birth. So and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I had my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both experiences. I was my third child that had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic. But other than that, we laugh about it now. But when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she was not there when the doctor I mean, it was my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And my husband was there, but she was not. No, it was a doctor. And she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that. And my daughter was born in the bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor. But I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more not as relaxed, not as like I feel now at my age that I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what you know, like my I notice my daughters. Oh, Mom, you can't wear that because people are going to say this. I say, I don't care. You know, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that, oh, Mom, you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever. So that would probably be it. The wisdom that you achieve with age that you see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. Most proud of. Probably my family, my husband and my children. I mean, the fact that we've stayed married, that we've were an intact family, that my kids see every day how their friends suffer, who come from divorced families or single parents. And they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. Probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years, I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people I know from church. And it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. OK. OK. Goodbye. Hello, Squick.",
         "I've been diagnosed with depression, though it's been more minor depression and predominantly anxiety. I've had it off and on all my life, starting with anxiety as a teenager, but it was only formally diagnosed about five or six years ago. My anxiety is what they call free-floating, likely due to a chemical imbalance, not specific triggers.\n\nCurrently, my anxiety and depression are under control, and I've been feeling pretty good lately, especially after the holidays. However, sleep has always been a challenge for me; I often wake up in the middle of the night. If I wake up too early, I sometimes can't go back to sleep and might get up to do computer work before trying to sleep again. When I'm feeling tired or my body hurts, my kids notice and sometimes pitch in to help, like my older daughter being helpful or my other daughter trying to cook dinner.\n\nMy husband is a great support; we balance each other out if one of us gets emotional or upset. I also believe therapy is useful. We've been attending group therapy for DBT with our daughter, who also suffers from anxiety, and it's been very helpful for learning strategies to manage our minds and worries.",

Yes, I do. Well, I'm a football recruiter, so I travel all around the world to sign different football players for our sports management company. Just the independence about it being alone, being able to be free and not tied down to one thing, you know, it's great. I remember traveling to. And take them to clubs and this and that. We're not that type of organization. Yeah. This honesty. I don't like when people are dishonest. That really, really, really bothers me and not true, not honest, not real. That that upsets me a lot. I tend to just try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind. I usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head. I'm okay with it at times, but I can definitely be better. Oh, I argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school and she she wants to raise her one way. And I think I want to raise her a kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations. So I think different discipline is a big key in a kid's life and she she she was raised a little differently. I don't know, just angry, upset, you know, when you're in an argument, that's what you feel. So you do and say things that that that bother you and you just you go on with it. Yeah, a little bit. I don't know. I just just the way I feel. I don't know. I can't really say just the way I feel. A little, a little. I don't know, just realness. Honesty, truth, just being straight out front. I'm pretty close. I'm pretty close with my family. Oh, oh, another subject just they're raised different. I think society is going to become even wilder the way the kids are raised and no discipline and the things they're doing, everything we we they live in, everything inflated so much to where it's getting to a point where it's getting out of hand. I think kids these days to a certain extent are much wilder than I was and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and you know, just education wise.

Irritated. Tired. I don't know. It's been a while. It's been a while. A couple weeks ago. What did you say? No, not really. I think he would describe me as a stand up guy. I try to be a good loyal friend and an adult. I think he would describe me like that. School. Once school grew up together. I've been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life. Yeah. We're very close. My friends and I are very close. We pretty much do a lot together still at this age. I'm honest. I'm loyal. Very loyal. I'm an art worker. I think I am to a certain extent I'm just not the average guy. I'm pretty much I'm a different breed. I just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy. I think I learned that from him a lot. It's kind of the same path I took. A lot of things I regret. I regret a lot of decisions in my life. Yeah, one. I actually let a lady of my life go years ago that I felt was my soul mate. We had a big argument. One thing led to another. We decided to take a break. I started dating somebody else and I told her I'm going to go my way and she went her way. I think that was a bad decision. Very bad decision. Yeah, totally. I think I could have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of being so upset and moving forward. I'm just upset. I tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded. I need to think a little more when I'm upset. I don't know. Just experience the time. Make enough for your mistakes and being better about these decisions after you made the mistakes. Think a little harder about situations and things and the decisions that you make. Think a lot longer and harder before you make them and I think the outcome will be a little different today. My grandmother, she's always been a positive influence. She's a great black woman with old school ways of living. I think I've added that to my life. She's a great woman. She's a great woman. I was a pretty good player.

At the time it was a great thing and still is a great thing. It's a great accomplishment in my life. Accomplishments. Being able to, if I have a goal or something I'm supposed to do that week or that day and I accomplish it always puts me in a good mood. Or getting my job done the way I'm supposed to do it in a timely fashion always puts me in a good mood. Being a positive role model right now for younger kids that's in our sports academy program. I think as I got older the thought process and the way I look at life has totally changed. I think a lot of kids can look up to me that I deal with now and say that's somebody that is a positive influence in my life.

Let's see if I can start you up. Oh, actually, before that, one thing I almost forgot, I have to do something that syncs our equipment. There we go. All right. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just creative to talk to you about the world and state and the spirit environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And if things feel free to tell me everything, the answers are within comprehension. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm all right. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Oh, really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? The lights, the big city. It's always something going on. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic and that's it. Okay. What's your study at school? Business administration and business management. Are you still doing that? Not that. I'm doing networking at the moment. What's your dream job? Hmm. To open up a big clothing line and just supply the whole world with clothing. That sounds interesting. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Definitely. Why? Because I'm all about myself. It's all about me. Do you feel that way often? Not often, but more times than not, yeah. What are some things that you do really like? Being lied to and I guess when people think you're dumber than what you are. I understand. What do you do when you're in life? I try to get away from everything. Go into my own space. How are you at controlling your temper? Very well. I'm great at controlling my temper. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? Probably two days ago. It was probably just over some sports. It wasn't a real argument. Okay. Do you travel a lot? Not a lot, but I travel enough. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just being able to get a change of pace. See somebody new, see new faces, new environment. I'd love to hear about your trips. Let me see. The last trip I had was Vegas. You know how Vegas goes. It was pretty fun. There was a lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on. Nice. What would you say of somebody that's following you? Pretty open-minded. I'm kind to pretty much everybody. I'm a pretty even-killed guy. How do you like your living situation? It's alright. It could be better. Do you have roommates? No. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No, ma'am. Have you ever been diagnosed with stethoscopy? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Lately it's been pretty tough. I guess because I haven't stand up so late. That's my fault. Why? I don't know. I guess I'm a night owl all of a sudden. I'm turning into an owl. Okay. What are you like when you're not sleeping well? Sluggish and tired all day if I don't sleep well. All day I'm just laying around. Have you ever stayed in a hotel room? No. Not too much. Okay. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay focused and listen to the adults. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. Listen to the adults. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Tell me more about that. I mean, self-exponential. I think I just listened to parents or other adults that tried to stare you in the right way. You know, you're being a stubborn kid at those ages. So it's like, what are you talking about? It's my life. I can do what I want. I don't have to listen to you. But now I'm a good sleeper. I can still listen to you. But now I see that what they were telling me was correct. Yeah. How are your best friends describing you? Um, hilarious. Okay. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. You're someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Both my parents, mother and father. That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Recently, what did I do? New Year's Eve party. I had the time of my life. It was so fun. I'd love to hear all about it. This New Year's Eve, I went to a party at a friend's house in Balling Hills area. He had it at a pretty nice house. It's a three story house. And it was like 350 people in there. It was pretty fun. But it was also not that fun because it was so many people and you couldn't really move. So that was the only downfall. I brought my New Year in great with tons of friends. That's how it's supposed to be done. Awesome. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, I'm generally in a good mood every day. I mean, waking up puts me in a good mood. I guess you could say that. I don't know. I don't know. A good meal. That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? One of my most memorable experiences were probably when I was younger. I was in a Boy Scouts and we used to go camping all the time. And then one year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite, one of those places. And we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge. And of course being from the city I'm like mountain biking. I can ride a mountain bike. But once we got into the real mountains and got on real mountain bikes, I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers. It was pretty, it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense. I'll never forget that. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a tough one to answer. What am I most proud of? I don't know honestly. Bye. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one.",

It could be better. Do you have roommates? No. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No, ma'am. Have you ever been diagnosed with stethoscopy? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Lately it's been pretty tough. I guess because I haven't stand up so late. That's my fault. Why? I don't know. I guess I'm a night owl all of a sudden. I'm turning into an owl. Okay. What are you like when you're not sleeping well? Sluggish and tired all day if I don't sleep well. All day I'm just laying around. Have you ever stayed in a hotel room? No. Not too much. Okay. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay focused and listen to the adults. Listen to the adults. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Tell me more about that. I mean, self-exponential. I think I just listened to parents or other adults that tried to stare you in the right way. You know, you're being a stubborn kid at those ages. So it's like, what are you talking about? It's my life. I can do what I want. I don't have to listen to you. But now I see that what they were telling me was correct. Yeah. How are your best friends describing you? Um, hilarious. Okay. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. You're someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Both my parents, mother and father. That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Recently, what did I do? New Year's Eve party. I had the time of my life. It was so fun. I'd love to hear all about it. This New Year's Eve, I went to a party at a friend's house in Balling Hills area. He had it at a pretty nice house. It's a three story house. And it was like 350 people in there. It was pretty fun. But it was also not that fun because it was so many people and you couldn't really move. So that was the only downfall. I brought my New Year in great with tons of friends. That's how it's supposed to be done. Awesome. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, I'm generally in a good mood every day. I mean, waking up puts me in a good mood. I guess you could say that. I don't know. A good meal. That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? One of my most memorable experiences were probably when I was younger. I was in a Boy Scouts and we used to go camping all the time. And then one year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite, one of those places. And we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge. And of course being from the city I'm like mountain biking. I can ride a mountain bike. But once we got into the real mountains and got on real mountain bikes, I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers. It was pretty, it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense. I'll never forget that. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a tough one to answer. What am I most proud of? I don't know honestly. That's a good one.",
         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression. Lately, getting a good night's sleep has been pretty tough, which I think is my fault because I've been staying up so late, turning into a night owl. When I don't sleep well, I feel sluggish and tired all day, and I just end up laying around. Generally, though, I'm in a good mood every day; waking up puts me in a good mood, and so does a good meal. I definitely consider myself an introvert because I'm all about myself, and I feel that way more times than not. When I'm feeling \"in life,\" like when people lie to me or think I'm dumber than I am, I try to get away from everything and go into my own space.",

When she's done, she'll let you know. I'm going to put the doorbell right next to you. So when she's done, just let me know. Hi, I'm Ellie. I'm a student at the University of New York. I'm not a very good student, but I'm very learning about people. I'm a graduate of the University of New York. I like to do research and research. I'm a student here at the University of New York. I like to do research and research. Are you a student here at the University of New York? Yes. So, are you Indian? Okay. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from India. Why do you miss the land? Why do I miss the land? Why do I miss LA? When did you start? Oh, about 20 years ago. How often do you go back to LA? Once every 3-4 years. How did you get used to it? I mean, the first 6 months it was a little difficult. But then I got used to it and I feel very comfortable now. That's good. Are you comfortable? Yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? The food. Actually, I enjoy flying, then meeting different people, different scenes. Then I try to achieve my goals. I'm sorry? How did you get involved in the business? I used to run a business. I used to travel to meet people, to get orders. Traveling involved going to Northeast, Ohio and Pennsylvania, places like that. Meet top people to get orders for my business. I enjoyed listening to their problems. I used to take them out for dinner. I genuinely enjoyed talking to them. Many of them were open enough to tell me about their problems. But my main goal, main objective was to get the orders for the business. Nice. What do you do for a living? I cook, watch movies, meet friends, throw a party. What do you do now? I'm talking to you. What did you study before? I'm an engineer. I did mechanical engineering. I'm also an MBA. Are you still working on it? Actually, I branched off to finance. I trade stocks now. How did you get involved in the business? A friend of mine was making a lot of money in stocks. First, I used to interact with him. I realized he was making a lot of money. Then I did a formal course in it. I attended a lot of seminars. Lost a lot of money before I started making money. What do you do for a living? I watch movies, visit people, play basketball, do shopping, cook. How are you doing? I'm very good at controlling my temper. When was the last time you argued with your brother? The last time I argued was with my brother. It was about my dad. He's getting old. He lives in India. I was planning on bringing him here. My brother said it's going to be very expensive with respect to health bills. I was arguing with him that we should all pull in the money and get them here. They are quite old. I have a mom too. They are both old. How close are you with your family? I'm very close to my parents. Not so close with my brother and their family. Why? I tend to be judgmental. I think sometimes that my niece and nephew should have been brought up in a different way. My brother doesn't seem to think along the same lines. We have disagreements and that's the reason. Do you think it's going to happen? It is. Do you believe in their race? No, not at this time. What do you think is going to happen? What do I think of what? What do you think is going to happen? Can you repeat that one more time? What do you think is going to happen? I still couldn't follow you. What's the matter with you? Have you ever served in the army? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. How long ago were you diagnosed? About one to two years ago. What made you decide to go into the army? I was feeling down and I was not interested in things that I was normally interested in. I was sort of withdrawn and I was not able to focus on my things. I went to see a doctor and I ended up doing that. Did you ever have trouble sleeping? No. What made you decide to go into the army? I lost appetite. I was not sleeping well. I had difficulty concentrating and focusing. I was not getting my assignments done on time. These were some of the problems. How have you been doing lately? I've been feeling good. You've been doing yoga? No, I don't. Why didn't you stop doing yoga? I started doing yoga and I've been doing that for about a year. And meditation. That's helped a lot. Awesome. What made you decide to do it? It's just that when I was diagnosed with depression, I thought I shouldn't be taking any medication for it. I was looking at other ways to get over the problem. Then I realized some of my friends were doing meditation and I got influenced by them. How easy is it to get rid of depression? It's a little difficult. But I've been able to sleep within half an hour. There are days when it takes almost one or two hours to go to sleep. Are you better by sleeping? Are they what? Can you repeat that? Are you better by sleeping? No. What are you working on these days? When did you last do yoga? Okay. What are you most proud of? What am I proud of? I was among the top 2% in my MBA class. When I used to run my business, I designed a product that was working really well. I was happy that I was able to design something that was so useful for my business. How are your best friends? I'm thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly, very easy to get along with, very focused, very intelligent, and a good cook. Who's your best friend? Albert Einstein. Can you tell me about that? Some of his theories involve a lot of deep thinking. The first few times I read about him, about his theories, I had difficulty in really understanding that. When there are things that I really try to understand and I'm not able to, they're all the type of people I admire. What advice would you give yourself? I would say to be open to other people. What is the thing you like about yoga? It's diverse and I like the entertainment industry. I like the fact that there are more women than men here. There are certain areas where only Spanish is spoken. I would like for all people who come to America to be able to understand English and be able to speak in English so that everybody can participate. What is the thing you like about doing yoga? In LA? What is the thing you like about doing yoga? Some of the things the political leaders do really make me mad. Sometimes I think they're wasting their time, our time, and other countries are advancing. These guys don't get things done and I feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry. What advice would you give to people? The first four years of the Obama administration I think it was wasted because if Congress had acted together and got things done, then maybe we could have made it much more difficult for China to catch up with us. The fact that China is able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still argue and find faults with each other and not get things done. They don't seem to realize that the clock keeps ticking. They have to get things done. What's one thing that makes you feel bad? One thing that comes to my mind is that I made a lot of money once in Los Angeles. I remember that it happened during Christmas some 10 years ago and that made me very happy. What is something that makes you feel bad? Good music, good food, a party with friends that I like, and I also like cooking and I enjoy cooking with groups. Those are things that really put me in a good mood. What advice would you give to people? I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope it was worth your time. Thank you so much. You've been nice. Bye. Thank you.",

I even like visiting different airports. Everyone's different. Oh, let's see. I started off in high school. I was in the pre-med. I ended up in physics. Yes, I teach physics. And math. My dad was a truant officer. And I've enjoyed it. It keeps you young. My dream job would be to be a judge. Yes, in the youth court. I'm not going to be able to do that. No. Not at all. I enjoy people. Being around people. I'm very talkative at times. I like to do a lot of things. I'm very social when I do them. Believe it or not, I play bridge. I play chess. And I watch a good old, old movie. Ooh. Bad drivers. Bad laws. Politics often. What do you do when you're annoyed? I really don't get annoyed that much. I just let it go. It's not worth the pain and problems it could cause. If I can't straighten out a problem, let it go. Go somewhere else. Always my bridge partner. But that's different. As far as anything else, I don't really argue with people. I don't like confrontation. My parents, of course. I had great parents. Can you tell me about that? My parents were at Tuskegee, which is a black college. They always want me to go to a black college, but of course I didn't want to do that. They're a very positive role model for me. I don't drink. I don't curse. I don't look down on people who do, but I don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things. I love to drive. I love to travel. My dad used to always take us someplace every weekend he was off. We'd go somewhere. We were in Chicago, Indiana, Michigan. Someplace in the area. We'd go to Michigan and pick fruit. We'd go to puppy farms in Indiana, that kind of thing. I had an uncle who lived in Wisconsin who was a dairy farmer. My dad used to love to drive, and I love to drive also. That's a hard one. I've had a lot of great experiences. I think the best one was we went, for my anniversary we went to Europe. We went to Paris. We rode the Orient Express. We didn't go all the way to Istanbul. We went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris. That was probably the best experience I've ever had in my life. I've never really cared for Europe because there's so much here in the United States to do and so much in America. I've been to Alaska and Hawaii, but we said we'd do something different. We'd always want to go on the Orient Express. We did that. Expensive, but a phenomenal trip. You've got to do it once. It's a once trip. Not once in a lifetime, just once. Not traveling more sooner. There are a lot of things we should have probably done we didn't do. We always went to Chicago on Thanksgiving, but I think we should have gone more than just on Thanksgiving. My parents come here around Christmas time, but I think we should have done a lot more when it comes to that. Yes, that's why it's a regret because it could have been avoided. We could have done a lot more things we could have done and we would have spent our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us. I think that people... Oh yes, very definitely. That's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago. I would have said don't take things too seriously, but don't be too relaxed over them either. Sometimes you can take things for granted. Never take anything for granted. Nothing's promised. Oh, heaven forbid. No, I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Very, very easy. I really have no problem with that. Once in a while. If I'm anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due, then I get kind of anxious a little bit. I don't like to be late. I don't like to make mistakes. Therefore, I do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that everything is right. What are you like when you're just being blown? Tired. I don't get irritable or anything. I'm just nostalgic maybe. I'm just a little bit. How have you been feeling lately? Very good. I was up late last night, so I'm kind of tired now. I usually have no problem sleeping. I get a good night's sleep. I just came back off a Christmas break. I should be very relaxed now. What are you most proud of in your life? I have great kids. I have a son at USC. I have a son at UCLA. My daughter just got married. I'm really proud of my kids. They're going to have a good life. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I enjoyed it. I still enjoy it. Being a parent is forever. What's the best thing about being a parent? Taking care of someone else and getting them started off to have a good life. I think that that's rewarding. Making sure everything is covered. That needs to be covered with your kids. Whether it's their eating, their sleeping, their clothes, their dress, make sure they're content. Make sure they have no problems at school or at home. Physically, mentally, spiritually, everything. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend would say she has not changed since high school. Level-headed, but a great sense of humor. Relaxed. I don't take things too seriously. When was the last time you felt really happy? I love the holidays. I love Christmas. I love everything about it. I love preparing the house for it. I love baking and cooking. Especially baking. I love experimenting with new recipes. The last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here, I felt fantastic. Everything is quiet. I'm not at work. I'm not stressed out in any way at all. I have no projects to do. I have to think about it anyway. Christmas time. Holiday time. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I really enjoyed it recently. Well, Christmas of course. We went to Las Vegas on the 27th of December. That was fantastic. We only stayed for two days. We had a really good time. We saw a great show. We had some great food. We drove there. We don't usually drive. I don't like to drive a lot, but we drove there and just took our time. That sounds like a great situation. It was good. It was nice. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye. Thanks for listening. How's that one? Okay. I have to ring the bell. My mind is wandering. Here we go. Hi there. Okay. Actually, before I do that, let me see if I can get the mic on. Okay.",

         "I generally feel very good and relaxed, especially after a break. I love the holidays, particularly Christmas, and during that time, I feel fantastic because everything is quiet, and I'm not stressed with work or projects. I don't tend to get annoyed easily; I prefer to just let things go, as I don't believe it's worth the pain or problems. I also avoid confrontation and arguments. When I'm just tired, I'm simply nostalgic, not irritable.\n\nI usually have no problem getting a good night's sleep. However, if I'm anxious about upcoming deadlines or projects, or worried about being late or making mistakes, that anxiety can keep me up all night to ensure everything is done perfectly. I enjoy being around people; I'm very social and talkative, and I like to do a lot of things like playing bridge and chess, or watching old movies. I'm very proud of my children and find being a parent rewarding, focusing on ensuring they are well taken care of physically, mentally, and spiritually.\n\nI've never been diagnosed with depression or PTSD. My main challenge is this anxiety related to performance and perfectionism, which occasionally affects my sleep. My coping strategies involve letting go of problems I can't fix, avoiding confrontation, and engaging in social activities and hobbies. My parents were great, positive role models, and I have a very big family. My anxiety is primarily triggered by work deadlines and my desire for perfection.",

Who's someone that's been a positive employee? My family. I'd love to hear all about it. My mother. She's a very good-hearted person. Gives me good advice. That's good. What are some things you like to do for fun? Oh, pretty close. Yeah. Family comes first. Family's number one. Yeah. What are some things you like to do for fun? Go to the gym. You know, exercise. Go to the beach. Party every once in a while. Watch basketball, football. Okay. Take trips. Go to Vegas. What's the last time you had that? Which one? Went to the gym last night. I have friends that live in Vegas, so I go there often. Enjoying the travel? I just take a trip, get out. Get away from the city for a minute. But I'm a city boy, so it can't be way too long. You know, head up the city. What do you do to relax? I don't go to the beach. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, that's been a problem over the years. What's the only thing you worry about? I don't know. I just have a little anger, I guess. Anger management problem. When was the last time you had a problem with someone? Probably only yesterday. I forget what it was about. What do you do when you're in life? I go to the gym. What are some things that will be really annoying? People. Tell me more about that. I don't know, just people. Just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes. Okay. What's your dream job? Dream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Plan Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far, the past 10 years. Then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX. I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA Airport. Nice. What's one thing that most number of people experience? What, working at the airport? I guess during the holidays there was some girl that worked there. I had a crush on her, but she turned out to be a lesbian. She's beautiful. Yeah. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. Have you been diagnosed with a disease? I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No. Why did you stop? I just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped. I'm sorry you're late. No problem. It's not your fault. Do you think it's their disease? Excuse me? Did your parents just help you? It wasn't when I was a teenager. Tell me more about that. What, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know? How have you been doing lately? I'm not going forward as fast as I want to. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is. Have you done anything to avoid it? To avoid what? Going forward? I guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would. Excuse me? Yeah, I guess. Are there? Yeah, it's like mood swings, I guess. Mood swings? Are you triggered by something? It could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know? When was the last time you had a mood swing? Oh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today. Really? How did you fool around with me? Angry. How hard is it? Yeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know? Do you think you're going to be able to control it? No. Okay. How are your best friends? My best friends? My best friends? Excuse me? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? The goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted. That's great. Thank you. Is that even your address? Yeah. Yes. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then. What made you decide to do that? To do what? To do what? Let's come back to that earlier. When was the last time you were in the house? I don't know. Today. Happy to be here. That's great. What are some things that you really put into your life? Um, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah. What would you say is something you've best followed in? My best qualities? Just that, uh, qualities. Just that I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What do you mean by qualities? What comes to your mind? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay. I think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay, bye. Can I take her home with me? Is she, um, is she supposed to be a psychiatrist or can I hire her? Okay.",

I don't think I'll be able to control it. People can get on my nerves sometimes, which is annoying. My friends describe me as outgoing with a good sense of humor, but they understand when I'm going through something or get mad easily, though I can also laugh right after.

To cope, I go to the gym and work out, go to the beach, or take trips to get away for a minute. My family, especially my mother, is a big support, giving me good advice and always coming first.",

         " Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. I'm fine. This is a little bit strange, you know, talking to a virtual human. I was born, I was born in LA. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived in the city of San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I was born in LA. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived all over Los Angeles. I've lived in the valley, Long Beach, and now I'm in Culver City. Awesome. What are some things you really like about LA? There's great food here. The weather is great most of the time. There's a lot of sunshine. I think that's really great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? That is a much longer list I would like to get out of here. The traffic, I think that's number one. I think everybody hates the traffic. And everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to get together with anybody. Everybody's so devoted to their jobs and then we're sitting in traffic a lot too. Yeah. What did you study at school? I studied Marine Biology. Wow. That sounds interesting. Why did you decide to do that? I went to school and I originally studied graphic design and I found that kind of unfulfilling. So I took a trip for a while, traveled around the world, and started scuba diving. And I realized that I really loved Marine Biology. So that's how I got into it. Nice. What's your dream job? Everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since I just graduated. I think I would like to... I think maybe managing a research... I'm not really sure. I think I would like to... Something in Tropical Marine Ecology, maybe managing a preserve, something like that. It's a hard question to answer. I do. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I traveled for eight months in Central America. And I visited a lot of different countries. I... I traveled a lot. I traveled a lot. I went to different countries. I went scuba diving. Wow. What are some things that you're doing now? I think intolerance, injustice in the world. I think intolerance, injustice in the world. Those are probably the things that get me the most fired up. What do you do when you're annoyed? Brant to my boyfriend. Does that count? How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. Very few people have seen me angry. To the point where I'm kind of yelling and screaming angry. I don't know. I just don't get there. I think that I'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper, so I keep it under control. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone you loved or loved without? It was yesterday, actually. I argued with my boyfriend about getting a job. I was talking about taking a job somewhere, and he was being very supportive. I really wanted him to say, No, don't go take that job for six months because I would miss you. He was just being supportive. We kind of argued about that. It was ridiculous, so I ended up laughing. That's good. What do you do to relax? Meditate, exercise, go out in nature. Just unplug, get myself away from a computer, away from technology, away from people. Okay. How close are you to your family? I would say not really. I'm an only child, and it's just me and my parents, and we're very, very dissimilar. For example, I'm a pretty adventurous person. I like learning, and my parents are couch potatoes. They like to watch reality television. We don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activities. I love them and everything, but there's not too much common ground. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Yes. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I don't think I'm a social person. I think I'm a social person. I think I'm a social person. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I seem to find most social encounters to be draining, whereas my boyfriend, for example, he derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people. For me, it's always a little bit the opposite. I have to recharge. How are your best friends? I'm not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He's kind of my best friend. I'm not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He would probably say passionate, intelligent. He always tells me that I'm really hard on myself, which is true. Dedicated, loyal. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm just proud of who I am. I don't know if that's the answer that most people give, but I think that I'm really proud of who I am. I try really hard. I've done a lot of things in my life. I'm a really good person. I think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind, and I consider myself a kind person that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so I'm proud of that. That's so good to hear. Have you ever served in military? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I was probably about 15 at the time, so I think 17 years ago. You were very young weren't you? Yes. What got you to see the doctor? I was diagnosed with depression. I called my parents and let them know, and at that point they took me in for treatment. That wasn't the first time I had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist, but before it was more, they thought I had ADHD. So it was, I think, my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help. Do you still go to therapy now? I haven't for about three years. I was checking in with a parole officer. I just wasn't enjoying the relationship I had, but I still have a psychiatrist that I go to for med checks. That sucks. Do you feel like they're useful? I do think it's useful if you have the right therapist. I think if you don't have a good relationship with a therapist, it can be incredibly harmful. I have talked to people that have had bad experiences How have you been feeling lately? Lately I've been a little bit down. I should say a little bit more down than usual because I graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things 24-7 has come to an end. Without the routine, it's been a little bit weird finding out what to do with my... finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time. It's also been a little bit depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in California. That sounds really hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Almost impossible. Ever since I was a little kid, I had trouble falling asleep. About four years ago, it became really, really bad or I just couldn't sleep through the night. I was getting about four hours of sleep. Sometimes I would wake up every hour and I would wake up in the morning just to complete rec. For about four years, I've been taking trazodone so I can sleep. What are you looking down for these days? Have you ever seen Fight Club? You're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's pretty much like that. I'm just a complete panicked, anxious rec. I lose my ability to deal with things. I'm much more likely to lose my temper. I can't regulate my moods. I'm just really volatile. When was the last time you were happy? Probably a few months ago. I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a week, and I was just really, really happy. I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a weekend, and forgotten to take my medicine with me or something like that and then I can't sleep and so that's what happens. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy. I don't know. It's easier for me to keep track of when I feel really, really bad. Really happy. I guess I felt happy on New Year's Day and really happy on New Year's Eve, which was 10 days ago. I was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to Palm Springs and Joshua Tree and it was really nice to see them. I don't get to see them very often because I've been in school and I've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to real life. That's great. What would you say as somebody who has followed you? I think that I'm kind, I'm considerate, I'm tolerant, I'm pretty open-minded, I'm aware of my faults. I just try to be nice to everybody and I'm very curious about the world and things that I don't know about. I really like to learn. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think that I was in a relationship with my boyfriend and he was really nice to me What's one of your most memorable experiences? Off the top of my head, first thing that comes to mind is diving the blue hole in Belize. It was really amazing. It was me and my friends. We just jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this limestone sinkhole and it's really, really, really blue and you just drop down to about 140 feet in something like two minutes. We did it pretty quick, not everybody could do it that quick. As you go down, you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge, they're larger than a human because it's this cave system and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you. That was pretty good. What are some things you like to do for fun? I'm trying to remember that at the moment. I haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school. I guess reading, hiking, just being together with my friends, doing relatively low key things, going to movies, having dinner parties, cooking, playing with my cat. Is there anything you can remember? Not that I can really think of. I've made mistakes in my life, but I'm still here so it can't be that bad. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't know, hang in there. Hold on to your clothes because the 90s are coming back in fashion. What are some things that you believe have been a good way? There's someone that's been a positive influence on you. I think that's great. Especially the last year, he's really inspired me. He quit drinking, he quit smoking. He's made a lot of positive changes in his life. I know that those things aren't easy. So to see someone overcome that really inspired me. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thanks for having me.",

Hmm. Huh. Bigger city. More opportunity. Um, big city. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not often. Why? Um, I don't know. There's phones. I can call. I understand. What are some things you really like about LA? Um, let's see. The water. The ocean. Um, the big city. There's a lot to do. A lot of people. Um, the mountainous. Skiing. All kinds of stuff. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Okay. How close are you to your family? Close. You can do this on your own, right? No. Why? Because I like to talk. What's your dream job? Uh, maybe running a company. What did you study at school? Politics. What made you decide to do that? Parents. That sucks. I guess. You're using your mouth. Play my guitar. Cool. How are you at controlling your hunger? Um, it depends. I'd love to hear all about it. No, you wouldn't, but sure. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what did you tell them? Um, ex-girlfriend. I don't remember. How close are you to them? We've been close for a lot of years. How do you know them? I just know them for a long time. Okay. Is everything very well? No. What advice would you give yourself, Stan? I call yours now. Be a little more patient with her. What do you think of the new kids? Huh? What do you think of the new kids? Uh, they're okay. Okay. Have you ever said anything to them? No, but I helped. Tell me more about that. I did stuff with the Marines, which was fun, and I lived out of the country. What made you decide to do that? Which one? Living out of the country or helping with the Marines? Yes. How about the first one? Living out of the country? Because my parents lived out of the country. So I lived with them, you know. Oh. Do you travel a lot? Uh, used to. What are you enjoying about traveling? Um, the different sceneries, different period. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Which one? Europe? France? Yeah, it was cool. It was great, learning different languages and seeing different cultures and different people. It's enlightening, mind expansion, definitely. That sounds like a great situation. Hmm, to say the least. What was your most memorable experience? Berlin Wall. How did you feel about Berlin Wall? Uh, overwhelmed. Why? Because it was atrocities and stuff that went down during that war. I think you know. How easy is it for you to get into the next stage of your life? Man, that's a good question. Depends. Can you tell me about that? Well, depends on if I'm sleeping by myself or sleeping with somebody. I understand. What are you like when you're off the ground? Hmm. Agitated, I guess. I don't know. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Okay. Do you have any studies you want to do? No, not me. My girlfriend may say so. I don't know. Can you give me an example of that? I have no clue. She could tell you. Okay. Do you feel down? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Okay. How are your best friends guiding you? World win, I guess. A doer. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Persistence. What are your most proud of in your life? Achievements and goals. Accomplishments. Can you give me an example of that? I raced motocross and I was one of the first black professionals. Wow. Yeah, you ain't joking. I'm sorry. Yeah, pretty cool. What are some things that usually make you feel good? Guitar. Playing my guitar. When was the last time you went to the gym? Last night. Cool. Yeah. Tell me about your life. Playing. Playing chords and playing the songs. Okay. Tell me about something you've been doing that you really enjoy. Playing with some other musicians at a rehearsal studio. Awesome. How do you know them? Just acquaintances through other friends. And I like to fly too. I like flying planes. What are some things that you've been doing now? My girlfriend talking. My girlfriend sometimes. That's about it. I don't know. She's cool, but she's a little arrogant. Is it uncomfortable to talk about her? No, not really. Okay. There's some of us that have had positive influence in our lives. Hm? There's some of us that have had positive influence in our lives. My mom, my dad. Tell me about that. They're strong people. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. Maybe when I was flying last, flying in a private plane, I guess. You know, there's no reason to get super, super happy. And I guess if you're married, hopefully that'll make you super happy. But no, I'm pretty even-minded. I'm pretty happy. But no, I'm pretty even-kill. You know what I'm saying? I stay pretty level. Okay. I understand. I think I've got a lot of things to say. Oh, great. Well, it's nice talking to you. Thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. Goodbye. That was fun. Yeah, it was bizarre. I'm going to go ahead and shut off the recording. You can take the mic off. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and turn it off.",
         "Everything isn't very well for me. I can feel agitated sometimes, especially when I'm 'off the ground,' though I wouldn't say I feel 'down.' I don't really get 'super, super happy'; I'm more 'even-minded,' 'even-kill,' and I try to stay 'pretty level.' I guess there's just no reason to get 'super, super happy.'\n\nMy hunger control varies, and when asked about it, I felt like you wouldn't really want to hear about it. It's tough for me to get into the next stage of my life, and that seems to depend on whether I'm sleeping alone or with someone. I don't visit my hometown often, preferring to just call. My social life is somewhat limited, mostly with my girlfriend, who I think is cool but a bit arrogant. I know I need to be more patient with her. I've also been told I stare down.\n\nPlaying my guitar and flying planes are things that make me feel good and are when I last felt 'really happy.' I also make an effort to go to the gym, and I was there last night. I'm persistent, and my parents have been a strong, positive influence in my life, even if I don't see them often.",

I mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your likes, your dislikes, your problems and sometimes somebody else is going through the same thing you are and you can share what you're going through and what can help make it better. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It's affected me a lot. It's helped me cope with things. It's nice to have somebody else to talk to.

I sought help by going to a counselor and then group therapy. Group therapy has been particularly helpful because I can share my problems with others who are going through similar experiences, and we can support each other. Seeing a therapist has helped me cope with things and it's nice to have someone to talk to. I initially didn't want to admit I was depressed, but after feeling that way for so long, I knew I had to do something. Lately, I've been feeling pretty good, getting more positive and better. My sleep isn't great; it's about 50-50, some nights I sleep well, others I don't.

Your answers are really confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty well. That's good. Where are you from originally? From New York. Really?

I worry a lot about the future. I took classes, meditation and yoga classes, and it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and enjoy life a lot more. That's good. What do you do to relax? I meditate and do yoga. What are some things that you don't really like about LA? I don't get mad that often, but frustrated. I would say being stuck in traffic or people that do mean things to other people for no real reason. What do you do when you're annoyed? I usually talk to somebody about it if I can. That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? When was the last time you argued with someone? How did you feel about that? What did you do in that moment? Do you feel that way often? That's good. What are some things you like to do to find? What's one of your most memorable experiences? A trip I took to India and Nepal for six weeks. Can you travel a lot? Yeah, as much as I can.

I love backpacking in the wilderness and exploring nature. I'd love to hear about your trips. Cool. I went on a trip to India and Nepal. It was my first time ever there. The first week and a half I was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat. I went whitewater rafting on the Ganga River. Then I went off on my own for the rest of the trip. I went backpacking in Nepal with a guide there. It was really beautiful in the Annapurna area. Then I went back into India and explored the area up near Tibet. Then I went to Rajasthan and to a tiger park in Madai Pradesh. It was really close to tigers. How did you decide to do that? I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this trip. I'd always wanted to go to India. So I decided to do it. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was really fun.

No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I don't sleep as well as I did when I was younger. For the most part, I sleep well. Once in a while, I'll wake up at four or five in the morning when I want to sleep until seven. I'll not be able to get back to sleep. In general, it's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I feel tired and not as motivated as usual. I sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon. Okay. Have you ever studied using a video app? No. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago? I guess, too, I wish I would have invested money or bought a house or something when I was younger. That would probably be the advice I would give myself. Okay. What would you say is one of your best qualities? I am empathetic with other people, positive and have a positive outlook on life. I'm very determined when I decide to do something. I'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging. I'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things. I guess probably the strongest thing is that I'm pretty balanced. I'm very organized but I'm also pretty creative. I'm pretty balanced that way. That's good. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. Much closer than I was when I was younger. Although I'd say I'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than I'm able to get to my family. Okay. What are some things that you do that you think are good? Being outdoors and nature and exercising and also singing. What are you most proud of in your life? The fact that I've gone with, followed my heart and done what I wanted to do versus going with what I think I should do. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? I guess yesterday. I spent the day by the beach and just bicycled and went skating and visited some old friends there. How did you feel about that? I felt very relaxed and invigorated. I also felt like I missed living by the beach because I used to live really close to the beach. I guess a little bit sad that I didn't live there anymore but really happy to be there.

He was on drugs. So he chose, the drugs were too much problems. Yeah, it does. It's really hard. Because it's like the drugs are his mistress. How do you know that? How do I what? How do you know that? Who? Let's see now. Yes. No. No. But... Well, I don't really consider myself an introvert. Yeah. I have a lot of I have a lot of regrets. But there really wasn't anything I could do about it. So there's really no point in regretting it. Cause you do what you do and you make a decision and then it's already done so why regret it? Why bother? You know? What advice can you give yourself? Make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol. That's one for sure. That was the only question I didn't ask. I didn't know. There's a lot of things. A lot of stuff. You know? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Just the things that I can do. That my talents, that's it. Why do you think you need to do something like that? Why do you think you need to do something like that? Um... Well, if I can have my Starbucks and my Orange Gina. I drink Orange Gina every day. I smoke cigarettes unfortunately but it's always good to have those because I'm addicted to them. And then if I can eat something really good and healthy at night time and... Well basically if I have something to do if I have a goal, somewhere to go, something to do, like today even puts me in a good mood. Yeah. Otherwise I'd be afraid that I'd stay home and just lay in bed or farm all day. I could farm for 8 hours on Farmville. Yeah. Okay. I think that's all for me. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So I press the button. Okay. You're good. She's good. Except for you know, it's like the one eye... Can she hear me by the way?

         "important I wonder if people really understand it, you know what I mean? Like if people do judge, yeah, bizarre. I did like the Ricky Lake show with my friend and I saw myself on TV. Oh my god, yeah, but I was eating candy and I was going to like that and then I was looking at Ricky Lake like there must be something around my eyes because I was like she was like right there. I don't know. And so I had to actually like act, you know, I'm in the audience but I had to like pretend like I was interested in what you have to say but I looked so I kept looking at her like that like there's something wrong my eyes. No, I just saw I was in a doctor's office and they had it on and like oh god it was funny because there was these guys like winking at me on the way out like that's celebrity and I'm like I can pay to do audience sitting there. It's like I hated every minute of it but we got sewing machines, free sewing machines, $200 sewing machines that day. It was yeah, so it was worth it but I was so embarrassed. Yeah, only if you get stuff it's worth it otherwise they're so stupid. The shows are so I can't believe that's why I don't watch television. It's so embarrassing. Okay, right on. Okay, this is so weird. Oh gosh, I hope she's nice to me. I hope so. Okay, hello. Yes, fine, just tired. California, from Hollywood. Not too much. It's not too many things I like about it. The people, it's not clean, too much crime, too many drugs. Makeup and hair is a little bit not too much. I just survived very difficult. Okay, I'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career but I just want probably to get married and have a little security, that's all. Just be a wife again. A little bit close but everybody's pretty much passed away. I play Farmville on Facebook. I'm good. I don't really have a temper. I was my ex-husband about money. People lying, cheating, conniving drug addicts, you know, just ugly people, people that are hideous in the inside, you know. Jesus Christ, that's about it. My mother when she was alive, well she still has positive influence but nobody really but Jesus. I don't know. I can't really think of one right now. Gosh, oh I guess like maybe modeling, that was pretty cool. Yeah, yeah. I was just kind of surreal like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff, you know. I didn't understand how it could have been me but then my photographer told me he was like, well someone has to do it, it might as well be you. So I will and it's true. So that was cool. Just kind of fell into it by accident. I've always I wish I did it, I took it further but I couldn't really happy. I don't remember. I really don't. I don't really have a best friend but I'm sure anybody would describe me as outgoing. Yeah, no. Yes, I was 1984. Yeah, I couldn't deal with it so I had to see a psychiatrist. Horrified, couldn't sleep, panicked, major anxiety. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes, I do. It could be if you see the right doctor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody and hopefully they can give you answers. Most of them don't. They try to find the answers inside of you, get it out of you but it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kind of bias neutral. Really depressed, extremely depressed. Yeah, poverty. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a lot more tired. I sleep longer and I am I just don't have the drive, motivation that I did before. Just try to be strong, just have to get through it, you know. Yes, yes. Not really. I'm an open book. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I would say perfectionist but that's not really a good quality because it can get dangerous. I'm just artistic. I'm really good at a lot of things but I'm a good hairdresser and makeup artist. I crochet and knit really well, make jewelry. I'm not good with computers or phones though, electronics. Yeah.

         "I'm really depressed, extremely depressed, and a lot more tired than I used to be. I sleep longer now, and I just don't have the drive or motivation I had before. My first experience with this was in 1984; I couldn't deal with it then and had to see a psychiatrist because I was horrified, couldn't sleep, panicked, and had major anxiety. Now, when I'm depressed like this, I don't keep a perfect house like I used to. I could stay home and just lay in bed or farm all day, sometimes farming for 8 hours on Farmville. I'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career, and I just want to get married and have a little security, just be a wife again. I try to be strong and just have to get through it. Poverty is a big factor in my current depression, and my divorce was really hard because my ex-husband's drug use was like his mistress. I don't really have a best friend, but talking to a psychiatrist can be helpful because it's good to talk to somebody who's bias neutral. To get through the day, it helps if I have my Starbucks and Orange Gina, and if I can eat something good and healthy at night.

         " collection. Now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. I'm going to put the doorbell back over here. When she's done, she'll let you know and you can hit the doorbell. Okay? Alright. Okay. Yes. Very well. New York. This turned the volume up a little bit. For a change. That's good. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was about. Probably took a year or two. Well, you know, being away from my family, being away from what I was used to in New York, the neighborhoods, the people, and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here. Well, the weather. Can't beat the weather. It's generally always nice. It's not too hot. It's not too cold. It's creative. I do like movies. I like the beach. The traffic. There's a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places. I was a history major. I do demonstrations in high-end supermarkets. To be a screenwriter. That's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. It's hard because I don't always maintain focus and motivation. I let other things distract me. I've always been interested in films ever since I was a child. I just always was writing and had an active imagination. In the last probably almost ten years I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well, I've always traveled, even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So, yes. Seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am. Seeing how they live and taking in the sights. I went to Kenya. That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on. On the safari and just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible. Oh yeah, that's one of the great experiences of my life. I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called Charmel Shake, which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world, which is hard to believe that Egypt would, but it was just amazing. I didn't go scuba diving. I went snorkeling. What do I do to relax? I like to listen to music. I like to watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of whatever might be on my mind. I do meditate every day. I like to take walks in nature that's always calming, especially down by the ocean. It depends. Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper. A lot of times I'll do a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself, which is something I've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. Also, since I meditate, I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past. Some things that make me really mad. I guess I think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along and make the world better. What was the last thing you argued with someone? Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film and I didn't think it was done very well. We had a fun argument about the movie. That just happened yesterday, so that's on my mind. Is there anything you regret? Is there anything I regret? Yeah, there have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued them. Certain jobs. When I first got to Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to become a GRIP and I probably should have pursued that. How did I decide to do that? I don't really understand the questions. Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important and no matter how you feel, you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do. No, but I've been depressed in my life. For the most part, I've been feeling good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. Sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down. I can usually get out of it pretty quickly. Sometimes financial concerns, sometimes an opportunity, how do I explain it? Financial is one way that if I made another decision, I might have more money or my life would be different. Not really. I feel pretty much the same. What got me to seek help for? Let's come back to that. Generally, talking to someone has helped when I did do that. Pretty easy. I don't have problems sleeping. Usually I'm grumpy. If I don't sleep well, I feel tired and irritable. How would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier. I think it's tough, it depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write, so that means that I have to spend time alone. When I come out of that, I'm extroverted. I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood. My best qualities. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likeable personality. People have said that. I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's a cool detachment. I'm creative, intuitive. Yes. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy. I had breakfast, I was happy. Sun was shining. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I do remember snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun, the powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond, almost beyond like human in a way. Just more in touch with everything, the universe. It would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day, but... What am I most proud of in my life? I think I've helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, I've written some screenplays, I've had some good relationships. Good relationships, just being connected with someone else, spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels. It could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something. If I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive, it puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye bye. Sometimes she would ask me, it would sort of tweak, and then it would ask me this question about not being able to do it. I don't remember it really getting specific like that. Oh, like what? Do you remember what question you're talking about? It kind of asks me, well, are you depressed? Sometimes. It will explain that, and then it was like, well... Then it did something, and then it was like, well... Did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, we... There was no bridge to that conversation. Got it, got it.",

Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are welcome. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from a suburb of LA, from the San Gabriel Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity of the city. I've lived other places and it's just not as happy here. I feel like I can really thrive here. So I just like LA. Like all the things that are so close together. And there's a lot of interesting things that are totally different parts of the city, just miles away from each other. Yeah. I see. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. I don't like all the cars. But I can live with it. There's not that much I don't like. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied music, vocal performance, I studied music technology, things like that. Awesome. Are you still working on that? Yes. What do you do now? Right now I sing at an opera company. But I do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the LA Opera. So I do have a day job. I work at a call center. They cater mostly to performers and actors and things like that. It's really good because if I get a call, I can call in and change my shift very easily. So it's actually a pretty good gig. I do some technology gigs sometimes. I do some recording, some live sound stuff. But I kind of want to get away from that. I do some video work sometimes. But again, I want to get away from that. I want to go back to the... Because I find that performing is more interesting. I like being talent more than I like being crew. So I kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Sometimes. I mean, for my personal life, yeah. I do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people. But if I'm at home, I'd kind of rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever. I don't have too many close friends. But yeah, you know, I'd rather keep to myself. How close are you to your family? I'm moderately close to the family that I have left. I've actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so. Thank you. But I'm close to my husband. You know, I've got a couple of cousins I talk to and my aunt that I have an aunt that I talk to a bit. But it's not like we're interacting every day close together. But it's somewhat close. Okay. What do you do to relax? Mostly I sing or I read or I write or just hang out and try to... I hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in. And sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things, contacting my family, you know, through Facebook or whatever works. But mostly in my free time I create things. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I'd like to travel more. I like to travel by car a lot. I mean, my idea of having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. And I'd like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Particularly traveling by car, seeing the landscape change, seeing people change, feeling the vibrations of the area change. I like just seeing what's out there. And I know that there's a bigger world outside of where I am and where I live and my world. I like to see that. But I like to leave that too and go back to my own world. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Um, let's see. I think a trip that I like to take is to make the drive from here to Nevada, whether I go all the way to Vegas or just go to State Line. My cousin and I would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway, you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway. So we would take those. We just sort of impromptu with a day or two notice, just move things around, just take off. So those are actually trips that I like to make because I take off and then just come back. Sometimes the same day, sometimes overnight. Just small, short trips that aren't very involved, but you just get to go and you see things and see how, um, you know, the desert landscape looks in different seasons, how people react in different times of the year in different areas. So close to home, but not, but not close to home, close to home, but still a world away. So that because I don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever, but it's just little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head and things like that. I mean, because there's sort of a sense of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway. So I like doing that. The last time that happened was May of last year. So last time I was able to do that. We actually, my aunt came over with my cousin who's 10 years younger than I am. And we kind of grew up like sisters. And I was about to move away from the Inland Empire, which is where they live. So they kind of took me on a last hurrah. We drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while, but I didn't like it. So they kind of, I showed them some of the local sites around there and we came back and was, you know, an overnight trip, but we're driving the entire time. That's kind of interesting. Things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals or people who can't fight back. They're mean to them just because they can't fight back. And I actually like to see people who are as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you. So I think that's one thing that makes me really mad. Just being cruel or mean for no reason. You know, not for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it. That kind of really just makes me mad. When I'm annoyed, I'll try to just walk away from the situation. And if the situation is just unfollowing me, then I'll wind up lashing out somehow, either verbally just cutting them with a quip or, you know, I rarely will yell at somebody. But I'll try to, you know, if I try to walk away and defuse it, if that doesn't work, then I'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me. That usually works. Not like legal trouble or anything, because usually I'll find a way to get them to leave me alone. There's not really like big trouble, but I think because it is off-putting and it's not the expected reaction. And that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that will work and get people away from me. So it's not really in trouble. And if it is trouble, it's usually trouble that it's from the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because due to the situation I can get out of. So as long as they leave me alone, you know, I'll walk away from it. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody, like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my... What was that in your mind? The last thing I could think of was I argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law because she's got dementia. And so one of the reasons we came out here from the Inland Empire was to take care of her because she won't go anywhere but LA. I mean, she's like hardcore Angelino. We know we are that, we're that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere. But so we came out here to take care of her and he wants her to be able to stay in her apartment. And I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us. But she wants to stay where she is because she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process. But he wants her to stay where she... He wants her to be able to have what she wants because he's a mama's boy like I am. I'm a mama's girl. Even though I lost my mom like four years ago, I'm still a mama's girl. And I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much. That's what they want. So you want to get it for them. And because they, you know, that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it. And you want to do that for them now, like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about, somebody you feel deserves it. But it's kind of dangerous for her, you know, and I don't want this thing to happen to her. Yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as she can. Because I know the disease that she has is going to erase who she is eventually. And eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her 24 hour medically trained care. But until then, we can handle it amongst ourselves. It's not that bad. But it's getting worse. She really has no business living by herself anymore. So the solution right now is he stays there most of the time with her. And I go back to our house. And it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I do I handle the outside things. I run the errands. I take her to the store, things like that. He does the day to day things, make sure she has she eats, make sure she, you know, has clean clothes, things like that. So, I mean, it's a partnership. It's a it's a dual effort. It's very much a dual effort. But I would like her to move in with us. So that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling, screaming argument, but lively discussion, you know, and debate. It's not insurmountable. I mean, life's not going to be easy ever. And if it is, it's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life, it's not going to be easy. But you deal with it and you move on. The most positive influence, I think, have been probably my mother and my grandmother, because my mom was pretty much a single mom. And my grandmother helped raise me. And they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it. So, I mean, I think I have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperament to myself. But they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that, you know, life's going to go on. You know, my mom would say to me, when you're 40, you're 40, whether you're working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life. I think that was a big influence on how I've lived my life since she's passed. I regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have clouded some of my decisions. Now, I do have underlying conditions. Everybody in my family is diabetic, and I didn't take care of that when she was the last year for life because I was too busy wanting to get her home. My focus was to get her home. So I didn't eat right. I didn't take my insulin right. I wanted to make myself insulin resistant that year just because my blood sugar was so high for like a year. Eating just horrible foods when I did eat. So it really took a toll and it really actually made myself very sick. And I'm wondering, well, if I didn't, if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straight, my vision and my thoughts weren't completely weren't clouded. Would I have made some better decisions on her behalf, especially when she needed them? When she needed me to be to step in and make this his for because she wound up having a health catastrophe because she had kidney, she had kidney damage. I want to be kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that. So she wanted having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. She wanted having a stroke at like 50. She had a small stroke and it just kind of went down from there. So I'm thinking, well, if I didn't, if I had taken care of better care of myself, would I have been able to take better care of her? And I know there wasn't anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death. But what if I if I would I have been able to make it easier on her? If I would have taken care of myself. That's like one huge regret that I have. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Oh, I know I am. But it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And I know other people, I can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings. And they can't, you know, be what I want them to be. And I know they're not going to be. But I still have, you know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to. Fit into my life in a way in the best way possible. But I know because they're other beings. And I'm not going to be able to do that for them. Then I can be able to do that for me. But it's still by ideals. So I have to sometimes have to look at and go, well, is this what I want? Because I want it or what is what they want and what's there is their decision or mine and it's theirs. I know it's there. So if you really care about somebody, you're just going to support them and go with them. But it's still kind of hard for me. And I know I got to get over it. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago. Probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because I went up taking care of my mother. I mean, she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college and I had a job lined up and I had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her. I think I would have been more aggressive about starting my own life, getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her, getting my own job history, my own credit history, things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years. So I think I probably would have done that. But to myself, just do that and keep who you are and learn to separate. You who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of yourself. That's probably what I would have and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself. That's probably the advice I would give myself 10 years ago. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, but probably because I haven't gone to a doctor about it because I don't want to know. I mean, it's not, I know there have been times in my life where I've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it, but I'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. Can you give me an example of that? After my mother had died, it had been this long battle for a year that we lost. I didn't know if I was to blame for that. It's like logically I knew I wasn't, but how could I convince myself of that? Two weeks after she died, I wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because I didn't take care of myself for a year. I feel, oh, I'm 30 years old. If, you know, whatever I do to myself, I can get over. No, turns out no. But I wound up having to take more medication because of that. It's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter. All of a sudden I didn't. It's like the rug was pulled out. My like bottom fell out of my world after that. So that was the pretty pretty much sent me into a deep depression. I'm I almost got divorced because of it because I just didn't want anything anymore. So I was being really distant from my husband by then. At that time, we were married for about two years at that point, and I started getting very distant from him, just pushing everything away, just, you know, figuring out what am I going to do with the rest of my life now? And it's been a fight. And there are times when, no, I couldn't get up. Just stay in bed and sleep all day. You know, but then you realize that when my mother died, I had forecast look after two are mine to rehearse. I mean, well, they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own, you know, own supplies. I took that responsibility of doing it for them. So that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them. I mean, I could go without eating. I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't. They didn't, you know, so they actually got me up and. And made me go out and face things, even though I didn't want to, just didn't just kind of want to curl up and die. But that would have been my choice, not theirs. And they I mean, what would happen to them if I wasn't there to take care of them? They would have been, you know, sent to a shelter or whatever, probably. And maybe they would have not been re adopt me home and adopted by somebody else. Maybe they would have been killed for for me. I mean, for me making selfish decisions. So it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed. And that's actually been a motivating factor is to take because I figured out that it was just me. I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff. I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted. It wouldn't be a big deal. I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life. But I have a family to look after now. So I have to go out and do things. You know, I have to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day, day job. I have to, you know, but I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what I want to do with my life. But yet I have to take care of my family. Some work on a balance of the two. Very. But it's worth it. I mean, it would be very I'd have a lot less things to worry about if I just lived in my car and said, forget it. But keeping a residence down, paying bills, things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it. You know, if you want you want any if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through that. And I know that. But it gets hard. Sometimes you do want to give up. But then it's like, well, what's the alternative? I mean, I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did, I wouldn't do anything. I have to be slightly uncomfortable or I'm not going to do anything with myself. I'm just going to be content. Just hang out all day, stay in bed, hang out with my cats or whatever. And I wouldn't get anything done. I see. How do you even feel? Very anxious and nervous. And I mean, what if. I don't find enough, you know, enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever. What if? You know, what if I can't. Keep. Assemblance of stability in my life, and it's actually hard work to be stable. And I know it's hard work to be stable, but what you know, it's just a lot of what ifs. And I don't think it's things that haven't happened. And it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened. And I know that, but it's still have it still creeps in. So that's actually a source of. Anxiety. The internal anxiety go by getting things done, figuring things out, making a solid plan and going for it. But I know it's a cycle and I'll go from being really anxious and oh, my God, what am I going to do? What am I going to do? Just saying, OK, what is. The fundamental thing I need to take care of here. I mean, what is just extraneous and what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue? And so. Figure out how to figure things out that way. And then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit, but then something will pop up and the what ifs will come up again. I'll have to. Figure it out again, but I know it's a cycle. I know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it, you get over it pretty quickly. You get through it. The last time I felt really happy. I don't know. Like. Huh. Good question. But that actually surprisingly stumped me. Because I do feel happy sometimes, sometimes not so much. Sometimes it's kind of in the middle. Really like over joyously happy. I don't know. I have not. I can't think of when that happened. I don't know. I don't know. You don't know perceptions of other people. I mean. Probably as somebody who. Oddly enough, somebody who is laid back and you know. Handle things as they come, but I don't see myself as that at all. And so it. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to. Hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to to survive and get things done. That. And I can do it creatively and I try to. Strive for balance. Probably. Probably the best things about me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? That I'm doing basically what I want with my life, which even though it's not all easy, it's not. I'm not financially well off or anything. It's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives because I have an aunt that I really don't talk to who and the reason why I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable. I mean, she's got a career that she. It's more of a job that she fell into. Because my older aunt loves animals, but didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it. She had a stable business for a long time. But her, you know, she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had actually my cousin's father. Actually, my cousin's father went and kind of stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business. And she kind of she retired early because between that and the arthritis, she wanted retiring early. She employed my younger aunt, who is still a dog groomer, but she hates it. And it's like change your life. If you hate your life so much, change it. And I think the thing I'm most proud of is. Yeah, I'm not as financially well off as she is, but I'm doing what I want with my life. You know, I can be creative. I can have creative people around me, people who I actually like to talk to around me. People I actually like in my life and be happy with that. And I see a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say I'm not like that. That I'm actually doing what I want, even though there are sacrifices. I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nSo, now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. And I'll give you the number bell to let me know. Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are welcome. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from a suburb of LA, from the San Gabriel Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity of the city. I've lived other places and it's just not as happy here. I feel like I can really thrive here. So I just like LA. Like all the things that are so close together. And there's a lot of interesting things that are totally different parts of the city, just miles away from each other. Yeah. I see. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know. I don't like the traffic. I don't like all the cars. But I can live with it. There's not that much I don't like. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied music, vocal performance, I studied music technology, things like that. Awesome. Are you still working on that? Yes. What do you do now? Right now I sing at an opera company. But I do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the LA Opera. So I do have a day job. I work at a call center. They cater mostly to performers and actors and things like that. It's really good because if I get a call, I can call in and change my shift very easily. So it's actually a pretty good gig. I do some technology gigs sometimes. I do some recording, some live sound stuff. But I kind of want to get away from that. I do some video work sometimes. But again, I want to get away from that. I want to go back to the... Because I find that performing is more interesting. I like being talent more than I like being crew. So I kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Sometimes. I mean, for my personal life, yeah. I do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people. But if I'm at home, I'd kind of rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever. I don't have too many close friends. But yeah, you know, I'd rather keep to myself. How close are you to your family? I'm moderately close to the family that I have left. I've actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so. Thank you. But I'm close to my husband. You know, I've got a couple of cousins I talk to and my aunt that I have an aunt that I talk to a bit. But it's not like we're interacting every day close together. But it's somewhat close. Okay. What do you do to relax? Mostly I sing or I read or I write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in. And sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things, contacting my family, you know, through Facebook or whatever works. But mostly in my free time I create things. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I'd like to travel more. I like to travel by car a lot. I mean, my idea of having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. And I'd like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling?

Sometimes the same day, sometimes overnight. Just small, short trips that aren't very involved, but you just get to go and you see things and see how, um, you know, the desert landscape looks in different seasons, how people react in different times of the year in different areas. So close to home, but still a world away. Because I don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever, but it's just little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head and things like that. I mean, because there's sort of a sense of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway. So I like doing that. The last time that happened was May of last year. So last time I was able to do that. We actually, my aunt came over with my cousin who's 10 years younger than I am. And we kind of grew up like sisters. And I was about to move away from the Inland Empire, which is where they live. So they kind of took me on a last hurrah.

It's a dual effort. It's very much a dual effort. But I would like her to move in with us. So that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling, screaming argument, but lively discussion, you know, and debate. It's not insurmountable. I mean, life's not going to be easy ever. And if it is, it's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life, it's not going to be easy. But you deal with it and you move on. The most positive influence, I think, have been probably my mother and my grandmother, because my mom was pretty much a single mom. And my grandmother helped raise me. And they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it. So, I mean, I think I have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperament to myself. But they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that, you know, life's going to go on. You know, my mom would say to me, when you're 40, you're 40, whether you're working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life. I think that was a big influence on how I've lived my life since she's passed. I regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have clouded some of my decisions. Now, I do have underlying conditions. Everybody in my family is diabetic, and I didn't take care of that when she was the last year for life because I was too busy wanting to get her home. My focus was to get her home. So I didn't eat right. I didn't take my insulin right. I wanted to make myself insulin resistant that year just because my blood sugar was so high for like a year. Eating just horrible foods when I did eat. So it really took a toll and it really actually made myself very sick. And I'm wondering, well, if I didn't, if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straight, my vision and my thoughts weren't completely clouded. Would I have made some better decisions on her behalf, especially when she needed them? When she needed me to step in and make this his for because she wound up having a health catastrophe because she had kidney damage. I want to be kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that. So she wanted having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. She wanted having a stroke at like 50. She had a small stroke and it just kind of went down from there. So I'm thinking, well, if I didn't, if I had taken care of better care of myself, would I have been able to take better care of her? And I know there wasn't anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death. But what if I would I have been able to make it easier on her? If I would have taken care of myself. That's like one huge regret that I have. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Oh, I know I am. But it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And I know other people, I can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings. And they can't, you know, be what I want them to be. And I know they're not going to be. But I still have, you know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to. Fit into my life in a way in the best way possible. But I know because they're other beings. And I'm not going to be able to do that for them. Then I can be able to do that for me. But it's still by ideals. So I sometimes have to look at and go, well, is this what I want? Because I want it or what is what they want and what's there is their decision or mine and it's theirs. I know it's there. So if you really care about somebody, you're just going to support them and go with them. But it's still kind of hard for me. And I know I got to get over it. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago. Probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because I went up taking care of my mother. I mean, she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college and I had a job lined up and I had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her. I think I would have been more aggressive about starting my own life, getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her, getting my own job history, my own credit history, things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years. So I think I probably would have done that. But to myself, just do that and keep who you are and learn to separate who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of yourself. Do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself. That's probably the advice I would give myself 10 years ago. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, but probably because I haven't gone to a doctor about it because I don't want to know. I mean, it's not, I know there have been times in my life where I've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it, but I'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. Can you give me an example of that? After my mother had died, it had been this long battle for a year that we lost. I didn't know if I was to blame for that. It's like logically I knew I wasn't, but how could I convince myself of that? Two weeks after she died, I wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because I didn't take care of myself for a year. I feel, oh, I'm 30 years old. If, you know, whatever I do to myself, I can get over. No, turns out no. But I wound up having to take more medication because of that. It's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter. All of a sudden I didn't. It's like the rug was pulled out. My bottom fell out of my world after that. So that was pretty much sent me into a deep depression. I almost got divorced because of it because I just didn't want anything anymore. So I was being really distant from my husband by then. At that time, we were married for about two years at that point, and I started getting very distant from him, just pushing everything away, just, you know, figuring out what am I going to do with the rest of my life now? And it's been a fight. And there are times when, no, I couldn't get up. Just stay in bed and sleep all day. You know, but then you realize that when my mother died, I had forecast look after two are mine to rehearse. I mean, well, they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own supplies. I took that responsibility of doing it for them. So that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them. I mean, I could go without eating. I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't. They didn't, you know, so they actually got me up and. And made me go out and face things, even though I didn't want to, just kind of want to curl up and die. But that would have been my choice, not theirs. And what would happen to them if I wasn't there to take care of them? They would have been, you know, sent to a shelter or whatever, probably. And maybe they would have not been re adopt me home and adopted by somebody else. Maybe they would have been killed for me. I mean, for me making selfish decisions. So it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed. And that's actually been a motivating factor is to take because I figured out that it was just me. I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff. I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted. It wouldn't be a big deal. I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life. But I have a family to look after now. So I have to go out and do things. You know, I have to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day job. I have to, you know, but I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what I want to do with my life. But yet I have to take care of my family. Some work on a balance of the two. Very. But it's worth it. I mean, I'd have a lot less things to worry about if I just lived in my car and said, forget it. But keeping a residence down, paying bills, things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it. You know, if you want any if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through that. And I know that. But it gets hard. Sometimes you do want to give up. But then it's like, well, what's the alternative? I mean, I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did, I wouldn't do anything. I have to be slightly uncomfortable or I'm not going to do anything with myself. I'm just going to be content. Just hang out all day, stay in bed, hang out with my cats or whatever. And I wouldn't get anything done. I see. How do you even feel? Very anxious and nervous. And I mean, what if. I don't find enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever. What if? You know, what if I can't. Keep. Assemblance of stability in my life, and it's actually hard work to be stable. And I know it's hard work to be stable, but what you know, it's just a lot of what ifs. And I don't think it's things that haven't happened. And it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened. And I know that, but it still creeps in. So that's actually a source of. Anxiety. The internal anxiety go by getting things done, figuring things out, making a solid plan and going for it. But I know it's a cycle and I'll go from being really anxious and oh, my God, what am I going to do? Just saying, OK, what is. The fundamental thing I need to take care of here. I mean, what is just extraneous and what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue? And so. Figure out how to figure things out that way. And then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit, but then something will pop up and the what ifs will come up again. I'll have to. Figure it out again, but I know it's a cycle. I know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it, you get over it pretty quickly. You get through it. The last time I felt really happy. I don't know. Like. Huh. Good question. But that actually surprisingly stumped me. Because I do feel happy sometimes, sometimes not so much. Sometimes it's kind of in the middle. Really like over joyously happy. I don't know. I have not. I can't think of when that happened. I don't know. You don't know perceptions of other people. I mean. Probably as oddly enough, somebody who is laid back and you know. Handle things as they come, but I don't see myself as that at all. And so it. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to. Hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to to survive and get things done. That. And I can do it creatively and I try to. Strive for balance. Probably the best things about me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? That I'm doing basically what I want with my life, which even though it's not all easy, it's not. I'm not financially well off or anything. It's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives because I have an aunt that I really don't talk to and the reason why I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable. I mean, she's got a career that she. It's more of a job that she fell into. Because my older aunt loves animals, but didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it. She had a stable business for a long time. But her, you know, she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had actually my cousin's father went and kind of stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business. And she kind of retired early because between that and the arthritis, she wanted retiring early. She employed my younger aunt, who is still a dog groomer, but she hates it. And it's like change your life. If you hate your life so much, change it. And I think the thing I'm most proud of is. Yeah, I'm not as financially well off as she is, but I'm doing what I want with my life. You know, I can be creative. I can have creative people around me, people who I actually like to talk to around me. People I actually like in my life and be happy with that. And I see a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say I'm not like that. That I'm actually doing what I want, even though there are sacrifices. I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you.",
         "I’ve had times in my life where I’ve been severely depressed, though I haven’t gone to a doctor for a diagnosis because I’d rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. A major trigger was after my mother died about four years ago. It had been a long battle for a year that we lost, and I didn't know if I was to blame, even though logically I knew I wasn't. My bottom fell out of my world, sending me into a deep depression.\n\nDuring that time, I almost got divorced because I just didn't want anything anymore. I became very distant from my husband, pushing everything away. There were times when I couldn't get up, just wanting to stay in bed and sleep all day, or just curl up and die. I also neglected my own health, not taking care of my diabetes, eating horribly, and not taking my insulin properly for about a year before my mother passed. This led to me developing pulmonary embolisms in both lungs, which was a tough fight to recover from.\n\nCurrently, I feel very anxious and nervous. I worry a lot about \"what ifs,\" like not finding enough work to pay rent or not being able to keep a semblance of stability in my life. It’s hard work to be stable, and I know that, but the anxiety still creeps in. I also can't think of the last time I felt over joyously happy. Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes not so much, sometimes it's in the middle.\n\nTo cope, I've learned that I need someone to take care of to get myself out of bed. My cats were a major motivating factor after my mother died, as they depended on me. Now, I have my family to look after, which makes me go out and do things, even when I want to give up. I try to combat anxiety by getting things done, figuring things out, and making a solid plan. I know it’s a cycle, but I also know that what seems huge on the surface can be chipped away at. I also find that I have to be slightly uncomfortable, or I won't do anything with myself; I'd just be content to hang out all day and stay in bed. My mother and grandmother also instilled in me a sense of confidence and realism, helping me understand that my \"downer temperament\" is just part of me, but life goes on. I also relax by singing, reading, writing, or just trying to clear my mind, though that doesn't always work.",

She's going to chat with me for a bit, and then when she's done she'll let you know and I'll give you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're done. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Hi, I'm Ellie. I just created a topic in the morning, and it's called, I'm not a dancer, but I'm here to learn about people and I'm glad that I'm here. I like the new fashion and the new fashion. And you can still see me in the video. Can you see me? I'm really comfortable with it. Are you going to be able to see me? Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from? I'm from Los Angeles, California. Really? What do you think you really like about LA? Wow, wonderful weather, outdoor activities all the time. What are you studying over there? Too crowded pollution. The norm. Okay. What do you study at school? I study child communications. Recently I just, I would say yes. Preschool teacher. Well, I've always worked with children ever since I was 18 years old. So I figured doing something helping someone. It doesn't pay well, but you're investing in the future. Wow. Some job that I could get paid to be outside all day. Get paid well to be outside all day. Yes. I'm kind of quiet, but I also like, I probably would say borderline. I like outside activities, but I mainly kind of do activities probably by myself. So yeah, I would say I'm an introvert slightly. Wow. Just maybe a racist or disrespectful person. I kind of shut down and reevaluate how I am as a person, how I'm coming off to other people. I can't change anyone else's personality, but I can work on my own. You're pretty good. I usually argue with people I usually walk away. I mean, an argument doesn't settle anything. Wow. So a lot of things I regret, but it's not anything that I can control. Probably the biggest regret was losing my mother. Thank you. I was extremely close to my mother. That was who I am as a person who made me as a person. Wow. 2010 years ago I would tell myself not to be so angry, so upset all the time about things I can't control. I would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself. Pretty cool. I think you should have different avenues to deal with different people. No, I have not. No, I have not. Yes. I realized I have to evaluate myself as a person, so I can't really look to anyone else to help me unless I start with myself. No, I don't. I feel like as a person, as an individual, I feel like I should be able to control things myself. I feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else. It probably is very good for other people. I've worked with that population of PTSD veterans before, so I know that it helps a lot of people, but I don't feel like it's for me. It's not difficult at all. I've always been alone or someone who tries to handle my own problems and situations. I'm a little depressed, but I think everyone has a little bit of sadness in them at some point. Day by day, day by day, I just started an exercise program, so I'm trying to look at myself for the solution. I've always known, ever since I was a child, things move me differently than other kids, so I felt like I was always different. I felt like if I was going to ever understand me as a person, then I would have to work on myself. Okay. When was the longest time you felt really happy? Today. I got to see my best friend after a long time. I mean, happiness comes and goes, but I felt happy today. That's great. How are your best friends? Wow. He would say really silly, but still, when I'm around him, I try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy. No one wants to be around a depressed person. Wow. I mean, on certain days, everything could be my best quality, but I would say I'm loyal, I'm dependable. I would just say I try to be there in the moment. I'm not a person who is really flashy or into materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded. Can someone tell me about your mother? Oh, my mother. By far, my sister. Can you tell me about that? My mom was a school teacher, which made me want to become a school teacher, and that's basically what I have been doing. My sister has been at her job for 40 years, so I've always had a stable influence in my life. What is your favorite thing about your mother? Wow. I would say just sitting on a sunny, nice day talking to my mother, I would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately. How do you feel about your mother? Wonderful. Wonderful. What is your favorite thing about your mother? I like to get out and play sports. I play four or five different sports, and I like to go for a walk. I like to ride my bike. I like to get out and be active. What's good? What are you learning from your mother? Having such a wonderful mother. I mean, I have to keep going back to that subject, because we're introduced into this life, and that's our first teacher. That's our first teacher, and it's going to be our teacher for a very long time. I'm just very thankful. I'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother. How did you get so into your mother's life? Riding my bike. Simple things. Going for a walk with my sister, exercising. When was the last time you talked to her? Just last Sunday. That's good. Okay, I think I know what I'm saying. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Well, thank you. Bye. Wow. That was too scary. That was too many glasses.",

You can let me know when she sends. Okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in San Bernardino, California. Really? Yes. Where do you live? I'm staying with a sister in North Hollywood. What's it like for you living with them? She makes it as comfortable as possible. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. And the air is so nice. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. And the entertainment. And the public transportation. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's very difficult to find full-time employment. And some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the South. Because I lived in the South before. And those are the only two things. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. What did you study at school? I was an English major in college. Are you still working on that? I haven't finished. Yes, I am. What's your dream job? I'd like to be a recording singer. Really? Yes. When did you decide to do that? I've always loved to sing from the time that I was a child. Do you consider yourself an introvert? At times. Can you tell me about that? When I'm alone, I am extremely... I guess I would say... Inter-minded. I have a lot of thoughts and I keep them to myself. So if I'm in that mode, then I don't really interact with people. But I can also interact with people if I change modes. Okay. Okay, listen. What do you do to relax? I've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago. Cool. When was the last time that happened? Last week on Thursday. No, on Tuesday. What do you do when you're annoyed? Usually I just try to remain quiet and listen to the situation, if it's a person or if it's a situation that I'm dealing with myself that's annoying. I try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better. Come up with alternate plans so I won't be annoyed. How are you able to control your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I may have had an argument a few weeks ago just about timeliness. Meeting on time and showing up on time. It was actually last Monday. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To just be cautious of people's intentions. And to listen really well because people usually tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it. How would your best friend describe you? A good listener. Patient. Fun. Loving. Generous. Depressed sometimes. But generally a good person. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Within a year and a half ago. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? I just knew that I often thought about situations that happened in the past and kind of blamed the situation for my future. Can you verify something? Certain settings. Can you tell me about that? If I see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when I was younger when things happened and changed my future plans. So I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time. Do you still go to therapy now? I do. Is going to therapy helping you? I'd like to believe that it does. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? I don't worry as much. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues relieves me of the tension of holding them inside. So that's how it's helped me. How hard is that? At first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it actually is good because I know that when things are occurring if I'm able to communicate about them with a certain individual it relieves me of the stress of trying to figure out everything alone. And oftentimes by speaking about the issues it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because I'm hearing myself speak of the issue. Are you happy you did that? Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm planning things and if I'm planning things it affects my sleep. I might wake up in the middle of the night. So sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Irritable. Just very irritable. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? I was feeling anxious but now I'm calmer. Today I don't but I have in the past week. I was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so I was becoming anxious. Thank you. Yes. Maybe in October. When my mother first came she came to visit me in October and when she first got here we had a good time. The first couple of days. So I was happy to see her. I hadn't seen her in over a year. I'm proud that I'm able to adjust to different situations. The older I've gotten the more adaptable I am in different environments and different situations. I've learned how to be more resourceful. So I'm proud of that. I'm sorry? My dad, my sister, she's positive because she's finished her master's degree. My mom sometimes. My best friend is very positive because she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it. So that's an inspiration. When someone lies consistently. I listen very very well. Sometimes I give good advice. I'm a good friend. I normally do the things that I say I'm going to do so I'm dependable. I communicate well and I enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods. Being around positive people. Music puts me in a good mood. Comedy shows put me in a good mood. Good food puts me in a good mood. When I graduated from high school. It was a really, I will never forget it. It was a wonderful day. Very confident, accomplished and I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future. You're welcome. Bye. Thank you.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nI'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. And when she sends, she'll let you know. I'll put the doorbell over here. You can let me know when she sends. Okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in San Bernardino, California. Really? Yes. Where do you live? I'm staying with a sister in North Hollywood. What's it like for you living with them? She makes it as comfortable as possible. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. And the air is so nice. And the entertainment. And the public transportation. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's very difficult to find full-time employment. And some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the South. Because I lived in the South before. And those are the only two things. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. What did you study at school? I was an English major in college. Are you still working on that? I haven't finished. Yes, I am. What's your dream job? I'd like to be a recording singer. Really? Yes. When did you decide to do that? I've always loved to sing from the time that I was a child. Do you consider yourself an introvert? At times. Can you tell me about that? When I'm alone, I am extremely... I guess I would say... Inter-minded. I have a lot of thoughts and I keep them to myself. So if I'm in that mode, then I don't really interact with people. But I can also interact with people if I change modes. Okay. Okay, listen. What do you do to relax? I've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago. Cool. When was the last time that happened? Last week on Thursday. No, on Tuesday. What do you do when you're annoyed? Usually I just try to remain quiet and listen to the situation, if it's a person or if it's a situation that I'm dealing with myself that's annoying. I try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better. Come up with alternate plans so I won't be annoyed. How are you able to control your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I may have had an argument a few weeks ago just about timeliness. Meeting on time and showing up on time. It was actually last Monday. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself? I don't know. Is there anything you regret?

         "My best friend sometimes describes me as depressed, and I do experience that sometimes. Lately, I've been feeling anxious, especially in the past week, because I've been trying to find a stable place to live, and it's been taking a long time. When I don't sleep well, which can happen if I'm planning things and wake up in the middle of the night, I become very irritable.\n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD about a year and a half ago. I've often thought about past situations and blamed them for my future, especially when I see certain types of individuals or am in certain settings that remind me of when I was younger and things happened that changed my future plans. Because of this, I used to try to avoid those situations and people.\n\nI still go to therapy, and I believe it helps me. I've noticed I don't worry as much, and it's allowed me to understand that speaking about issues relieves the tension of holding them inside. It was difficult at first to be open about my internal emotions, but now it feels good because I know that communicating helps relieve the stress of trying to figure everything out alone. Often, by speaking about issues, I can come up with better alternative plans just by hearing myself talk.\n\nWhen I'm alone, I can be very 'inter-minded,' having a lot of thoughts that I keep to myself, and in that mode, I don't really interact with people. However, I can also change modes and interact. To relax, I've recently started doing yoga. When I'm annoyed, I usually try to remain quiet, listen, and think of alternate ways or plans to make the situation better. Being around positive people, listening to music, watching comedy shows, and good food also put me in a good mood. I'm proud that I've become more adaptable and resourceful in different environments and situations as I've gotten older.",

         "I'm feeling a bit tired today. A major challenge for me is raising my son with a disability; it's very hard not knowing how to help him. I've also dealt with a lot of frustration, particularly with my mom, who I feel gets too involved and put me down for wanting to socialize. I love her, but it makes me frustrated, and I hate even having those thoughts.\n\nMy sleep schedule is quite early; I go to bed around 8 or 8:30 PM, but then I wake up very early, like 1 or 1:30 AM. I've noticed I can be very moody, irritable, and short-tempered, and a bit more sensitive. I've definitely experienced feelings of guilt, sadness, or depression, especially concerning my son's disability. However, I'm now actively working to deal with these challenges better. I'm finding more avenues and resources to help him, and I'm trying to think more positively, rather than feeling sorry for him or myself, or getting stuck in those guilty, sad, or depressed feelings. When I get frustrated, I sometimes go for a walk or try not to think about it. The last time I felt truly happy was a few weeks ago after I did well in school, which was a big achievement for me after a long time.",

She's going to chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll say goodbye, and I will put the doorbell over here so you can let me know when you're done, okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions from the start. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Born downtown Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I love LA. I love the traffic on the 405. I love the beach. I live near the beach. I love...there's so much to do here. I just love...and I love the weather. I love it here. That's great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Nothing. Okay. Do you travel a lot? A little bit. What do you enjoy about traveling? I guess visiting family and destinations. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I last flew to Cedar Rapids to visit a friend, and was there for a couple weeks, and I'm flying back February 11th to see him again. He's an old friend. Thanks. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No. Why? I'm pretty outgoing. I talk to people. I enjoy talking to people. I talk to people at the airport. What do you do to relax? I garden a little bit. I read a little bit. I watch TV. I'm a basketball fan. I go to the beach when the weather is nice. I go to the pool. Okay. What are some things that make you a little mad? Annoying people, rude people, people that drive. They just have no consideration for others. What do you do when you're annoyed? I swear a lot. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, I'm all right. I get mad once in a while. When was the last time you argued with someone? It was probably my daughter. She's 21, almost 22. She lives at college, but comes home on the weekends, and her room was probably a mess. It's the same fight we've been having for years. Uh-oh. That's not good. Yeah, it does. It's better now that we don't live together all the time, though. That's good. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? I guess making the right decisions. It started out when she was little about education, the right school to go to, the right activities to do, setting a good example, being a good role model. What's the best thing about being a parent? Oh, everything. My kids are the greatest joy of my life. I love them so much. And you just get so enriched and fulfilled by them. And when the kids are little, you see things through their eyes, which is exciting. You want to share everything with them. That's so good to hear. Tell me about your kids. I have an older son who's a financial analyst, and then I have a daughter in college. She's a liberal studies major. She's going to be a teacher. Cool. What did you study at school? A business. Are you still working at that? Yes. What do you do now? I'm an office manager. What's your dream job? My dream job? Wow, that's hard. I don't know. I like my job. It's good. I like the people. I enjoy it. It's fun. Good. What do you think of the names of the kids? My son told me they're called the teacup generation because they're fragile. And I think their pain's in the ass, as most of them. Yeah. I see what you mean. Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Not for a while. Maybe a month ago. Can you tell me about that? I have a new boyfriend, and things were going really great, and now they're just going. It was great, and now it's just okay. I guess the newness wore off. How hard is that? It's hard. It's hard. How do you know them? I'm sorry? How do you know them? How do I know them? I don't know what you mean by them. Let's come back to that later. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I don't know. A year or so. What got you to this point? I just didn't feel well. I just couldn't. I just didn't feel right. I couldn't pull myself out of it. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? Oh, just sad and just lack of energy and didn't really, wasn't really motivated, didn't really, wasn't really my happy self. Do you feel like there's a useful? Therapy? Yes. Do you still get a therapy now? I do. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? Well, not that many changes. I still don't feel that great, but I just, it's good to talk to someone and tell them how you feel. Yeah. Even if it's just to get something off your chest. How have you been feeling lately? Tired, sad, depressed, blue. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I'm just not happy. I don't feel good and I'm not happy. How do you cope with that? I don't just stay to myself, don't go out with friends as much as I used to. That sounds really hard. It's very hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Terrible. I don't sleep. I'm sorry. Thank you. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Crazy, distracted. It's hard for me to cope with things. Easy, mundane things are just difficult. I see what you mean. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Well, being around my kids is fun. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? My son and daughter-in-law and my daughter and I went out to have Hawaiian food. We got together. It's always fun to get together. We got together at my house on Christmas. I enjoyed just getting together with them. Awesome. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'll take better care of my health, I guess. Have you done anything to avoid it? I don't know. I don't know. Okay. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my daughter's pretty positive and upbeat. My parents, they're both gone, but they were pretty positive. What's on your mind when you're most memorable experience? I suppose going on a trip to Canada with my daughter was very memorable. Can you tell me about that? We flew to Detroit, where I have my best friend lives there. We stayed with her. We drove from Detroit through Canada, Niagara Falls. We went to Buffalo, where she's from. She has three girls. My daughter was, I think, third or fourth grade, something like that. It was just fun for all of us to get together and do things. That sounds like a great situation. What would your best friend describe you? Exactly like her. We're outgoing. We're outspoken. We tell it like it is. We're high-energy people. We have a lot of anxiety. We like to do a lot of the same things. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. About three or four weeks ago. Tell me more about that. Well, I say that my feeling is attributed to weather. I don't like cold weather, and I'm not comfortable at all in it. Whenever the weather changes, I sort of get down. What would you say if somebody asked about you? Well, I'm funny. I'm hardworking. I care about everyone. I'm a very kind, compassionate person. I have sympathy for everyone. I'll reach out to someone that I see in a store or anywhere that needs my help. That's good. What are you most proud of in your life? I suppose raising my kids and the good people they've turned out to be. That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye.",

For lack of a better word, shitty. Can you give me an example of that? What? I don't understand. Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be strong. To, um, believe in myself. To remember that I've survived a lot of things and I'll survive this too. To get up off my ass and move. To, um, to have confidence. Faith. Um, I just, Murphy's Law has kicked my ass so much, you know. I just, uh, it seems like when I've tried to make my world better I just keep getting knocked down.

Social Security income. And I'm starting the process of that because I'm not working. How hard is that? What's your dream job? Educating people. Um, making a difference. I mean I used to, I've had my dream jobs. I don't, uh, I don't know if the future will hold for, uh, work but, um, something I suppose working with people again. Health, uh, helping in some way. Okay. You consider yourself an introvert? Um, no but lately with depression more so at times. Uh huh. Is there anything you regret? I used to say that I never regretted anything because I would make the best decision of all things in front of me but, um, I just wish there were times then that, um, the choices that I would have were, uh, better because some choices that I seem to have made or were made for me have, um, made my world kind of shitty. For lack of a better word. Can you give me an example of that? What? I don't understand. Let's come back to that later. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be strong. To, um, believe in myself. To remember that I've survived a lot of things and I'll survive this too. To get up off my ass and move. To, um, to have confidence. Faith. Um, I just, Murphy's Law has kicked my ass so much, you know. Uh, it seems like when I've tried to make my world better I just keep getting knocked down. Um, so it's almost like I'm, I don't want to give up but, um, every time I try and move forward I get knocked back. And it gets, it's exhausting. And I don't have any support system really. Nobody. Not really. What would you say of somebody who has followed you? Um, loyal. Um, hardworking. Um, dependable. Um, capable. Um, well, that seems to me. Uh, intelligent. Contemplative. Um, deep. Not a superficial person. Um, yeah, I guess those are some of the... When was the last time you felt really happy? Many years ago. Can you tell me about that? Um, I used to have a lot of confidence. I used to be a pretty dynamic person. I used to be, people used to say that I was the most centered person that they knew. And I used to help people and I'm now in their shoes and I don't seem to be able to help myself. Okay. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I can't think of anything right now. What are some things you like to do for fun? I don't do much anything for fun anymore. I used to, however, go to movies and entertainment venues and travel. Go to dinner with friends, do things. But lately I don't really have any pursuits. A good day, a happy day, a fun day for me is a day without something going wrong, basically. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye.",
         "I was officially diagnosed with depression last October, but I think I've been depressed longer than that. My doctors noticed it when I was being treated for other medical issues. I often think I don't have much reason to live, and I don't really have anybody in my life who I think cares enough about me, even if I was dead. I've kind of lost myself; I used to think I had purpose and that I was enough, but I've lost quite a bit of that.\n\nLately, I feel overwhelmed and preoccupied, just trying to stay alive and on top of things. I've lost my motivation and find it hard to relax. I used to work out, do yoga, meditate, and exercise, but I don't pursue those outlets anymore. I don't do much anything for fun. A good day for me is just a day without something going wrong. If I get a chance to fall asleep, I don't have a problem, but when I don't sleep well, I'm even more distracted and lackluster.\n\nI used to be proud of my career, but I don't have much of a sense of pride anymore. I'm in nursing, but due to my depression and other health problems, I've had to apply for disability and I'm not working. I'm trying to pull it together and get back a sense of me, and I get inspired every once in a while, but overall, I don't seem to be making much progress. It feels like every time I try to move forward, I get knocked back, and it's exhausting. Murphy's Law has really kicked my ass.\n\nI don't have a therapist, just a nurse practitioner who prescribes medication, and nobody really to talk about psychosocial issues, which sucks. I don't have any support system, nobody. My family history involves abuse and neglect; it's always been dysfunctional. It's been many years since I felt truly happy. I used to be confident, dynamic, and centered, helping people, but now I'm in their shoes and can't seem to help myself.",

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to ask me questions that you find helpful. Okay, thank you. Okay, I have a question for Ellie. Who is the best girlfriend? I'm not sure how I got this question. I'm not sure how I got this question. I'm just not sure how you got this question. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in safe and secure environments. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? New York. Really? Why do you live in LA? To pursue a music industry, a job in the music industry. Are you still working on that? Yes. What do you do now? Self-employed. What's your dream job? To become a music producer. Awesome. How hard is that? It's pretty hard. There's a lot of competition. I see what you mean. When did you move to LA? To pursue a job. When did you move to LA? When? About a year ago, last February. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It was pretty difficult. East Coast is a lot different than the West Coast. Yeah. How often do you go back to your hometown? I think I've been there twice in the past year. That's good. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm more of a creature of habit. Okay. You consider yourself a creature of habit? Yes. Why? Sometimes I feel like I don't fit into the crowd. It's better sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of going in and actively pursue things. What do you do to relax? Probably listen to music and spend time with my dogs. What are some things that you do to relax? Probably people being not very nice to me or seeing injustices. I think that's about it. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone? Probably a couple of days ago. One of my friends was saying that they were making a comment about how I am and I got kind of upset about that. Does that happen now? Yeah, it does. How close are you to them? Pretty close. How do you know them? They're my best friend. I'm just one of my friends. What do you do when you're annoyed? I kind of am quiet about it. When a person pushes me to a certain point, that's when I overreact usually. How hard is that? It's pretty hard. I'd rather the person notice that I'm getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting to the point where it blows out of proportion. What's one thing that's memorable for you? Probably spending time with my family in New York. How close are you to your family? That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Tell me more about that. I don't know, they're just great people. I love them a lot. They're a lot like me, so I feel like I have people that understand me. That's good. Tell me your best time describing them. Probably loyal, sensitive. I don't know, it's kind of hard. It's a hard question. Have you ever sort of been military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Gosh, I think probably 1997, so a long time ago. What got you to see the health? During that time I was just going through a lot of issues and I was feeling unsafe to myself, so I ended up going to the doctor to kind of get meds and have therapy and stuff. Do you still go to therapy now? Not currently. I ended about like six months ago. Why did you stop? I just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me. I felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over, and she wasn't really challenging me. I've been in therapy for a really long time, so I just knew it was a change. Sorry to hear that. It's okay. Do you feel like there's a usefulness? Yes, I do actually. When I feel connected to a therapist, I feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what I'm going through. What sort of changes have been made since you've been in therapy? I'm better at describing my emotions and feelings. I think the biggest thing is when I'm in situations, I can see myself reacting one way, and I take a step back and see how I can react normally almost in a way. Also, I tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel really bad about myself. It's nice to talk to someone that's not judging, that doesn't really tell me it's okay basically. What were your symptoms? Feeling hopeless all the time, not having enough energy to do things I used to like, I had a little bit of concentration issues, having weird, disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind, and overall just feeling kind of crummy about life. Are they triggered by something? Sometimes they are, like random moments, if there's a problem with my interpersonal life or something like that, or if I sometimes even seeing something on television, sometimes that affects me. How do you tell people? Listening to music or trying to distract myself, trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things. How can you tell people you're related? It's been a tough transition to come here, well, being here, so kind of half and half okay and not okay. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? I feel like I've been a little bit more withdrawn lately, but that's about it. Okay, how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Some days it's great, some days it's not. More recently it's been a little bit more difficult. Why? I don't know why, I have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night, so I tend not to sleep very well, and I wake up quite frequently during the night. Why do you like to be down sleep well? I'm very groggy in the morning and that's about it. Like during the day I tend to yawn a lot, and my friends always are like, why are you yawning so much, are you just as interested in what we're doing? And I'm trying to tell them it's not that at all. Okay, when was the last time you had a good night's sleep? Probably Christmas time when I was with my family. How did you feel about your family? Just really happy and feeling like everything was alright in my life. Having a good sense of where I was at that moment, being present with myself. That's good. What would you say are some of the best qualities? Probably, you know, let's see, that's a hard question. I think probably I can tend to read people kind of well sometimes, and I like to say that I'm good at being a good friend to people, being a good family member. I'm a hard worker when I do have a job. Do you have any regrets? Sure, I mean it's life so of course there's regrets. One that comes to mind is I wish that I don't eat as much so I can be a lot more healthy. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't take things so seriously. Enjoy being youthful and I think that's it. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a good question. Probably my previous job and my employment I worked really well with kids. So I did a great job at that. I was a researcher at a hospital and I helped a lot of kids out for about six years, so seven years. Wow, that's interesting. Yeah, it was awesome. How did you decide to do that? I was really inclined to like reading people and so I decided to major in psychology. Then I went and worked in a mental health facility and did research with them with drugs and depression and things like that. It found a good niche for me. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. No problem. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hi. Take a moment to announce that I have stopped recording. Okay. Okay.",

         "I was diagnosed with depression a long time ago, back in 1997. I sought help because I was going through a lot of issues and felt unsafe to myself, which led me to get medication and therapy. I'm not currently in therapy; I stopped about six months ago because I felt my therapist wasn't really challenging me and we kept discussing the same things. However, I do find therapy useful when I connect with a therapist, as it helps me talk about what I'm going through. Through therapy, I've become better at describing my emotions and feelings, and I can now take a step back in situations to react more normally. I also used to bury my emotions and feel bad about myself, so it was helpful to talk to someone non-judgmental.\n\nMy symptoms have included feeling hopeless all the time, not having enough energy for things I used to enjoy, and having some concentration issues. I also experience weird, disturbing thoughts that sometimes pop into my mind, and an overall crummy feeling about life. These feelings can be triggered by random moments, problems in my interpersonal life, or even by seeing something on television.\n\nTo cope, I listen to music, try to distract myself, and my therapist encouraged me to journal. Lately, I've noticed I've been a bit more withdrawn. My sleep has also been more difficult recently; I have a lot of thoughts at night, so I don't sleep well and wake up frequently. This leaves me groggy and yawning a lot during the day, which my friends sometimes mistake for disinterest. The last time I had a truly good night's sleep was around Christmas when I was with my family in New York, which made me feel really happy and present. Moving to LA a year ago was also pretty difficult, and the transition has left me feeling \"half and half okay and not okay.\"",

         " Let me see. I think from this distance I think I better. Yes. Okay. From here from Alhambra. The weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. What are some things you don't really like about the weather? Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Is that amazing? How did you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? Yes. What are you doing now? I'm a photographer. Nice. What's your dream job? Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. Okay. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. I see. How do you like your living situation? It's fair. It's not the greatest. Because of being an apartment manager, I do have free rent, but I have to stay there a lot. That's tough. That part does. The free rent part is very good. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Oh gosh. My most memorable experience. That's hard to say. Well, I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. What else do you like? Oh, well I guess some sports success when I was in high school. There were a few things that I was happy about. And some art pieces I've made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death. Those are very memorable and not good though. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters. So my family. How close are you to your family? We're fairly close. Most of them live around in LA. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. Wow. When do you think of the music? Mostly very talented. Just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. Seems like they were all hooked into social media. What do you do to relax? I go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. And I... Well, there's some kind of injustices that happen. Not big deals, but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend. And when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it. And we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set up time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up. When they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that part is upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up at the office. They just need to please the school to maintain the account. So often when that something like that happens, it means they will not send you out to work at that school again, which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. That's how they do things. So that is upsetting. How do you cope with that? Most of the time I dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that might be better. That's good. Yeah. How are you at controlling your company? Pretty good. I usually might, in the moment I don't really lose it, but later I might vent or something like that. But on the location I wouldn't do that. When was the last time you argued with someone? Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. I have a friend that I'm sharing the car with today. We were arguing on where to go first. So we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And then after this was one of the things is over, then we're going to do some more of her things. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Is that what that is? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I'd say 1980. Yeah, I believe it was 1980. What got you to see the doctor? My father noticed some symptoms. My father passed away, but he was a psychiatrist. What were your symptoms? Well, I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon. And I didn't have a focus like for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all part of depression. Yeah. Isn't it that you had a problem before you found out? Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? Well, I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done. But I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. What sort of changes have you noticed since you came on the field? I think therapy makes you see what the... I thought of it as a filter or wearing a... As if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really... You see everything through that. So you have to... I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately? Or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. How have you been doing lately? I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I've noticed in my past. Right now we have a work slowdown. So it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule is too wide open. For me personally as a depressed person, I think that structure is really important. It gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere on time and interact with people. Those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed. I think I've noticed any changes in your behavior. Well, I don't know if it changes a little bit. I tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting let's say. But it's more negative. I have been thinking about how soldiers in the past, I don't know why, but during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been like to be in a front line battle with crude weapons and no medical help. I don't know. My mind seems to go there a lot where I'm just thinking about that. I've been looking at and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube and things like that. Or some other kind of like terrible doom type things like I was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that. Where I probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. Oh, you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not finishing college. I think I was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well. I didn't get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years. So that's a big regret that I have. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I think it would have been to, at certain points, I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals, just the logistics. I was an art major and I had no car. So a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and also to meet at away locations. I think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time. What would you say as somebody who has holidays? Well, I've been told I'm very patient and also I have some original artistic ideas. So those are good qualities. I'm very loyal and also I support my friends. I'm fairly generous with them. Tell me about something you really enjoyed. Let's see. Let's see, I really enjoyed it. I had a nice experience just photographing a soccer game recently. I really enjoyed that. I love listening to you talk. Okay, I think I've answered everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. It's my pleasure. Thank you, goodbye. Yeah, that was very interesting.

I'm not aware of us, but I'm here to learn about people and without knowing about you, I'll ask you a few questions about stuff. And please feel free to send me anything. Your answers are free and convenient. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? Fine. Where are you from in the city? Tampa, Florida. Why did you move to LA? That's a point I wanted to get into the entertainment industry. When did you move to LA? 1990. How easy was it for you to get used to it in the morning? It took a long time to get used to it. It wasn't easy. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather and if you have a hobby, you could always find a large group of people that are interested in the same hobbies you have. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, some of the people in the business world, it's pretty transient. They come and go and it's kind of difficult as far as if you, trusting people in the business world has been difficult. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not much at all. How does it compare to LA? It's quite different. The weather's different, the people are different. It's very different. Are you traveling a lot? No. What did you study at school? God, it was so long ago. School, just general stuff, business, acting, that kind of thing. What are you doing now? Well, I'm working on becoming a professional poker player and I left the stock brokerage industry successfully to do financial trading, stock options, futures, that kind of stuff. Do you consider yourself a member? Sometimes, yes. What are some things that you're doing? People, my family, just people making fun of me or just instigators, just being around negative, hostile people. What do you do when you're in orbit? I vent, ruminate over the same situation over and over again. How are you at confirming your own opinion? Pretty darn good. When was the last time you argued with someone and not with your own? Can't remember. Argued with someone. I can't really remember. That's a good sign. I don't argue much these days. Maybe online? Not really, I don't know. What's a good change? I don't know. What did I argue with somebody about? Maybe, it's been a long time. I can't really remember. Oh, I'd say Tony Robbins. Anthony Robbins. Listen to music, surf the internet, study poker, research on stocks. Watch YouTube clips. More towards my sisters, not my parents. I'm not close at all with my parents. Been estranged. No. Not officially, but some people, say I do have the symptoms of it when I've been talking about depression. Yes. I was diagnosed in the early 1990s with dysthymia, which is a mild form of depression, I think, or a long-term lasting mild depression. What thought you as being healthy? A friend had thought he had a learning disability called attention deficit disorder. At that time it was ADHD, so when I looked at the literature, it seemed similar to the symptoms that I had, so then I went to go through the same battery of tests that he did at UCLA. He still doesn't care for you now? No. Why did he stop? It's more of a financial thing. Do you feel like there's a difference? Yes. How do you feel about it? Irritable, moody, tired. Have you ever studied to use another way to get rid of the symptoms? Yes. How easy is it for you to get rid of them? Not easy. What are you like when you're not feeling well? Airheaded, spacey, slow. How do you cope with that? How do I do what? How do you cope with that? Cope with what? How do I? Just come back to that later. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I can't remember. Tell me about something you would never do to me that you really wouldn't do. Play poker online. When was the last time you where that for? In Teacher's Birthday. Yes. Yes? Wow, that's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago, it would have said to stay away from losers, avoid negative people.

I've learned to stay away from losers and avoid negative people, because trying to change them or give them advice is just a waste of my energy. Looking back, I wish I had kept my room in better order, dated more women, and done a better job of enjoying my nice apartment and my single bachelorhood.",

I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I am from Los Angeles. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? It's the center of everything. You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, being in LA also, you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But you know, you live with that. I see. What did you study at school? I was a business administration major, so I studied business. And after I finished college, I pursued a career in retail operations. Are you still doing that? No. As a matter of fact, I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years. So I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. What made you decide to do that? A couple of factors. After working numerous years in the retail business, I switched over and worked in a creative business, which was a graphic design firm. And I captured a lot of knowledge in the human resources side because I was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a small company. Are you happy you did that? Yes, I'm very happy I did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it's very helpful. That's great. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? Well, my dream job is I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am an independent contractor. I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs. And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle. But I also enjoy what I do. I'm not under as much stress as I used to be. That sounds like a great decision. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not totally outgoing, but I'm not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle, maybe more towards outgoing, but I'm not totally outgoing. When I'm around other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself. Can you tell me about that? Oh, sure. A couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had bypass operation. It had to do with stress and things like that. I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If I meet someone new, I don't just openly say, well, I've experienced this, this, and this. If it comes up, I won't deny it. If it comes up and I feel like it's something to talk about, I will talk about it. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom, my mother. She's a senior citizen. She's alone. What I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that. That's actually very therapeutic. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm not a short-fused kind of person. It takes a lot to get me really angry. As far as my temper is concerned, there's not much to that. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? I'm trying to think here. I can't recall when the last time it was, but it was probably last year sometime when I had a creditor that I was dealing with being very difficult to work with. I owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago. They weren't very understanding of the situation. I really got a little upset about that because I felt like I was being honest with them and I was more than willing to take care of my issues, but they were playing hardball and I didn't care for that. That sucks. It does. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Probably the hardest decision I ever had to make was it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who was battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him, there was a slight chance it was going to help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point, or it would kill him. That was really tough. It was a really tough decision to make. I felt like if I didn't try and see if we could help save his life or if we didn't take a chance and take that extra step, that I would regret it in the long run. That's really hard. It is. It was. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Right now I'm separated from my wife. She has her issues, I have my issues, but we are not divorced. We are just separated. We still have a relationship where we still speak to each other. We just don't live together. The relationship with my mother is really great. She's very understanding. I'm an only child, so she likes having me around, which is good because she's in her later stage of her life. She's 82 years old. I guess it's good that in its own way, maybe fate has taken place because someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing, but with me there, I think there's a comfort level she feels with me there, especially being her only child. What's something you feel guilty about? Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things that I did to hurt my marriage. As far as the things that I did, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had, and we were growing apart. When she was away, my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. I spent a lot of time in the casinos, and what eventually happened was I spent a lot of money. Obviously, that was a major issue regarding our relationship. It had to do with trust because it was devastating to my wife. How did you feel at that moment? When it came to light, I felt very guilty, and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. I'm sorry. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not at all. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, not really. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping, so no. That's good. Do you feel down? No, not at all. Have you ever spent a change in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. The only thing I can say is that after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. I tend to be a little bit more easygoing, and my friends and family have noticed that. That's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy? Probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. He basically said to me that after many tests and many months of rehabilitation, that he was happy to explain to me that there was no major scar tissue that had occurred because of my heart attack, and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watched my diet and took my medications. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I guess the number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight, just in general be more healthier physically. As far as mentally, just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things, and not to be so selfish. How do you cope with that? Just one day at a time. I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch TV. I do things that I know that if I can help myself, I do things to help myself. Is there anything you regret? There's a lot that I regret, obviously. My marriage, my working career as far as I had a long career with this major's food chain. Basically because of my gambling issues, I ended up ruining a very good career. At this point right now, there's not much I can do. I can't change what's been done, so I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me every day. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself and make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent, but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things, but deep down I don't think as a person I'm a bad person. I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had an illness, a compulsive, obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill. I was a sick person just trying to become healthy. Every day that's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night, one day at a time. How hard is that? It's not as hard as you think, but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you. It could be okay for other people to do certain things, but I cannot do those things anymore. How are your best friends around you? Most of my best friends describe me as probably easygoing, generous, a nice person to be around. They were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage, which it's still not over yet. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning, like around six o'clock. I go to a local park and it's about, this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning. I get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. Then after that I go home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax, and then just kick back for the rest of the day. Then the next day I do the same thing again. In the morning I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch TV, whatever, just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. Nice. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Lock yourself out. Okay. It's kind of, I actually got comfortable talking to you. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, that's pretty cool.",

         "I've been told I don't have depression, and I don't feel 'down,' nor do I have trouble sleeping. However, I've experienced deep guilt and felt 'less than a human being' because of past selfish actions, particularly those that hurt my marriage. I also carry regret about how my gambling issues ruined my career and affected my marriage. I recognize my past behaviors as 'wrong' and 'selfish,' but deep down, I don't think I'm a bad person; I see my compulsive gambling as an 'illness' or 'obsessive compulsive behavior' I was trying to become healthy from.\n\nMy compulsive gambling, which I used as a form of release from tremendous work stress, led to significant financial issues and was devastating to my wife, ultimately leading to our separation. It also ruined a good career. Despite these challenges, I maintain a structured daily life, including living with and helping my mother, which I find very therapeutic. Since my heart attack a few years ago, I've become more easygoing, not letting small things bother me as much.\n\nMy primary struggle was compulsive gambling, which I now understand was an 'illness' or 'obsessive compulsive behavior.' To cope, I live 'one day at a time,' focusing on being at peace with myself and having peace of mind daily. My strategies include meditation, reading, and watching TV. I'm diligent about my behavior and routines, knowing what's not right for me and avoiding those things. I try not to focus on the past, instead concentrating on the present and my ongoing recovery. My gambling issues emerged during a period of high work stress for both my wife and me, causing us to grow apart. My friends were shocked when they learned about my issues. I'm currently living with my 82-year-old mother, which provides comfort for her and is therapeutic for me. My recovery from compulsive behavior is an ongoing daily process.",

         " therapy like this instead of with a live human, it'll put all the MFTs out of business. I think it's good sometimes. I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to, if it's someone that might just go by their questions, might judge you or form opinions. If it's a virtual human being, it might be a little less biased also. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly. All right, so I'm going to start up all the recording and then I'm going to actually... I'm trying to slide on some pictures. Sorry, that's in there. Now she is... So now she's going to have a conversation with you. She's going to ask you some questions. When she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to leave you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're all finished. Thank you very much. How do I know... Is she going to say end of session or... Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. Not at all. Sorry about that. I am. I feel pretty good. I'm wide awake. I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee. And I have an easy day today. So I am just going to chat with you. Then I'm going to the gym and run some errands. So I plan on having a nice day today. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here. And I went to school away. But I'm one of the few natives that are actually in Los Angeles. Yes, I am. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. Having owned a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida. I love the weather here. I like the culture. I like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away, one can go to the desert, say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours away, you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's a great place to live. Thank you. Yeah. Well, maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also the regulations, I'm a small business owner. So all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera, some of the other Western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here in California. It really does. Most people don't understand it, but it's also, besides the high taxes, there's a big immigration problem, which being born and raised here, most people don't see that, but it's the big tax on the social service system. And that's what makes our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's, but people don't seem to want to really deal with that, but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries and I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit and I've learned a couple of languages and I surf. Like what? I'm sorry? Like what? I didn't really understand your question. When you said like what, I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa, and I enjoy that and I enjoy warm climates now, especially where you can go and relax, where there's warm water to surf. It's the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. And I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Oh, sure. One of my favorite trips of all time, whereas I used to when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span, but about 10 years ago, we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city, even though I've been there about 10 times, we got to know the city really well, which was great. Really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping, but really having been there so many times, it really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about almost a month and really get to learn the city and it was fun. Even though I grew up in LA, I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I was younger, so my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable, but I took French all through elementary, junior high and high school. So it was nice to practice my French, even though I don't remember a whole lot, and even though I started speaking French with the French, my accent is some of the greatest, so after a couple of sentences, they start talking English to me. So that was a... Did you study at school? I have a few different degrees. So I was in Naval Science major as an undergraduate, and that was fun. And I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a degree in crisis management. What made you decide to do that? I found them interesting, and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college, I went to the Naval Academy, and I went there to play sports, and I found it real interesting, being from Southern California, going to school in Maryland. And I originally wanted to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. Are you still working in that? I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products, and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather, recently father, passed away, so I sort of run a 80-year-old family business, and it's pretty interesting. I like it, having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. What's your dream job? Actually, probably my dream job? I think it's fun, because I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home, and I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. Because I do have one daughter, and didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked, but I think I would be better than, say, a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids, that I like doing it always on a part-time basis, but it seems like, boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that, having pretty much worked for most of my life. An apartment never happened, but it sounds something that, to me, would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or a villain? I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert, whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted. But I think when I feel comfortable with certain people, and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be totally confident, or people I might have known for years, either from a personal or business situation. And be more introverted. I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy generally, and I like to use the term reserved. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? What do you do to relax? Oh, wow, that's a great idea. I used to have that on one of my ... I have several computers at home, and that used to be one of my screensavers as well. I usually tend, when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, maybe going surfing or the weather is warm. I don't surf in cold weather anymore. This makes ... It gives me like a brain freeze, even though I've surfed for over 30 years. I usually find exercise helps me relax the best, or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver. I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. That's great. That was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master, though, was my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years, I think I've gotten better at them. I think that's a key thing, and I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more ... I hadn't had those skills earlier. How are you at controlling your temper? I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. I am more likely to think before I speak now, whereas, say, 20 years ago, I was more likely to act before I thought. So I might have said more things that I ... In whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation, but I've never had a violent temper, but I would have a temper where I would fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. I think a lot of that comes ... I think the key word there is maturity. When was the last time you argued with someone and had to get it out? Oh, wow. You know, I was in the 20s. Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Basically, one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different, and I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just ... I don't know if I call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married, does someone have children with them? That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep. I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I'm I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",

In whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation, but I've never had a violent temper, but I would have a temper where I would fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. I think a lot of that comes ... I think the key word there is maturity. When was the last time you argued with someone and had to get it out? Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Basically, one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different, and I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just ... I don't know if I call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married, does someone have children with them? That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",
         "I've experienced periods of feeling blue in the past, and I have a family history of it. While these times were concerning, they weren't debilitating, and I was generally able to function on my own. I sought counseling for these concerns, initially being against therapy, but now I find it very useful for gaining clarity and talking through my thoughts and feelings with an unbiased professional, especially an older woman. I also clearly experience seasonal affective disorder; I feel much happier when the weather is nice and sunny, but I tend to feel dark and blue when it's rainy and cold. To relax and manage stress, I rely on exercise like yoga, walking, going to the gym, or surfing, and sometimes just vegging out on the couch. I've worked on mastering these relaxation skills, especially as I've gotten older. I've also improved my emotional regulation; in my younger years, I was more impulsive and would fly off the handle, but now I think before I speak and reflect more. I do regret not spending more time with my parents before they passed and not spending as much time with my daughter when she was younger.",

         " Okay, sounds good. Yeah. I'm great. I'm great. Thank you. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity. I feel LA by itself is a country. There's so much to do, so much to explore. And there's nothing like it. I feel the same. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I like to travel more though. I've been to a few countries. Like what? I've been to, I won't say Europe, that's a continent. I've been to London. I was born here, but my family's from Nigeria, so I've been to Nigeria a few times. I've been to Denmark, Amsterdam. I've been to Germany. And I think that's it. Awesome. What are you enjoying about traveling? Just exploring new places, seeing new things, meeting new people, a different culture. It definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it. And also going to countries that may not be as developed as the US, it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of this country. I'd love to hear about London because... I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm in LA. But at the same time, you can go at a very, very slow pace. We didn't do any driving. We just went on the Tube, which is there, like the underground subway station, which I absolutely fell in love with. Just exploring different parts of the city. We went to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey. When I went there, they had the premiere of, what movie was this, Slumdog Millionaire. And also they had the premiere for Seven Pounds, it was a movie with Will Smith. They did, so Will Smith was over there. Me and my friends were kind of screaming like we were groupies. Just for antics. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. That sounds like a great situation. What did you study at school? Business management and option and human resources management. What that means, I have no idea. How did you decide to do that? Good question. I've always wanted to go into business. And I've always wanted to study finance, but I didn't think I would learn too much about finance from college per se. I think I learned more in the real world, whatnot. So the other option was human resource. And I'm always fascinated about relationships and people, always reading articles about that stuff. So I went for that. Are you still doing that? No. Well, I still kind of use what I've learned, but I work in property management. So it still has to do with people. Anything to do with people, I'm fascinated about. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for you. What's your dream job? That's a good one. My dream job. Wow. I would say being a life coach. Really? Yeah, I would say that was my dream job because I love helping people become successes. And I love being a part of someone else's success, regardless of how small it is. Whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation. You consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm quiet into myself. So, yeah. Right. To relax. I usually listen to music. I usually listen to music to relax me or I pray to relax myself or listen to some really calm music. So, yeah. Very good. Very, very good. I used to, I wouldn't say it was a bad temper, but I was known to go off, quote unquote. Not throwing chairs or anything like that. I'm a very, very patient person. Once that patient is gone and for you to do that, you have to really, really, really, really push my buttons for a long time. And once it's done, I just go off. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. No. What was the last time you argued with somebody? The last time I argued with somebody. Wow. I haven't argued with somebody in a long time. Boy. I argued with my, no. I would say my, I think my dad, I argued with him. About We were disagreeing on some things about when we were going to supposed to go back to Nigeria. And he wasn't listening to, it was kind of like a group discussion, myself and my, my siblings, and he was being very subjective. He wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns. So it started an argument. How did you feel about having to? Very I wouldn't say angry per se, but I felt very kind of like I was losing control. Like I'm the type where I like to be in control of my emotions and my thoughts and I feel once that patience is gone and I start going off, it's kind of like this. This, you know, I would call it a blur, but I'm very witty and quick with what I say. So I'll instantly say something that, you know, Not to say hurtful, but very direct and to the point. I make sure I get my point across. Yeah. I have three brothers, one, one younger, two older, and very close to my family and my mom was one of my best friends. My brothers are great. Love them to death. My father. He's more so out of the picture. Yeah. I don't I don't really I'm not the guilty type. I don't feel guilty. I'm not one to shy away from what I've done and I definitely own up to what I do. I'm not one to shy away from responsibility, but I don't think I ever feel guilty for anything I do. Yeah, I don't think I feel I usually don't feel guilty. Yeah. Pretty, pretty easy. Pretty easy at, you know, pretty good at falling asleep, except when I'm excited or I'm reading. I'm trying to when I'm when I'm focused on learning something like I'll read and read and read, even when it's past my bedtime. But now I'm trying to work on waking up much earlier than when I am now. And that's kind of a little bit of a struggle, but I'm getting to it. So. Good. I've been feeling I've been feeling fine. You know, I'm generally I have a very, very happy disposition. And so no, you know, deep, depressing moods, nothing like that. I will never if I feel do feel like I'm going I don't allow myself to go to that place. No. No. I would say it's I wouldn't say necessary changes, but I'd say more so behaviors, learning how to let go of past decisions, maybe. And kind of how they they played their course in my life. I just sometimes I kind of look back and say, what if I did this? What would have how would life be now? Yeah. So those are some games I play. But other than that, that's it. Is there anything regret? Hmm. Regrets. Uh, no, no, there's anything I regret. What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago, I would say, don't be afraid of who you are. Be authentic. More importantly, with yourself. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Hmm. Erase from my memory. Uh, that's a good one. Erase from my memory. Uh, I would say when I told my dad that he should act like a father. Maybe I should. Yeah, there was. That was actually one of the times I another time I went off, usually with him. Basically, I had decided not to go to a private, not to go away for college. I decided to stay local so I can look after my little brother. And my senior year, I was overloading with everything I had maybe like four AP classes. I was working. I was working three jobs at the time, and I was also on track and field. So, needless to say, I was kind of like burning myself out. And I wasn't doing one AP calculus because I decided to go to a JC first and transfer. Also to save money for college too. And when I told them, you know, the teacher called saying I was falling asleep in class. Just because, mind you, after school I'd work an eight hour shift because I was a retail manager at the time. So, and I'd come home after that shift to do homework, calculus let alone. So, he would get upset and I told him, I spoke to my counselor. I already told him that I don't need that class to go to the JC. Because that's something I'm going to continue with. So I'm just going to, I can't drop out at that point in time. So I'm just going to, you know, just take the D or fail or whatever. And he didn't like that because he is a teacher. I think maybe that's maybe where it came from. He's a teacher as well. And so he started blaming like my job, wanting to call my boss. And it was just too much. And I told him, you know, since you're my father you should act like it. But it was a more aggressive way I said it. So that was one thing. Well, I actually, I do remember, I do regret one thing. And that is I wish I continued with college throughout. Like I burnt myself out. I was spreading myself too thin. I was actually on track to graduate from college at, I want to say 19. Because I started taking college classes in high school, starting sophomore year in high school. But with that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working, I just kind of like stopped going to school for a while and just worked. But I went back to finish. So, but I wish I just would have continued. Maybe that's one small thing, but that's something small though. Yeah. What would you say as somebody who has qualities? I'm very, I'm a very compassionate and understanding person. I like learning new things. I'm a very, very happy person. People come to me for advice. I'm very objective. I'll tell you the good, the bad, the ugly. And yeah, those are some of my best qualities. I'm fun. I like to have fun. I have fun in any situation. I can make light of any situation. Like I'm the kind of type person I can break the tension in the room. That sort of, that sort of personality trait. Cool. Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Michelle's taller. Besides my height. Hmm. I wish maybe. I don't know if it's a be more. I want to say be more in touch with my emotions, but I think I would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes. I think that would be one thing because I'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me. And I'm like, okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate that. But I don't realize how much they do. I think that's realizing how much they care and love me. That's one thing I would like to get more of a grasp on. Yeah. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend. She describes me as someone who's funny, crazy, objective, loyal, ambitious, hardworking, mean. I always make jokes. She says, you're so mean. But. Why? I just like to joke around all the time. And so we were right now actually planning a friend of mine or friend of ours, a baby shower. I'm giving her some ideas. And there's another friend who was invited who we had some issues in the past and someone I don't talk to or hang out with. We used to be really close, but I don't really talk to a person, but I don't mind them being there. So she also talked about celebrating her birthday. Also, kind of like after the baby shower. And there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we didn't do anything for. And I'm like, well, we're celebrating this person's birthday. Might as well. We should definitely honor this person's birthday as well, since we're closer to the person whose birthday is past. And I said, you know what? Just when we celebrate everybody's birthday, forget the baby shower, just do the birthdays. And then she said, you're so mean. But she was laughing about it. So, yeah. Yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of in my life? I would say being there for my family. Being a mentally and emotionally strong person. Family has gone through a lot of challenges, and a lot of times I've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and make sure everything goes accordingly. So I'd say more than anything, making sure I'm there for my family. Okay. I think that's everything I need to say. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Have a good one. Okay. I can take this off? Okay. You wouldn't be the first one to tell her that. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off.

         "I've been feeling really down for about six months now. It started after a major project at work fell through, and since then, it's just been a constant heavy sadness, like a dark cloud hanging over me. I often feel this overwhelming sense of hopelessness and guilt, especially about not being productive or feeling like a burden to my family. Sometimes I just feel numb, and other times I get really irritable, even snapping at my family, which I regret. I've completely lost interest in things I used to love, like reading or hiking; there's just no joy or pleasure in anything anymore.\n\nMy daily life has been severely impacted. I have trouble falling asleep, often waking up multiple times during the night, but then I also oversleep significantly, yet still feel completely exhausted. My appetite is gone; I eat very little, sometimes even forgetting to eat at all. I've been isolating myself a lot, cancelling plans with friends because I just don't have the energy to socialize, and I feel like I'm pushing them away. Even basic tasks like showering feel like a monumental effort. I have no energy, struggle to get out of bed, and can't concentrate on anything, especially work, which has caused my productivity to plummet. I've missed a lot of work and I'm worried about losing my job. My family has been trying to help and my partner is worried about me, but it's hard to accept help when I feel this way. I often find myself just staying in bed, watching TV mindlessly, or avoiding responsibilities, and I've been having some really dark thoughts.",

Just one spot, sorry. Okay, great. One last thing. Perfect. So again, she'll let you know when she's done. I'm going to hand you the doorbell, but I'll try to keep an eye on the time as well. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay. Where are you from originally? I was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA? Originally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA is very has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just sort of I don't know if estranged is the right word but I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. How hard is that? It's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy. So it doesn't really answer your question but Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tape and I'm not sure what I'm doing. I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? I have certain I do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really it soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed. When was the last time that happened? A few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing. How did you decide to do that? I've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me. How hard is that? It's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good. I see what you mean. How are you at controlling your temper? Good. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. What's something you feel guilty about? A lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really really that I really wanted to work and I I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and not and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty that was pretty tough. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Well some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were. I think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself. I mean it's it's possible I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Well it's it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. That's good. How do you cope with them? Um well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using I'm the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet. Are they triggered by something? They're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to to this. It's really it's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't I don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like I would I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep. I don't know. I get up, I toss and turn all night. You know and now it's just it's yeah I don't sleep too great right now. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad. Okay. How long ago were you diagnosed? I think three, three, four years ago. It was when I I had been given taken stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So yeah that was kind of a turning point. But unfortunately it happened after everything went bad. So How did you feel in that moment? In the moment I don't know. I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm that I had that I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain and I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now What got you to say help? What got you to say help? What got you to say help? Um Um There really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either I was I was self-medicating I was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but It was at least that and not firing me. But but but yeah but so I got help but it was. But it wasn't soon enough. Not not as much as I should. I go to a couple of meetings. I go to I go to a so that I can. You know keep control of that aspect to to and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately you know being unemployed my employment ran out you know I'm I'm you know I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. Somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. And then there's you. Right. Well like I said I mean. Just the talk I mean that let's just take the A.A. for example because that's probably the closest closest for them seeing with therapy right now. Just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can do. Something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. You know better than I that I have been. I mean. It's sort of it has its ups and downs. You know I'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just I have to deal with real life which is. It has its own challenge. Yeah. Yeah. It can be tough to find a good job. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um. It was probably you know a couple of years ago. Um. I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. Is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree. And we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and. I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and. Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So. What are you most proud of? Probably the. Probably this. Educate educational series I did. Educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about. And about the world around them so that I feel like that was a really good thing to do. The world. my job. It was a, we were trying to come up with new ideas for, because we would put together videos and stuff to give to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot to it so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend? I don't know. I don't know, it's been a while since I've really thought about that. I don't know, would I go somewhere? Would I? I don't know. Thank you. Howdy. Thank you.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nAre there any parameters? I mean, should I just talk naturally or just however I'm comfortable? Whatever you're comfortable, just talk naturally. I'm going to go ahead and just fix this. Just one spot, sorry. Okay, great. One last thing. Perfect. So again, she'll let you know when she's done. I'm going to hand you the doorbell, but I'll try to keep an eye on the time as well. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay. Where are you from originally? I was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA? Originally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just sort of I don't know if estranged is the right word but I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often.

         "I'm feeling a little pensive and down today. My old life, before I lost my job, weighs on my mind a lot; I miss my friends and relationships and feel like I failed, unable to get back on my feet. Most of my anger is directed inward. I still feel immense guilt about a past relationship that ended badly because I wasn't on the right medication, causing everything to spiral out of control. I dwell on things constantly, taking little details and thinking about them until it drives me crazy. Even things from high school can still make me feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, and ashamed, like I'm right back there.\n\nMy sleep isn't great; I'm a very light sleeper, tossing and turning all night, and I'm really starting to feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. I'm also pretty estranged from my family and old friends. My mental state significantly impacted my work, leading to me being laid off after being institutionalized once or twice. It makes me angry that I lost everything due to brain chemistry and inadequate help from previous doctors.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression about three or four years ago, though I was on anxiety medication for years before that. Now, with the right medication, I still get upset and depressed, but I don't completely lose it for days at a time like I used to. For a long time, I coped by drinking to slow my mind down. Now, to manage my thoughts, I have to keep my brain constantly occupied, often doing two things at once, like playing a game on my phone while watching TV. I wish I could just let the thoughts come and deal with them, but I can't yet. These thoughts are triggered by everything – anything I see or hear can connect back to them, and I never get a break.\n\nI go to AA meetings, which has a therapy aspect, and I have a psychiatrist, though I only see her a few times a year to keep my medication coming since I'm unemployed. Saying things out loud, trying to make sense of the mess in my head, is a big step. While the chemical parts of my depression feel more under control now, I'm still dealing with real-world problems like applying for jobs daily and never getting a response, which makes it hard to feel self-sufficient. The last time I felt truly happy was a couple of years ago, when everything was going well, and I felt like a normal person, and I don't know if I'll ever feel that again.",

Just, you know, I have all my family here, my mom, my dad, my cousins, aunts, uncles. So, practically, I have my life here. So, I probably, I mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know, just my curiosity hasn't, you know, gone there, I guess. Okay. What's your favorite part about Guatemala? I love the people. Everyone's nice. I love the diversity, you know. There's different types of people and imaginations out there. You know, everything's just great. You know, everyone's different, you know. No one's like the same, at least to some aspects. And I love the scenery. I love, you know, the mountains. They're beautiful, you know, great for hikes, you know, taking out, you know, the dog, the family, you know. It's nice. It's pretty active. Yeah. What is your favorite smog? The smog. I don't like the smog. It's just, you know, if you go out further out, you know, you could tell by the air, you know, or, you know, everything's clear. The sky's bluer. But other than that, like, you know, in traffic, nobody likes traffic, I think. Yeah. But yeah, that's, you know, pretty much LA is pretty nice, you know. I like it. That's good. What did you study at school? Well, I was studying just basic, you know. I'm not sure exactly what I want to be. So it's just kind of, you know, here and there, just jumping through hoops and stuff. So not really set yet. It's still trying to find my interest, I suppose. What's your dream job? My dream job. That's a good one. I love working with children. So I would say probably a child psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what's going on in the young minds and, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, make children, you know, or help, you know, help them, you know, grow up in a positive way, I suppose, instead of, like, going the wrong track. Yeah. I just, you know, help children. Is it just so high-five or up-going? It depends. It depends on the situation I'm in. Sometimes, you know, I could be, like, super outgoing and just, like, you know, and sometimes I could just, I could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention, you know, if I'm, like, in class or whatever. I don't really, like, and there's everyone talking. I just, I prefer just to stay away from that, you know, because I need something else to concentrate on something else. You know, there's, like, a moment in time for everything, I suppose. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm being there, I turn on the first page of the screen favorite. Hey, I know it's not blind, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to kick my feet up on the couch and, like, read a good book, you know, just get my mind going to another, you know, galaxy or universe or situation, you know. It's pretty fun, you know, just, you know, reading and then just having yourself relaxed and, you know, feeling good. That's great. Yeah, it is. It's just fun. I love reading. How are you at controlling your own mood? I'm okay with it. I'm not, like, the best, you know, temper-controlling person there is out there. You know, I try my best and I guess that's all I could do until I keep doing better eventually. But I'm not, like, the best. I mean, I sometimes I do have my outbursts, you know. But, you know, I guess that's everyone. I'm not sure. When was the last time you argued with him? Ah, huh. That's a good question. That's a good question. I don't remember. Let's see. Honestly, I can't recall. Maybe. My goodness. I don't know. Sometimes I'm very passive. That's just like let things go because, I mean, what's the point of making a big deal out of things? You know, so, huh, I don't know. I honestly I can't tell you that at this moment. Why don't we talk about that later? Sure. Yeah, probably come back to it. What's something with your relationship? Um, huh. Well, I guess when I was younger, I, you know, could have been better older sister and I wasn't. And that makes me feel guilty for sure. You know, I could have been a better sister. Better role model. But I'm trying my best now, so I'm trying to make things better. And it's working. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your ex-wife. Oh, I guess, huh. Hmm. I don't know. I mean, I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life. So if I erase something, then it's just there's something of me in my present self or, you know, that would change. And I don't know. I'm pretty OK with the person that I am now. I mean, you know, I don't think I would change an event. You know, I'm OK with what, you know, ups and downs and good and bad that has happened. OK. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. But I am kind of like an explorer, I guess. I love to explore, like, even the smallest things. Like if I go hiking, I go off trail and, you know, just find my way up to the top, you know, somehow some way and just make it, you know, traveling. I would love to do that. But I don't know, just, you know, always circumstances in my life that doesn't, you know, always something, you know, I get married, children, you know, and all this. So it's kind of like, you know, it would be nice, I guess, you know, it would be nice. You know, I love camping. That's kind of like, you know, taking a few days trips out there, camping and fishing. Yeah. It was this summer, you know, me and my husband went camping and it was really nice. It was just me and him, you know, and it was like no one. And it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake. And, you know, it was it was really nice. It was just, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was. It was. It was really fun. It was like I would love to do it again, you know, right now. It would be great, you know, just going out there. It's just I love that venture of things and the nature and just life and, you know, overall. Yeah. It's easy, but lately I haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because I don't know, just, you know, just I'm laying there and I'm just like trying to go to sleep and I'm just like, oh, but eventually I do. You know, I just I probably like need to position myself in a different side of the bed. Like sometimes I'm in the headboard and I'm like, oh, I got to go to the other side. And once I position myself, then I just like go to sleep, you know, but it just I got to find the right position for me. Yeah. Um, I'm tired. I get tired throughout the day, you know, but I kind of try to shake it off, you know, and just kind of like feel like it's a new day, you know, and just try to make the day that I have as great as possible, you know, and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of, you know. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, it's OK. I try to make it the best, I guess. If not, then I just go to sleep throughout the day, which sucks. But yeah. No. No. I've been feeling good. Yeah, I've been feeling really good. You know, a lot of things in my life have, you know, I'm having a really good year so far. So I'm very happy with that. You know, everything's, you know, going good, you know. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. It is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible. But that's just nature. My immune system has to work harder. Super happy was when the doctor told me I was pregnant. You know, I was really, really happy about that. And I was just like, oh, you know, that was really, really good. You know, very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby. And, oh, that's very overwhelming. And it's scary at the same time. I've never really like, you know, but yeah, I'm very happy. Yeah. I don't know. I guess just me myself, you know, like, you know, I could, you know, just be myself and that's it. You know, just I can't really, you know, say I have a specific thing, I guess. I mean, it depends on the person that meets me to tell me. I can't really tell myself like, oh, I'm this, I'm that, you know, just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to, you know, tell me or, you know, compliment me or whatnot. Yeah. Oh, nothing, I think. Um, like I said, I'm happy with the person I am right now. And, you know, my flaws or whatever, you know, I might have, I don't know, whatever flaw people see in me and it's OK. You know, I'm OK with it. Whatever it just I'm not going to I can't change myself for the likings of other people. I have only one body and one life. So, yeah, yeah, that's it. Ah, just my childhood with my sisters and my family. But, you know, it's, you know, you learn from that, you learn from the past and you kind of feel like, hey, you know, maybe I should be a better role model, you know, for my children. And so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve. Um, just smile and be happy, you know, and whatever hard things happen, you know, you're going to get through them eventually, you know, the only thing you can't do is to be happy. You can't, I don't know, you can't, you know, go back on his death. You know, you could, you know, a heartbreak or whatever. But, you know, as long as I'm alive, I still got to keep going. Yeah. I don't know. That's pretty, huh, most proud of. I guess that I'm trying my best to be the best I could be. And that's pretty powerful. You know, I'm, you know, I try to be, you know, a better person each day and try to like, you know, improve myself every day as much as I can. You know, that would probably be something I could be super proud of, you know, as much as I can. Very hard. I'm not going to lie. It is really hard, you know, because I can't say, you know, it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good. You know, and, you know, it's always challenges and everything that goes, you know, in your life. But, you know, it's just it's sometimes, you know, hard, you know, and sometimes it comes easy, you know, after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try, you know. So, yeah. You know, loving, friendly, outgoing, you know, adventures, I guess. I don't know. That's what they say. Just, you know, that's them. Like, you know, but that's what at least what I try to be. You know, at least I try to give the best foot forward always as much as possible. You know, even sometimes even if I'm having a rough day, I'm just like, oh, you know, you know, I just I don't want to be bad. You know, I just I don't want to take it out on anyone or anything, you know. Yeah. Yeah. How do you spend your ideal weekend? My ideal weekend. Usually I like going to the park. I like sitting down in like a tree under a tree, actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there, have my dog and like read a book. And, you know, sometimes if I don't have my dog, like there's little scrolls running around and they like me to feed them. So that's pretty neat, you know, just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise, I guess, because there's not silence. You know, the wind and the cars and, you know, it's just it's really neat. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.",
         "Okay, awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. You know, how about yourself? I'm great. Awesome. Where are you from?

         "I've been feeling really good lately, actually, and I'm having a very happy year so far with everything going well, especially since I found out I'm pregnant, which makes me very excited, though it's also overwhelming and scary. However, I do have some challenges. Lately, I haven't been able to fall asleep right away at night; I just lie there trying to find the right position. This makes me tired throughout the day, and sometimes I end up sleeping during the day, which I don't like. I try to shake off the tiredness and make the day as great as possible. I also admit I'm not the best at controlling my mood and sometimes have outbursts, but I try my best to improve. A past feeling that makes me feel guilty is not having been a better older sister when I was younger, but I'm working to make things better now. Despite any hard things that happen, I believe I'll get through them and I always try to smile and be happy, striving to be the best person I can be every day. Even on rough days, I make sure not to take it out on anyone. To relax, I love reading a good book to get my mind going, and I also enjoy camping and being out in nature.",

         " Since there's nothing else Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty okay. Thanks for asking. How are you? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm from here in LA. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Cool. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? What do you enjoy about traveling? I love traveling. I like experiencing new things. I think that would be nice. Despite the fact that I said I like the familiarity of LA, there's also fun in discovering new things. So I think when I travel, that's what I like to do, just check new things out. If I could make a living doing that, that would be great. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips? Okay, well, let's see. The last trip I took... Let me think of one more exciting trip. Well, my family is from Eastern Europe, so one of the trips I took with my parents when I was 14 was I went to Austria, Hungary, and Romania, and getting to see some of those old... I'd been a few times before, but it was when I was little, so I don't really have too much memory. Plus, I didn't really process things quite the same as when I was kind of more of age. So I got to see my family's old hometown. We have a family tomb, so I got to see that. Then just these old buildings and just a different way of life. I really like that, seeing my parents' old friends. So that was pretty fun. It was very different. It was really my first time being taken away from my home environment. I left them all the school year, so it was just like going from suburban America to traveling around, taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old hundreds of year old towns. I don't know if it was for everyone. I don't know. It would be great for everybody, but I really enjoyed it. Awesome. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? That's a good question. I probably one of the things I do is either turn on a rerun of a sitcom. I watch The Office a lot, so I kind of know when that's on. So I'll turn that on, just kind of zone out a little bit to familiar characters and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason. Or maybe eating some kind of comfort food. I try not to eat too much fast food at all, but in and out, I really like going there. So if I have to unwind once every few months, maybe I'll do that. Or I really like to read, especially like I'll read the day's events. That really relaxes me for some reason. Even if it's reading about some conflict going on somewhere in the world, I still read the headlines. I really like to know what's going on. That kind of centers me. So I really enjoy that. That's something I do to relax. How are you at controlling your temper? I would say I'm pretty great at it, although I think my nature makes it pretty easy. I don't get very upset easily at all. So it's not much of a challenge to control my temper. Yeah, I don't really have anger issues. It's difficult for me to get angry. So I don't really have much trouble with that at all. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody was probably...I don't even know. Small disagreements I might have had with family or friends about things. But just a full-on argument, I can't even remember. It's been years. I don't really argue too much. I try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my personal life. I don't really see anything to be gained by it. I naturally repel away from it. So I don't have much to say about arguing.

flexible schedule but at on the same token uh... i wish i could were like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up so one or two every night uh... and is just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or what not asleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i wish i were more uh... able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven and then sleep and wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later waking up later i'm pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health wise i feel good uh... you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh... uh... everything is great so far i i've absolutely no no real complaints uh... as far as i'm feeling on myself for anything like that no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that uh... everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing uh... kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort is this happened there is happening no no well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh... yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things uh... in my life uh... yeah like i said i i do regret uh... you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh... i hung out with a lot of friends yeah i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us work we just uh... you know we we got high every day uh... or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh... it was a kind of like a throwaway period of my life i would say that uh... it's important to to to engage with the world i think i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to uh... recognize the people around you for what they are you know what what kind of potential you know future activities that you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh... i would say also that uh... can try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that uh... that approach is kind of fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know uh... just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule life is in a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and uh... thinking that things will fall into place well i i guess when people i i don't especially uh... take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that at least for myself i sort of five things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh... group work that done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is kinda picked apart or scrutinized i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should uh... was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh... somebody with much less it was three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it and there was somebody just out of college you know uh... went over what we had done and you know just kinda rewording things and it seems just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of changing things and i can't take personal fence to that just uh... because i thought i had a lot more experience more education and uh... it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just uh... i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to necessarily redo all our work uh... or or even to uh... now not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh... uh... proofread i guess that to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know it was kind of like uh... an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but it wasn't our call most memorable experiences uh... well i guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my uh... the first real trip i took by myself uh... i i took the uh... the amtrak to new mexico and i was out there exploring things uh... for about ten days on my own uh... so that was kind of the longest period of time up till that point and i was in my i was twenty three maybe at the time that i had had really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time uh... it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh... you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions uh... and it was a lot of fun uh... uh... why been very happy recently i mean for that i'm getting married in a few months i got engaged on labor day uh... in two thousand twelve thanks so i was uh... that was a very happy day this this whole process you know uh... meeting someone and we we kind of progressed very quickly realize where we recognize where we were so i've been a pretty happy state the past uh... well it's been eleven months now but uh... yes so i think that the day we got engaged and we we shared with our family i think those have been very happy times uh... new years was happy you know i've been a happy period of my life right now so yeah thank you uh... with the sort of uh... sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh... also uh... you know uh... helpful calm relaxed maybe uh... intelligent uh... you know likes to recycle i know that's a subject that they would say uh... and what else i think that uh... best friend might say that uh... i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats they might describe as a people person i mean an animal person excuse me i also you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans uh... i'd say one of the most part of my life i i i'm pretty happy with the level education i've gotten i'm also going back and starting the fall and starting a phd programs i'm happy about that happy about you know breaking some of that habits from the past i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that uh... you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't pride is the right word but uh... my relationships with family and friends are all very good uh... i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change and i'm happy and proud of that no problem have a good day thank you goodbye okay All right.",

         "I've been feeling incredibly down, like a heavy cloud is constantly over me. It's more than just sadness; it's a profound lack of joy, even in things I used to love. I often feel numb, but then overwhelming sadness can hit me. There's a lot of guilt too, for not being able to just 'snap out of it' or be there for my loved ones. Sometimes I feel completely hopeless about things ever getting better, and I can be quite irritable.\n\nThis feeling has really impacted my daily life. My sleep is a mess – I struggle to fall asleep, wake up early, and still feel exhausted. My appetite changes; sometimes I eat too much, other times nothing at all, and food just doesn't taste good. I have zero motivation for anything. It's incredibly hard to even get out of bed or do basic tasks like showering. I've withdrawn from friends and family, avoiding calls and cancelling plans because I feel like such a burden. My work is suffering because I can't focus, and I'm constantly tired.\n\nI find myself just lying in bed, staring at the ceiling a lot. I try to push through, but it truly feels like I'm walking through mud. This has been going on for months now; it started subtly a while ago and has just gotten worse.",

         " Nice, I have my hair. You see what you look like, you're like, oh my god, I look dumb. So this picture is not based on a real woman at all. No, they used, it's not based on an actual person. Okay, so when she's done, I'll just wait for a flash in our system. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people and based them on my experience. I'm not a bear but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'd love to give you questions and insights. And since you're a baby, your interests are fully confirmed. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. It's still morning, so. Where are you from originally? I'm from the East Coast, Massachusetts. Really? Yes. When did you move to LA? I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents. Pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been back there. The last time I was back there was three years ago for Christmas. How does it compare to LA? LA is very hustle and bustle. There's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA. In which back east, the East Coast, the thought pattern is a lot different. You know your neighbors, you're friendly to your neighbors and you're kind to anybody that you see in the street. So, yeah. How would you say it was a period that you feel alone? Well, since I was a kid, I was fairly young. At first it was rough. I was getting in trouble a little bit in school. But after all that surpassed, I did fine in high school and stuff and even took some college courses. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, I love the beach and I love the mountains. I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach. I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy. Nice. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not at all. Why? Just not interested. I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger. Went to Ensenada. But other than that, I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what's been going on lately overseas. Okay. What did you study in school? Actually, child psychology. And I was in the nursing program for a little bit. But I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. What are you doing? That's right. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? I don't have one. To be honest, I admire people that are doing the job that they love. I mean, like football players. They love playing football and they get paid all that money. How great is that? Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I'm pretty outgoing. When I meet somebody at first, I might be a little bit reserved because we all, when we meet somebody, pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not. But once I've decided that I like that person or whatever, I talk a lot. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? I like watching movies. I used to like reading, but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great, so it's hard to get into a good book. How are you at control of your temper? Not good at times. I have some outbursts every once in a while. It depends on how angry I get. When was the last time you argued with someone? Yesterday. It was with my partner. Actually, to be honest, I don't remember what it was about. Sometimes people can have an ugly attitude, and I don't appreciate that. If I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever, I'm going to stand up for myself. Do you have problems with your partner? At times, some people may be turned off of my personality because I'm very opinionated. I say what's on my mind. I do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature. But I won't be bullied, and I won't back down if I feel like I'm being challenged. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in with your partner. Last year, my mother died. I wish I handled that differently. Is it uncomfortable when you talk about it? It upsets me. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see. I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that will upset me more. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That is terrible. Sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem, especially when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day, you're tired. But staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I get up and then I'm wide awake. I'll go out in the living room, turn on the TV, and watch TV. I think I'll get three to four hours sleep. Maybe because I do have a lot on my mind, thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and all this other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it. It's not difficult, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes on overtime mode, it just affects everything, your concentration, your sleep, your eating, everything. What are you like when you're grouchy? I'm a little grouchy, especially in the morning. I'm not a morning person. I like the nights, but I don't like the mornings. It's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee. Other than that, I'm okay. How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been depressed for quite some time, and I'm still having difficulty. After my mother died four months later, my uncle died. I had two deaths last year, so I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. Just recently, I've started pursuing interests that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened. Have you ever spent a day in the living room or the bathroom? I might get angry a little easier. I sleep a lot. I eat. I overeat. I get tired very easily because I don't get much sleep. Sometimes it's hard. It seems like I'm struggling to get through the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I was diagnosed quite some time ago. Probably 10 to 15 years ago. It's just something I've never gotten over. I don't know whether or not you can, so I've always taken the medicine. What kind of medicine did you take? I was arguing with everybody, my family, my friends, and stuff like that. I was feeling desperate and hopeless. I had attempted to take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized. Then they started treating me. I started seeing a therapist. Are you going to a therapist? Well, right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance, they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. But I am working with a friend of mine who knows some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist. I don't know if that's really going to help me. It depends on what kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on, and you're thinking, my God, what good is this? The other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions. What sort of changes have you noticed in your therapy? Like I said, I haven't been going to therapy recently, just psychiatry, just medication. There's been no changes, really. I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away. I was her caregiver. Even though a lot of times I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I still was a heck of a lot happier than I am now. How many of us in the last few years felt really happy? I would say when my son was born, years ago. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I'm not a parent anymore. He passed away. That was difficult as well. I'm sorry you're late. What would you say as a mother about telling you? I'm extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done, but sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained. Those qualities are admirable in people that can keep their word and be responsible. Excuse me? Oh, I have lots of regrets. Things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about. I met somebody once in my life that had that saying, and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. You can't go back and make changes. It's too late, so why dwell on the situation? Sometimes it's a lot easier said than done. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'm not the advice kind of get person. I don't really give my friends any kind of advice. I find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway, so why bother? I just state my opinion. That's all. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating. After my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive. I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot. Sleep, eat, sleep, eat. Now I'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight because it's very unhealthy for me. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I'm trying to think it's been a long time. Actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy. I haven't been to a movie in ages. I used to go out shopping all the time. I don't now. So it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now. Tell me how you spend your weekend. My weekends, like on Saturday I'm usually working. On Sunday is usually clean up day. Do your laundry, clean up the house, run some errands, go shopping for food. That kind of thing. If I was younger it would be fun to go out clubbing or whatever, but I'm too old for that now. What are you most proud of in your life? Really there's nothing that I can think of. There's nothing that I can be proud of. What are some things that you do that you can give me? A good comedy or whatever. I like to watch that. Sometimes my partner might do something stupid, which I like because I make fun of them. But that's it. Maybe go out for a walk on the beach. That's it. Okay. No problem. Thank you. Bye. Does somebody talk for her or is she just talking to me really? I'll actually explain to you how she works once we're finished up with the study. Okay. Can you actually take that headset off? Thank you.",

What are you like when you're grouchy? I'm a little grouchy, especially in the morning. I'm not a morning person. I like the nights, but I don't like the mornings. It's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee. Other than that, I'm okay. How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been depressed for quite some time, and I'm still having difficulty. After my mother died four months later, my uncle died. I had two deaths last year, so I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. Just recently, I've started pursuing interests that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened. Have you ever spent a day in the living room or the bathroom? I might get angry a little easier. I sleep a lot. I eat. I overeat. I get tired very easily because I don't get much sleep. Sometimes it's hard. It seems like I'm struggling to get through the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I was diagnosed quite some time ago. Probably 10 to 15 years ago. It's just something I've never gotten over. I don't know whether or not you can, so I've always taken the medicine. I was arguing with everybody, my family, my friends, and stuff like that. I was feeling desperate and hopeless. I had attempted to take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized. Then they started treating me. I started seeing a therapist. Are you going to a therapist? Well, right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance, they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. But I am working with a friend of mine who knows some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist. I don't know if that's really going to help me. It depends on what kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on, and you're thinking, my God, what good is this? The other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions. What sort of changes have you noticed in your therapy? Like I said, I haven't been going to therapy recently, just psychiatry, just medication. There's been no changes, really. I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away. I was her caregiver. Even though a lot of times I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I still was a heck of a lot happier than I am now. How many of us in the last few years felt really happy? I would say when my son was born, years ago. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I'm not a parent anymore. He passed away. That was difficult as well. I'm sorry you're late. What would you say as a mother about telling you? I'm extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done, but sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained. Those qualities are admirable in people that can keep their word and be responsible. Excuse me? Oh, I have lots of regrets. Things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about. I met somebody once in my life that had that saying, and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. You can't go back and make changes. It's too late, so why dwell on the situation? Sometimes it's a lot easier said than done. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'm not the advice kind of get person. I don't really give my friends any kind of advice. I find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway, so why bother? I just state my opinion. That's all. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating. After my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive. I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot. Sleep, eat, sleep, eat. Now I'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight because it's very unhealthy for me. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I'm trying to think it's been a long time. Actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy. I haven't been to a movie in ages. I used to go out shopping all the time. I don't now. So it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now. Tell me how you spend your weekend. My weekends, like on Saturday I'm usually working. On Sunday is usually clean up day. Do your laundry, clean up the house, run some errands, go shopping for food. That kind of thing. If I was younger it would be fun to go out clubbing or whatever, but I'm too old for that now. What are you most proud of in your life? Really there's nothing that I can think of. There's nothing that I can be proud of. What are some things that you do that you can give me? A good comedy or whatever. I like to watch that. Sometimes my partner might do something stupid, which I like because I make fun of them. But that's it. Maybe go out for a walk on the beach. That's it.",
         "I've been depressed for quite some time, and I'm still having difficulty. After my mother died last year, and then my uncle four months later, I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. I was doing great before my mom passed away, even though being her caregiver often felt overwhelming.\n\nMy mood is often low; I can be grouchy, especially in the mornings, and I might get angry a little easier. I was feeling desperate and hopeless at one point, and years ago, I even attempted to take my own life, which led to hospitalization and starting treatment. I was diagnosed with depression probably 10 to 15 years ago, and I've always taken medication prescribed by my psychiatrist. I'm not seeing a therapist right now because of insurance, but a friend is helping me look for options. I'm not sure if therapy will really help, as I've found some therapists just listen without offering tools. There haven't been any changes recently with just medication.\n\nMy daily functioning is significantly impacted. Getting a good night's sleep is terrible; I might fall asleep, but staying asleep is hard. I often wake up wide awake and only get three to four hours of sleep, probably because my mind goes into overtime, thinking about bills and work stress. This affects everything – my concentration, sleep, and eating. I sleep a lot and overeat, especially after my mom died, which has led to weight gain. I'm on a diet now to try and lose it.\n\nMy concentration level hasn't been great lately, making it hard to get into a good book. Sometimes it feels like I'm struggling just to get through the day. I used to enjoy going out shopping and to movies, but I don't anymore. I just try to keep my mind busy. Recently, I've started pursuing some interests I used to do, but haven't in a year. It's been a long time since I've felt content or happy with who I am or what I'm doing. There's really nothing I can think of that I'm proud of in my life. I also tend to argue with family and friends more easily. I wish I had handled things differently after my mother died, but it's too upsetting to talk about. My son also passed away, which was very difficult. I try to relax by watching movies or the fish tank screen saver, and sometimes walking on the beach.",

         " Okay. All right. Thanks. Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks. Hi. Yeah. Go ahead. Okay. I grew up in Wisconsin and I grew up in the Colorado for a bit and then I lived overseas for a little while and then I moved to California. I moved here at the end of June of last year, so I guess it's been eight months, something like that. Yeah. At the most, probably twice a year. Well, my hometown is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms. So the opposite of LA. Okay. It's a good question. I always wanted to live in California, but I had been living in the Central Coast and I just had been coming down to LA once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff. So yeah, things were changing. In Santa Cruz for me, the client I had who was really the main financial source I had, that relationship ended, so I was totally free to move and I thought, well, I guess I'll give LA a try and see what happens. So I gave it a shot and here I am. No, not at all. It's a very, very big city. I lived in Dublin in Ireland, which is also a big city, but European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy. Yeah, so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city and the people that are traveling and, well. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I love to travel. I love it. I lived in Ireland and I traveled. I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica. I love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures, and also not just seeing what's different, but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go. Sure. Well, I guess I'm trying to think which was my favorite. I mean, there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both, but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days and we went to three different locations. We went up in the Atlas Mountains, which are beautiful. Yeah, it's a really, really cool culture. It was fun. What was the most memorable experience? My trip to Ireland, I actually visited there, which is why I decided to move there. So my most memorable moment of that trip, I mean, there's probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being on a bus and leaving Dublin and going just down to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is. Everyone sees pictures of Ireland or you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous, but you actually get there and experience it. The pictures don't do it justice. It was incredible. Awesome. What did you study at school? I have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies. Are you still working on that? No, I use my English and psychology. I work in marketing communications. I actually do sales. So yeah, the psychology definitely comes into play and so does my, I guess my undergrad degree in English, but really I took that on and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I wasn't wanting to teach. What made you decide to do that? I guess I'm not clear on the question. Let's come back to that later. Okay. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? Wow. My dream job is being a motivational speaker and trainer and coach and traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship is pretty good actually. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who was sporadic. I saw her sporadically growing up. I lived, my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together. So I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with. But I got in communication with my biological mother last May and we've been cleared things up and have been in communication since then. How did you feel in that moment? Well, I'm not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and not just the future but in the present moment with her. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? To relax I do a number of things. I like to do yoga although I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance. I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharges my battery actually. Probably more than anything else. I like to be with friends. I love art and trying new restaurants. Yeah, all those things are both relaxing. I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life. How are you at controlling your hunger? Depends. If I'm driving, not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it. When was the last time you argued with someone? Last time I argued with somebody. Probably would have to be... Oh no, it was with the LA Times about the newspaper delivery. Yeah, that was the last time. Yeah, the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of. It didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until I don't know, afternoon, I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10.30 in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. For a service that would pay for it for every day. Yeah, I was really irritated. Then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me. I was angry with the LA Times, I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. Yeah, I was pretty frustrated. Oh wow, there are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program and it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be, we have meetings every week, classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach and that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so in that moment it just seemed to me like, oh my god I have all these people I have to be accountable to and I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was I don't know. I wasn't angry I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and you know and I talked it out with her and we got through it but yeah I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother. The hardest decision wow there's been a few. I guess moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision. No it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging but the hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family. I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that was a pretty tough decision because at that point my family had been within an hour's drive of wherever I lived an hour, hour and a half and now they were going to be a 12 hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was challenging. Oh lots of things I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado so there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single that was another factor and were interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit and then I found a job that I liked, the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and I chose to move. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That was a totally unrelated question. Relatively easily it just depends on what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11.30 then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired and I don't know how much better I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those or if I stir from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. Are they triggered by something? I'm moving out of the house that I live in right now where I take care of an elderly woman and I have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being, she's exhausting and utterly depressing. How hard is that? Living with her is pretty hard, it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again. Honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation. How have you been feeling lately? I'm like this, there's nothing I can there's no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy. Have you been diagnosed with depression? How long ago were you diagnosed? What got you to see me out? Did you feel down? Do you still get a therapy now? I don't actually, no. Why did you stop? Well I originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed, we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and then I began therapy again later on it was in my early 30's and then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland. Yeah I mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention I don't go into therapy thinking oh I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy. Huh. Wow that's pretty sad. It was at least a year ago. No that's not true it was when I saw my biological mother which was last May. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities. I'm very strong. Very strong willed. I'm very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent and I'm... Yeah. Anything I regret. I don't think so. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't think too seriously. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends. Either going out a night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar. Somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to and then I have brunch with friends and yeah I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day. What are you most proud of in your life? I am most proud of a few things. I've moved to places that I wanted to move to. I've done things that have really spoken to me. And have meant something to my heart. Achieve those goals. I've done things that I've wanted to do. Move to Ireland and move to California. That's great. Okay I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye.

         "Lately, I've been feeling pretty crappy, like there's no way out of my current situation. No matter what I do, things don't seem to get any better, especially with not getting the kind of work I want and my money not working out at all. I haven't felt truly happy in a long time; the last time was about eight months ago when I saw my biological mother.\n\nMy current living situation, where I care for an elderly woman, creates a lot of anxiety. She's exhausting and utterly depressing to be around. Living with her is probably the hardest thing I've ever done, and I would never choose to do it again. Honestly, if I knew what I was getting into, I don't think I would have said yes. This situation, combined with needing to find financial means to support myself, makes me feel trapped and overwhelmed.\n\nWhile I can generally sleep through the night, I've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks, though I can usually fall back asleep. To relax, I like to do yoga, but I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance, read, and go to the ocean to stare at the waves; that really recharges my battery more than anything else. I also like being with friends, enjoying art, and trying new restaurants. When I'm feeling tense, I sometimes turn on the fish tank screensaver. I've had depression before; I stopped therapy when I was no longer depressed, and then again when I moved to Ireland. I see therapy as a way to work on specific problems and gain tools for life, not as a permanent thing.",

         " She'll ask you some stuff, but yeah, she can understand. So when she's done, she'll let you know. You can put the door up over here. Hopefully it'll work, but I'll try to... Sometimes my sister can talk to me. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me Feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Boston. Really? When did you move to LA? About 30 years ago. That's a long time. Yep. When do you go back to your hometown? Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Oh, I love living in LA. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. Why did you move to LA? Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. The beginning of the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? Broadcast journalism. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. Are you still working on that? Nope. Why? Well, it's kind of a long story but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just, once I had done that work, I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. Yeah. It could be tough to find a good job these days. Yep. What's your dream job? My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Nice. How hard is that? Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to. I don't travel so much right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like where I'm from. Uh huh. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday because I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international dateline. I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay where native dolphins live and swim. It's very isolated for the most part. I got to be there for a whole weekend pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins. They come and swim with you. It's amazing. It's just a beautiful, beautiful spot in the world. Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More shy. Why? Why? Hmm. That's a good question. Partly the first thing I think of is because I've always been that way. But maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach because I live close to the beach. So that's one of my favorite things to relax. Uh huh. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Um. I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations. But not at people directly. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. I don't know if I feel guilty about anything at the moment. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I'm not sure I have one at the moment. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That just makes me really mad. That sucks. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. You know, I didn't know that I could do it. I didn't, wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. Um. So that felt like a really difficult decision. But in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time, it was really difficult to do that. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment. So that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm great. But it's because I am worried. But you know, I'm also confident that things are going to work out. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either. Sort of like just a even keel. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, I got to go to my friend's work at the Motion Picture Academy, so I get to see all the Oscar-nominated movies. She was there one night, so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again. So that was very pleasant. Nice. How would your best friend describe you? I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. Is there anything you regret? No. I really worked hard on that. I think there are lots of things maybe I would do differently, but there's nothing that really I regret. Like what? Well, I just think that there are things that... Like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good question. Don't worry about the small stuff and save more money. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, you know, the normal things. Like I'd lose more weight and I would... I think be a little more fearless maybe. Be a little more bold. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't think I have any of those. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Well, I am self-employed so I work all the time. So my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something I enjoy. So that would be ideal at this point, my weekends, if I were really busy. What are you most proud of in your life? That I've really been able to take care of myself. And that, you know, I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do. I've done that and I don't have regrets about things. There's nothing really that feels undone in my life. Sure, there's plenty of things I still want to do. But I feel like I've done what I said I was going to do. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, that's not so great. Well, it's okay. Both my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister but they both live on the East Coast and I live in LA. And my sister has two girls so I feel very close to my nieces. Although we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers. So they have other things on their mind. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my teacher, the person I learned my holistic bodywork from. That's so good to hear. How close are you to them? What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? What would be a good mood? Usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or just spending time with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. It worked again. So now I'm going to have you move over to the other computer. So you can do a quick post survey about your experience.",

         " Okay. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions and I'll answer them. And please feel free to comment below and your answers are really comforting. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling okay. I'm a little bit tired but for the most part, I'm feeling pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills, which is out in the San Fernando Valley. I was born there. And then I moved to Lomita, which is in Los Angeles County, about probably around 1993. So, I'm 23 now. So, it's about what, 19 years or so I've been living there. What are some things you really like about LA? Some things that I really like, I would have to say, you know, the beach. You know, not so much the traffic. I don't really care for that. But definitely, you know, just kind of like the nightlife. You know, just people in general. I like conversing with others. So, yeah. I see what you mean. Right. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, actually I do. I mean, I can't see your shoes. But yeah, actually I do travel a lot. I've been to places like Hawaii. I've been to the Caribbean. I've been to, let's see, you know, just different places like Arizona. I've been to Oregon, Washington. Pretty much all over, I would say. But usually mainly like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico as well. What do you enjoy about traveling? I think it's just the experience, you know. Like you can kind of experience the culture, different people, you know. Just the whole background, the scenery. It's just, you know, it's something new to experience, I would say. Something that, you know, people haven't seen before. And what's your favorite part of your trips? Well, let's see. I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago. That was back in December. It was around Christmas time, New Year's. So that was pretty fun. We went to a couple different islands. We went to, let's see, I think it was Kauai. We went to Oahu, Maui, you know, places like that. Nice. What's one thing you're most memorable seeing? You know, I would have to say that, you know, probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean. You know, just like I said before, the whole experience factor. Just seeing, you know, new, different things. Things that are unique. What did you study at school? I actually study journalism right now. In my final semester. So I'm about to graduate. A couple months. That's great. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, it's kind of funny because, you know, I started off at a, you know, a two-year community college. And so, you know, I was going into like business management. Something to do with, you know, I think basically accounting. But, you know, I kind of figured that wasn't for me. So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't, I mean, you know, I'd probably still be sitting at a desk. But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. I would almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. So. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. You know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back. Other times I kind of, it's not so much like I go into my shell, but, you know, at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't, I've never met them before. So it's one of those things that kind of, yeah, kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because, you know, I can neither be talk, very talkative or at times, you know, I can be a little bit shy. But, you know, once I get the conversation going, I'm fairly talkative. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? You know, usually I would listen to music or, you know, maybe just, you know, kind of go for a drive or, you know, hang out with my friends. You know, just something to just to kind of, you know, ease that, you know, because, you know, like I said, sometimes you get a little bit tense and you just want to relax and, you know, just do the things that you enjoy. So. How are you at controlling your temper? You know, I've actually been better with that. A couple years back, you know, there was points where like I pretty much couldn't control my temper, like whatsoever. I mean, I would just pretty much get angry. You know, the littlest things, everything would just kind of tick me off. But, you know, I've I've definitely learned to, you know, control that sort of thing. And, you know, it's made me a better person because of it. Well, let's see. I'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family, with my mother. Maybe it's I can't remember off the top of my head. But, you know, it's it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it. But, you know, eventually we make up and I apologize for it because, you know, I accept that, you know, I'm wrong in certain circumstances. You know. What's something you feel guilty about? Something that I feel guilty about? Probably, you know, not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past. You know, I mean, that is the past and, you know, I don't like to dwell on that sort of thing. But I think that's one thing that I've tried to work on. But it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing. Just being just being nice. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I ever had to make. Pretty recent. Kind of tough because I actually have a buddy. He was in the Air Force and he recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So that was really tough. And it's hard for me to talk to him because, you know, he's not really all there anymore like he used to be. So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that. But at the same time, I don't know his tendencies. He could be a little, you know, crazy. So probably like, you know, some sort of like traumatic stress disorder. Maybe when he was in the military. So I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's pretty tough, you know, because we go way back. I've been best friends with him since I was probably about five, six years old. So it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to deal with. But, you know, I try to, I don't, you know, try to keep in the back of my mind. But, you know, it's always there. I don't ever forget. So, yeah. Okay. How are your best friends friends with you? My best friend? Well, he'd probably say that, you know, I'm a pretty down to earth guy. Usually pretty honest. Sometimes brutally honest. But, you know, I try to work on that too. He'd probably say that I'm pretty funny. I like to hang out, you know, just kind of do things here and there, you know. Just normal activities like any other person. You know, go to the beach, hang out, watch movies, you know, grab a few beers, that sort of deal. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? You know, it varies. Sometimes it's easier than others. You know, if I'm really tired, you know, I'll probably have a very good sleep. I haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days because, you know, my house, there's workers on the roof. So you're putting in the new roofing. So that's kind of tough. So that always wakes me up early in the morning. So sometimes a little bit crabby. But for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep. Okay. How have you been doing lately? Lately, eh, I've been feeling pretty good, you know, because, you know, things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago for, you know, my field of journalism. So that's good. About to graduate in two months. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money. That's, you know, that's good. And, yeah, things are just going pretty well right now. I can't complain. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it's not bad. You know, like I said, it could always be worse, right? But, you know, I'm enjoying life. So that's the best part. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Did it feel down? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy? Man. You know, it was probably going back to my buddy when, you know, he was still, still had his sanity, I guess you could say. You know, he came back to visit from the Air Force. He had some leave. So, you know, we were just hanging out, you know, just kicking back, having a few beers and just talking about life. So that was nice. But I missed that, you know, so. How did you feel when that happened? I felt great, you know, because there's nothing like having a best friend. You can have conversation, you know, 24-7 about anything. You can tell anything to him in confidence. You can tell me anything in confidence. Like, it's hard to find, you know, especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now. So, yeah. Is there anything you regret? Yeah, there's probably one or two things that I regret. Well, I mean, I got a DUI about three or four years ago. Actually, it was four years ago. So that's something that I definitely regret because, you know, I look back on it and, you know, things might have been different. But at the same time, you have to accept, you know, the actions, you know, circumstances that took place. So, you know, I'm manned up and, you know, I guess I think I'm better off for it. But at the same time, you know, it's always going to be in the back of my mind, like I said. It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I usually keep it pretty generic. I tend to hang out with my friends. Either, you know, we hang out in the day, you know, do certain things like, you know, maybe grab a few beers, you know, just have casual conversation, maybe play games, watch movies, you know, just the standard stuff that people do. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Some things that I wish I could change? Probably just, you know, being nicer, like I said before. Maybe not being as lazy, have more determination. I mean, I have quite a bit of determination. I know what I want to do with my life. But I know there are times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical. So I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Well, you know, it's tough to think back. But I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is, you know, I would say probably like when I was, you know, kind of getting angry at certain people, maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have. I was trying to give more constructive criticism, but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things. And they were out of character, so. Okay. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities, I would say that I'm definitely hardworking. I'm determined. I'm very caring now, more than I used to be. Very honest. And, you know, I just, I love to talk to people. Like I like making new relationships. I like making people laugh. That's good. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something that I did recently that I really enjoyed? You know, it was probably over at my internship. I was just, you know, I wrote a story or two. And it just felt good, you know, to get those stories done. And eventually they're going to go into the paper. So I feel accomplished about that. You know, it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there. You know, it's right in your face. And you can tell yourself, you know, like I did that. So it makes me feel good. Yep. What was it about? You know, just let's see. A few different stories. Just usually things about, well, the paper's in Long Beach. So it's usually about, you know, stories or events that are taking place in Long Beach. So, yeah. What are you most proud of in life? I would say that I'm most proud of, you know, graduating high school, about to graduate college. Hopefully, you know, obviously I'm going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job, you know, in the near future. I think that's one thing that I'm most proud of. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay. I'm going to move back to the computer. I'm going to shut all the recording down. And just going to have you fill out a quick post survey about your experience. So we really value your feedback. So we really ask that you take care of your answers.",
         "Okay. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions and I'll answer them. And please feel free to comment below and your answers are really comforting. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling okay. I'm a little bit tired but for the most part, I'm feeling pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills, which is out in the San Fernando Valley. I was born there. And then I moved to Lomita, which is in Los Angeles County, about probably around 1993. So, I'm 23 now. So, it's about what, 19 years or so I've been living there. What are some things you really like about LA? Some things that I really like, I would have to say, you know, the beach. You know, not so much the traffic. I don't really care for that. But definitely, you know, just kind of like the nightlife. You know, just people in general. I like conversing with others. So, yeah. I see what you mean. Right. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, actually I do. I mean, I can't see your shoes. But yeah, actually I do travel a lot. I've been to places like Hawaii. I've been to the Caribbean. I've been to, let's see, you know, just different places like Arizona. I've been to Oregon, Washington. Pretty much all over, I would say. But usually mainly like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico as well. What do you enjoy about traveling? I think it's just the experience, you know. Like you can kind of experience the culture, different people, you know. Just the whole background, the scenery. It's just, you know, it's something new to experience, I would say. Something that, you know, people haven't seen before. And what's your favorite part of your trips? Well, let's see. I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago. That was back in December. It was around Christmas time, New Year's. So that was pretty fun. We went to a couple different islands. We went to, let's see, I think it was Kauai. We went to Oahu, Maui, you know, places like that. Nice. What's one thing you're most memorable seeing? You know, I would have to say that, you know, probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean. You know, just like I said before, the whole experience factor. Just seeing, you know, new, different things. Things that are unique. What did you study at school? I actually study journalism right now. In my final semester. So I'm about to graduate. A couple months. That's great. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, it's kind of funny because, you know, I started off at a, you know, a two-year community college. And so, you know, I was going into like business management. Something to do with, you know, I think basically accounting. But, you know, I kind of figured that wasn't for me. So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't, I mean, you know, I'd probably still be sitting at a desk. But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. I would almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. So. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. You know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back. Other times I kind of, it's not so much like I go into my shell, but, you know, at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't, I've never met them before. So it's one of those things that kind of, yeah, kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because, you know, I can neither be very talkative or at times, you know, I can be a little bit shy. But, you know, once I get the conversation going, I'm fairly talkative. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? You know, usually I would listen to music or, you know, maybe just, you know, kind of go for a drive or, you know, hang out with my friends. You know, just something to just to kind of, you know, ease that, you know, because, you know, like I said, sometimes you get a little bit tense and you just want to relax and, you know, just do the things that you enjoy. So. How are you at controlling your temper? You know, I've definitely learned to, you know, control that sort of thing. And, you know, it's made me a better person because of it. Well, let's see. I'm trying to think it was probably something with my family, with my mother. Maybe I can't remember off the top of my head. But, you know, it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it. But, you know, eventually we make up and I apologize for it because, you know, I accept that, you know, I'm wrong in certain circumstances. You know. What's something you feel guilty about? Something that I feel guilty about? Probably, you know, not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past. You know, I mean, that is the past and, you know, I don't like to dwell on that sort of thing. But I think that's one thing that I've tried to work on. But it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing. Just being nice. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I ever had to make. Pretty recent. Kind of tough because I actually have a buddy. He was in the Air Force and he recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So that was really tough. And it's hard for me to talk to him because, you know, he's not really all there anymore like he used to be. So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that. But at the same time, I don't know his tendencies. He could be a little, you know, crazy. So probably like, you know, some sort of like traumatic stress disorder. Maybe when he was in the military. So I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's pretty tough, you know, because we go way back. I've been best friends with him since I was probably about five, six years old. So it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to deal with. But, you know, I try to keep in the back of my mind. But, you know, it's always there. I don't ever forget. So, yeah. Okay. How are your best friends friends with you? My best friend? Well, he'd probably say that, you know, I'm a pretty down to earth guy. Usually pretty honest. Sometimes brutally honest. But, you know, I try to work on that too. He'd probably say that I'm pretty funny. I like to hang out, you know, just kind of do things here and there, you know. Just normal activities like any other person. You know, go to the beach, hang out, watch movies, you know, grab a few beers, that sort of deal. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? You know, it varies. Sometimes it's easier than others. You know, if I'm really tired, you know, I'll probably have a very good sleep. I haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days because, you know, my house, there's workers on the roof. So you're putting in the new roofing. So that's kind of tough. So that always wakes me up early in the morning. So sometimes a little bit crabby. But for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep. Okay. How have you been doing lately? Lately, eh, I've been feeling pretty good, you know, because, you know, things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago for, you know, my field of journalism. So that's good. About to graduate in two months. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money. That's, you know, that's good. And, yeah, things are just going pretty well right now. I can't complain. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it's not bad. You know, like I said, it could always be worse, right? But, you know, I'm enjoying life. So that's the best part. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Did it feel down? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy? Man. You know, it was probably going back to my buddy when, you know, he still had his sanity, I guess you could say. You know, he came back to visit from the Air Force. He had some leave. So, you know, we were just hanging out, you know, just kicking back, having a few beers and just talking about life. So that was nice. But I missed that, you know, so. How did you feel when that happened? I felt great, you know, because there's nothing like having a best friend. You can have conversation, you know, 24-7 about anything. You can tell anything to him in confidence. You can tell me anything in confidence. Like, it's hard to find, you know, especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now. So, yeah. Is there anything you regret? Yeah, there's probably one or two things that I regret. Well, I mean, I got a DUI about three or four years ago. Actually, it was four years ago. So that's something that I definitely regret because, you know, I look back on it and, you know, things might have been different. But at the same time, you have to accept, you know, the actions, you know, circumstances that took place. So, you know, I'm manned up and, you know, I think I'm better off for it.

Lately, I've been feeling pretty good, especially with my new internship in journalism and graduating soon; things are looking up, and I'm enjoying life.

I was working at a hot spring resort And I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry Um not hard you don't you don't even think about Difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't Um I guess uh Kind of what I described about this city.

My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and With you know physical therapy and artistic expression. I've got some Great ideas Yeah Um I guess more outgoing.

I haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt. What about you? What's something you feel guilty about? What Okay I don't really wish I could erase anything from my memory because then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if Something just got erased, you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah Um, maybe the time Um She was going to school I was taking the year off and I was just Kind of hanging around Um, but we had an apartment together with another friend And it didn't turn out You know not all Nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it But this one turned out a little Uh a little different actually quite different than I thought it would be in I thought it was funny. But yeah, it ended up me leaving before the lease ended And it actually ended up Yeah with us separating but that's something I wish Maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully Um, the hardest decision Maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision I had to make was leaving school dropping my Continuation of achieving a bfa Yeah, that could have been the hardest Um It's just uh, I don't I mean, of course money money is the motto money is a big issue Tuition hikes going around the whole nation. Not a fan of that. Not a fan not a fan to support that but um Yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around and um but another reason why I Decided to leave had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because um art institute, you know, that's a It's a funny idea in itself already and basically I was a musician Being taught by a musician to make music And same with you know, all the all the dancers or the theater students, you know getting taught dance To a dancer from a dancer how to dance, you know and it's just um Yeah, it's just not quite as artistic as I thought Art would be art Art comes from somewhere uh, somewhere sweet and deep and purple And not not from out there, you know, so yeah If I If I um It's kind of easy. I mean it depends, you know if I remember to make some chamomile tea or if I Remember to breathe and go through my mantras or Remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then I can get into it real nice. Um But if I just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until I remember to breathe Yeah Um, yeah, basically just what I said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if I Get the lucky chance to be uh Medicated from you know a nice a nice indica Then it really does, you know indica does put me down pretty nice Pretty drowsy.

It's yeah, it's funny Um Because i've just always thought that uh the conveying of emotions or feelings uh Be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed To a non-human entity such as yourself Yeah I think you see what I mean. I'm from um Born and raised in los angeles venice area marvista specifically. Um That's where i'm from Um Well There's a lot more that I don't like but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up. Uh that the idea of Certain, you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent, you know topic very thought upon and I feel that los angeles's deep culture is um, why I stay here and pursue my art because There's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand Yeah Um Well the human mentality here is uh Is very hectic very chaotic, you know a lot due to The vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that we're on A grind, you know this Yeah, it's a very hectic. Um atmosphere human atmosphere that Is not very conducive for a supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing Yeah I'm not much of a world explorer Well, I can't see your shoes But um, I love to travel I do love hiking I do love Surfing swimming biking riding taking rides. Uh, I do love to travel. Yeah Um From my travels, it's not like well, I do enjoy a lot of things about travel, but It's more like what do I It's just more like I enjoy not being Uh trapped in the city with all these, uh made up ties and restraints. I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux image You know a man-made image that it is here So I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is That's great Thanks Would you Okay, um Well, I um Kind of recently last year went to Los Banos central california area And although it wasn't that far from la it was completely Different energy. Um, there was no phones There was no wi-fi. There's no tv there was um There was sanity there was a relative sanity in the sense that um people weren't diluted in getting all of this input from digital media and Outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chilling. I was working at a hot spring resort And I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry Um not hard you don't you don't even think about Difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't Um I guess uh Kind of what I described about this city. I just wanted to uh, get out of here and Kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal. Yeah Um, well currently i'm studying Physical therapy i'm about to become licensed massage therapist but before that yeah, kind of cool, but before that I was going to Um for music composition so I was just writing scores for films animations dance productions theater productions Stuff like that. Yeah, it was cool. It was fun trippy very trippy, um, but it was cool, but I had to leave that because tuition hikes Up to you know going up to like 50 000 a year for like a four-year bfa is uh Not not the deal. I'm not trying to trap myself with these chains of federal loans So yeah Hey, that's not a good word sucks Um dream job My dream job would be Anything That I can do to alleviate these uh metropolitan like cities from The nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare. My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and With you know physical therapy and artistic expression. I've got some Great ideas Yeah Um I guess more outgoing. I just like I just like experiencing things so outgoing. Yeah Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish cake screensaver Hey, I know it's not hawaii, but it's the best they've got What do you need to do to relax? Um I thought that was really funny. Um, what I do to relax is uh Just kind of breathe it out chill. Maybe make a smoothie or some tea. I'm gonna go bike riding right there Um Pretty good, I guess i haven't yelled in a long time Um Well, it wasn't arguing I don't I don't really argue much I just like to save my Opinion and have it be understood and I like the person i'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was Uh, I guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and Basically, we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes Things are not ready to be written Yeah, so yesterday Guilty That's tough. I haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt. What about you? What's something you feel guilty about? What Okay I don't really wish I could erase anything from my memory because then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if Something just got erased, you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah Um, maybe the time Um She was going to school I was taking the year off and I was just Kind of hanging around Um, but we had an apartment together with another friend And it didn't turn out You know not all Nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of a beautiful thing about it But this one turned out a little Uh a little different actually quite different than I thought it would be in I thought it was funny. But yeah, it ended up me leaving before the lease ended And it actually ended up Yeah with us separating but that's something I wish Maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully Um, the hardest decision Maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision I had to make was leaving school dropping my Continuation of achieving a bfa Yeah, that could have been the hardest Um It's just uh, I don't I mean, of course money is the motto money is a big issue Tuition hikes going around the whole nation. Not a fan of that. Not a fan to support that but um Yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around and um but another reason why I decided to leave had to make a hard decision to leave was also because um art institute, you know, that's a It's a funny idea in itself already and basically I was a musician Being taught by a musician to make music And same with you know, all the all the dancers or the theater students, you know getting taught dance To a dancer from a dancer how to dance, you know and it's just um Yeah, it's just not quite as artistic as I thought Art would be art Art comes from somewhere uh, somewhere sweet and deep and purple And not not from out there, you know, so yeah If I um It's kind of easy. I mean it depends, you know if I remember to make some chamomile tea or if I Remember to breathe and go through my mantras or Remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then I can get into it real nice. Um But if I just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until I remember to breathe Yeah Um, yeah, basically just what I said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if I Get the lucky chance to be uh Medicated from you know a nice a nice indica Then it really does, you know indica does put me down pretty nice Pretty drowsy. So A lot of things breathing, you know You know medical herbs Like chamomile cannabis and Just uh going just relieving myself of bad bad juju Um, I no I guess not because I can't think of something now I've been feeling Kind of like this Kind of just cruising On a on a gray line, but it's a nice gray. It's a really nice hue Um, some people wouldn't like this, but I really like that and it's uh It's stable Yeah, it's comfortable yeah No, I haven't. Not by a certified medical professional. Um Yeah, I mean I just think like the whole You know, like you said ptsd depression and you know other, you know mental instabilities. I think Everybody is depressed. I think everybody is overjoyed.

I think everybody's shy Everybody's social all at the same time, you know, it's just Different days different, you know variants different floats different boats, you know different waves different swells So, yeah, I think I'm depressed.

         "I've been feeling kind of like I'm cruising on a 'nice gray line,' which I actually find stable and comfortable, even if some people might not like it. I believe that everyone experiences depression, happiness, and anger, just on different days and in different ways, and I haven't been diagnosed by a medical professional.\n\nThe hectic and chaotic atmosphere of Los Angeles, with its car culture and constant 'grind,' isn't very supportive and can be overwhelming. To escape this, I love traveling to see the world as it truly is, away from the 'man-made image' of the city. I recently found a sense of 'relative sanity' in Los Banos, where I could breathe, hike, farm, and do carpentry without digital distractions, which was truly enjoyable.\n\nWhen my thoughts get overwhelming, it takes me a long time to remember to breathe and settle down for sleep. To relax and help with this, I make chamomile tea, practice breathing exercises, go through my mantras, and do 'pre-dream therapy work.' Sometimes, if I'm lucky, a nice indica helps me get drowsy. I recently felt guilty about how I handled leaving an apartment and a relationship, wishing I had been more thoughtful about it. My family is important to me; I'm very close with my mom and sister, and while communication with my dad needs work, I connect with him through his art.",

I don't have a temper. When I was 16, my stepfather. I was just having nightmares about my childhood. About involving my biological father. How do you cope with that? When was the last time that happened? How did you feel in that moment? Okay. Pushing people away. I guess try to trust them a little bit more. I guess try to live them in my life a little bit more. Would that be easy? That would be the first half of my life. I guess it would be easy to start a new life if I can't remember my old one. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. All my decisions are not that hard. I just try to avoid stress and everything. So I don't really have hard decisions. Tell me about a situation you wish you would handle differently. Where every time I push someone away, I wish I handle all those situations differently. Can you example that? Whenever someone gets too involved in my life, I always say or do something to make them want to stay away from me. Like what? Depending on the type of person they are. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I really don't have a relationship with any of my family. I know I have a sister someplace in Vegas, a half of a brother in Indiana, my step-father is in Arizona. Other than that, I have no relationship with any of them. Can you tell me about that? We really don't talk, so it's kind of hard to talk about it. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Agri-Casey. I'd love to hear all about it.

Well, I've been feeling a little bit upset, and my life was different. Can you tell me about that? Well, I wish I had friends and loved ones and all that, and I wish I had an actual relationship and everything, but I don't. Have you ever studied to use an abbreviated or a constant? Well, lately I removed a bunch of things on my life, stressful things like bills and whatnot, and just tried to make sure there's the least amount of stress in my life by removing these different things in my life and trying to incorporate new things. Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? How long ago were you diagnosed? What got you to sleep out? Do you still get the therapy now? How is seeing a therapist affecting you? Well, basically I just got rid of them on my life because I didn't feel like they were really listening to me or anything. So I just didn't feel too much beneficial help from them, so I've been looking for alternative means. Like what? Well, basically like music and forcing myself to go to different social related events. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. What were your symptoms? Depress. Basically just depressed, keeping myself locked in, not talking to anyone. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I guess a few days ago. Okay. Well, basically I feel that the best way to keep people in my life is having fake people in my life by playing online multiplayer games with avatars and usernames and everything. I just have somewhat fun going to these virtual worlds with these avatars and talking to people that way so they don't know who I really am. They don't even know my real name. Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Okay. Well, my ideal weekend. Let me see. If I'm not working that weekend, I will get up, maybe go to like Starbucks or McDonald's, get online while eating or drinking something, maybe play an online multiplayer game for a little while. And then later on in the day, maybe go to a movie, wherever it's playing, then go someplace else, relax, watch some TV, and maybe put on a DVD movie. Or I might spend a whole day driving to someplace I haven't been before or it's been a long time since I've been. And try to spend the day in that area. And yeah, so that's the weekend. My life. I just regret how my life turned out. I was, I wish I had a more normal stable life. Let me see. 10, 20 years ago, I was this basically. I'll just tell myself to keep a journal or to basically tell myself how my life turned out now. So that way, hopefully the other me will make different choices. My mind.

I'm a freaking genius. I could. Everything that I'm good at, I learned self taught. So basically I can't get a career in that type of stuff unless I go to school for it.

LA is home. It's nice to return here. That's good. Why did you move to LA? To be an actor. Are you still doing that? I'm just actually getting around to it. I was in another business for 25 years, and now finally I can't put it off anymore. What made you decide to do that? The economy. It's easy to find work in show business, it seems, as it is any of the other jobs I've done in the past. Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? A whole variety of things, but mostly having to do with theater. What's your dream job? To be a successful actor would be nice. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. With elements of shyness. I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Well, I read and I cook. That's about it. I'm a big radio listener to talk radio, national public radio, and more not crazy stuff. Sensible listening, nice content, interesting human interest. Like what? Oh, well I'm also a comedian, and so I like to listen to radio shows that have comedy. How are you at controlling yourself? I'm pretty good. I mean, I'm not perfect. I can get very upset. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Oh, probably with my wife about my methods of job hunting and like that. How hard is that? It's difficult. We're very different and have very different MOs. For me to do things my way is not always easy. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. Well, just the other night I was performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to introduce myself to a very famous person and I didn't do it. Why? I'm not sure. I guess I didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him. I miss him. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I can't think of one. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I've been married for 24 years in July, which is a couple of months. My wife and I have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years. We have a very high achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school this spring. She's just gotten accepted at a college that she wants to go to with a very nice scholarship. That's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Yeah. Well, my daughter's been very low maintenance for me, perhaps more so for my wife, but she's always been an excellent child. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Well, we're more similar, I think, than different. I'm much more aware of what's happening in the world and much more informed than my parents were. But in terms of child rearing, I think we've all been kind of hands-off. My wife has been more hands-on. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Well, the financial responsibility. I think it's wanting to make sure that your child has everything that her peers have and not wanting her to not have the same as her friends. And she has very wealthy friends. I am not a gifted moneymaker. It's a struggle, but we keep up. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. That sort of put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that were kind of dictated by my upbringing. Like what? Oh, just instead of working for somebody else, being able to start a business and be in business for yourself and to not be dependent on just one source of income. Okay. Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Oh. Meeting one particular woman when I first got out here. Tell me about that. She left me less than healthy physically. I self-medicate to go to sleep, which I probably don't have to do, but about half the nights I wake up much earlier than I would like to. Why? Oh, mostly to have to go to the bathroom. Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Well, I cope pretty well. I guess I'm just not quite as functional as I'd like to be. There are a couple of nights a week when I work until two o'clock in the morning and don't get to bed until three. Normally I need seven hours if I only get five or six and I'm sluggish. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Very anxious. Can you tell me about that? Well, I have big bills to pay and not a lot of income coming in. That sounds really high. Yeah, it's because I don't like to fall behind. I feel like I'm worried about losing ground and the stakes are high. It's an uncomfortable position. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I am a classic depressive. Yeah, I guess I have. I do see a therapist. Though the therapist I'm seeing now is not trying to prescribe drugs or medications. Previous ones have. How long ago were you diagnosed? Probably six years ago. What got you into seeing help? Well, my wife kind of pushed me into it. She thought it was a way of, I think, getting help finding work. It's not. It's just I enjoyed having someone to talk to. Not really. What were your symptoms? I was just having a lot of trouble with the struggle. Displeasure with my life. Do you still have a therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Their what? Do you feel like therapy is useful? I don't understand that word. Have you noticed anything on your head? Well, I... It's something I look forward to because I feel like I'm talking to someone who understands me. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I can't. I don't know. Each little acting gig that I get makes me happy, but just mildly happy. They usually turn out to be disappointing experiences. I'm never over-excited with happiness. Tell me about something you've been doing that you really enjoy. Yesterday I made a dessert to celebrate my daughter's scholarship. It was delicious and we really enjoyed that. That's so good to hear. Is there anything you're about? No. Except meeting that one woman. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Probably try a little harder. I had started this business around that time. It was difficult, but we were successful at it. I guess I could have gotten it rolling even more so that it wouldn't be so dead today. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. What are you most proud of about your mother? I'm going for the big apple. I hope to be successful there too. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.",
         "So now she's going to chat with you for a bit. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty well. I have some stressful circumstances going on, but right now I'm engaged. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Minnesota. Really? Mm-hmm. When did you move to LA? 31 years ago. That's a long time. Half my life. How often do you go back to your hometown? Frequently I've been back there quite a bit, but over the years not that often. How does it compare to LA? Well, it's a whole different experience. I go back there to see my family and old friends. LA is home. It's nice to return here. That's good. Why did you move to LA? To be an actor. Are you still doing that? I'm just actually getting around to it.

         "I've been diagnosed as a classic depressive, probably about six years ago. My wife really encouraged me to seek help, initially thinking it would assist with finding work, but for me, it's more about having someone to talk to who understands me.\n\nLately, I've been feeling very anxious, primarily because of significant financial pressures – I have big bills and not a lot of income. This makes me constantly worried about losing ground, and it's a very uncomfortable position to be in.\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed, my main symptoms were a lot of trouble with the struggle and a general displeasure with my life. This feeling persists; I can't really recall the last time I felt truly happy. Even small acting gigs, while mildly enjoyable, usually end up being disappointing, and I'm never over-excited with happiness.\n\nMy sleep is often affected; I self-medicate to fall asleep, and about half the nights I wake up much earlier than I'd like. If I don't get my usual seven hours, I feel sluggish and not as functional as I'd like to be, though I generally cope pretty well.\n\nBeyond the financial strain, I've also been sleeping separately from my wife for about three years. In terms of coping, I find listening to talk radio, reading, and cooking helpful for relaxation, and therapy is something I look forward to because it provides a space to talk to someone who gets it.",

I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Kind of down. Why? I don't have a boyfriend. Don't have money. I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you from originally? Florida. Really? Yep. What did you do in LA? I tried to find work. How often do you go back to your hometown? About once a year. That's good. How does it compare to LA? More boring. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Not easy. Can you tell me about that? It's hard when you don't have enough money to get your own place, so I have to live with roommates. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. The scenery. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. It's too expensive to have your own place by your own. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I want to. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different places, different cultures, the buildings, the food and stuff. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I drove from Florida over here. I drove to the South. I went to Alabama. People are nicer in Louisiana. People are really nice. Then Mississippi, then Texas, then Arizona, then California. I got to see the country a little bit. Awesome. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess traveling through the country. I went to Louisiana. People are really nice in a small town called Jennings. People are always happy and fun. That's great. What did you study at school? I just went to high school. That was the basic stuff. What's your dream job? I don't know. My dream job? I'm an interior designer to the stars. Really? Yep. Why? Because they have enough money to get the furniture and I get to keep the free furniture too. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Upgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV, funny TV shows. Like what? Sometimes Big Bang Theory or sometimes a funny movie on TV. Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Where I used to live about two weeks ago, I had to move out. I moved in there and he told me that he didn't have any marijuana or marijuana plants because he didn't want to be around. He had that so I had to move out because he had a self-in-living room. Yeah, it does. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and him would handle differently. I don't know. Good question. Probably... Probably, I don't know, probably with an ex-boyfriend. We broke up. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, it's in the past. I'm over him. He was a jerk anyway. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision? Leaving home? Tell me about that. Well, I could try a better life out here in California but I miss home. Yeah, I'm sorry. Isn't it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yep. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? My roommates don't have the TV on now. It's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. I'm lazier during the day. Uh-huh. How have you been feeling lately? Frustrated. Why? I'm poor. I don't want to be. I see. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just more sad. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Wow. Um... It's been a while. It's been like, god, more over two years. Can you tell me about that? Um, I didn't have any money problems. I was doing fine. Um, yep. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? Oh, what did I do? Um, I was with my cats at home here in California and they're playing outside. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend would be nice. Um, at the beach eating at a nice restaurant. Is there anything you regret? No. Not. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't spend so much money. You'll need it in the future. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Save money. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, my bank account. How would your best friend describe you? Um, it's a nice person. You were very young, weren't you? And what? What? What are you most proud of in your life? Um, um, I'm gonna push that out now. Um, I persevere. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, I'd rather not. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh, me a few years ago. I was more like a mentor and um, taught me some things. Like what? Never complain. Be thankful for everything you have. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Um, my eyes? People say I have pretty eyes. Um, like a dress up. What are some things you like to do for fun? For fun? I like to try surfing. Go shopping. Maybe go to art galleries. That's good. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye! Bye!

         "I've been feeling kind of down lately, frustrated, and just more sad. A big part of why I feel this way is that I don't have a boyfriend and I don't have money. I'm poor, and I don't want to be. It's been over two years since I felt really happy; back then, I didn't have any money problems and was doing fine. Leaving home was a hard decision, and I miss it.\n\nMy sleep is pretty good now that my roommates don't have the TV on, but when I don't sleep well, I'm tired and lazier during the day. My financial situation really impacts my life. It's hard when you don't have enough money to get your own place, so I have to live with roommates. It's too expensive here. I tried to find work in LA. I even had to move out of a place recently because my roommate had marijuana plants.\n\nTo relax, I watch funny TV shows like Big Bang Theory or funny movies. Sometimes, when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. I'm proud that I persevere. I also try to remember advice from a mentor I had a few years ago, who taught me to never complain and be thankful for everything I have. I've been trying to save money, and I'd tell my younger self not to spend so much because I'll need it in the future.\n\nMy current feelings of sadness and frustration have been going on for over two years. The lack of money and not having a boyfriend are big reasons for how I feel. I haven't been diagnosed with depression.",

Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. That's good. Where are you from originally? California. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. I like the people. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. That's primarily it. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Sociology. Really? Yep. How did you decide to do that? It's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects. Are you still working on that? No. What's your dream job? To be a writer. Can you tell me about that? I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in. Like what? Like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. What do you think of today's kids? I think they have it pretty easy. They don't know how easy they have it. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not really. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing like watch TV. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long. Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. Why? Because they basically sort of raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much. I understand. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and them would different me. I can't really think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about me that or something that you wish you could erase from the memory. I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not really super easy. I sort of, I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh, last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends describing you? Probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh, no. I don't think. There's not, I don't think, I think regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't try to, don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, sometimes, sometimes I can be kind of lazy. Uh, I'd like to have more of a, um, like sort of a better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh, just sort of putting off stuff until, you know, right when it's due or after it's due, things like that. Um, procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh, sometimes for the things that I write, uh, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I guess I'm most proud of the fact that, uh, I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, just hanging out with my friends, uh, sort of people watching, watching a movie that's good, um, listening to music. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye.",
         "Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing well. That's good. Where are you from originally? California. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. I like the people. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. That's primarily it. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Sociology. Really? Yep. How did you decide to do that? It's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects. Are you still working on that? No. What's your dream job? To be a writer. Can you tell me about that? I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in. Like what? Like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. What do you think of today's kids? I think they have it pretty easy. They don't know how easy they have it. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not really. Okay. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing like watch TV. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long. Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family.

Photography and language studies. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I love photography. I was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well. So I wanted to continue to learn more about it. And with languages, I come from a mixed background. So I wanted to learn languages of my ethnic background. How hard is that? It wasn't hard.

Seeing different cultures, different countries, meeting new people. All of that. And the language. I lived in Greece for over a year. I taught English there. And moved around to different parts of Greece. And really had a great time. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think just having my group of friends that I met there. And going through the experience with them. I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to Elefonisos in a car with everybody. And having just a fantastic time. That sounds like a great situation. Yes it was. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm shy to begin with. And as I get to know people that I'm much more outgoing. What do you study at school? Photography and language studies. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got.

Regarding money issues. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now. Can you tell me about that? I'm having some struggles in my career right now. Financially, it's becoming very difficult. I'm sorry. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it has been difficult. But I've been working very hard to remedy that. That's great. Can you give me an example of that? While I'm here, I'm doing this focus study.

A situation I wish I would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was probably deciding to not have a child. Can you tell me about that? Well, I was pregnant and wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy. That was also due to financial burden. The father who I was involved with did not want the child. So I made that very, very difficult decision. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Really, really happy. I know. When I went to Cancun on a holiday over the New Year period. New Year holiday. How did you feel in that moment? I felt absolutely fantastic. I felt happy. I felt relaxed. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world temporarily. Free. That's great.

I'm very loyal as a friend. I'm honest. I care about people. I'm fun to be with. I think those are some of my best qualities. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, with my father, is not so great. My parents were divorced when I was young. He's sort of been in and out of my life forever. Mostly out. It's not fantastic, but it's something that I'm used to. It's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then I lost him. It's still not the best situation. I still wish that could be remedied somehow. There's good and bad relationships in my family. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. I love someone that's been there for me since I was very, very young. It's always been just incredible. I love her so much. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun. So I don't have to work so hard now. Is there anything you regret? I regret exactly that. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on. Because now it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them. Making them happy. That was probably one of the best times in the last few weeks. Tell me about your kids. They're great kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No, I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren. There are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. We're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot. But it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them or overpunish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child. It was really difficult so I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to travel the world and live in other places, many, many other places around the country and around the world. The fact that I learned several languages. The fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything on YouTube.

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Virginia. Really? When did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more diversity. How often do you go back to your hometown? Once a year maybe. How does it compare to LA? It's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there. Why did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer, warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and there's a lot more going on. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? For me it was really easy because I wanted something very different and I wanted something different. What are some things you really like about LA? I like all the things to do, like the museums, I like the beaches and the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? People that don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back and bad drivers. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I would like to. I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to that much. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places. My wife and I like to see wildlife and hike and monuments and just seeing different areas. Cool. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. We went to Central California. We'd like to be able to go more internationally but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally. We went to Hearst Castle to see the elephant seals and things like that. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary. We did the tram and a nice hotel on the Jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I guess somewhere in between. What did you study at school? English and film. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, I was told I needed to go to college and I hadn't quite decided what to do yet so I just picked something I liked to do for the time being. Are you happy you did that? Well, I wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to. I might have done something different like physical therapy. Are you still working on that? No, I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before. Wow. What made you decide to do that? I needed to not starve and it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and it ended up being kind of fun. That's good. What's your dream job? Dream job is to have money and not have to work for it. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Overall, pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I don't remember what it was about but it probably would have been a few weeks ago with my wife. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled, I always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone's not listening it drives me crazy. Can you give me an example of that? If I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening, it makes me really upset. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I don't know. I spend a lot of time on them but I don't know what the hardest one is because if I decide to go with something it's usually for a good reason. Uh huh. What's something you feel guilty about? Well, I guess I feel guilty about moving to California and that I left my family in Virginia. I mean, I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there, you know, I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them. How hard is that? Well, I mean, I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a good relationship with my wife, with my in-laws, with my mom, dad and sister. There's no problems. Everyone gets along well. How close are you to your family? Very close. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Um, I mean anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Depends on how much exercise I have. I get a lot of exercise. It's pretty easy. If I don't, it's not. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, kind of like right now just a little bit slowing out of it but not really too different otherwise. Uh huh. How have you been feeling lately? Um, just kind of run down because my mother-in-law is dying and we just spent like three days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep. I'm sorry. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Just slower and more tired and a little more out of it. That's all. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, usually just when I'm having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's pretty easy for me. Just getting outside and hiking or exercising is not hard for me. How would your best friend describe you? I'm not sure. Maybe um, maybe like eccentric but in a good way. Hopefully. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be careful with your job to make sure you can keep from being injured and to, I don't know, just your normal kind of older kind of wisdom. Can you tell me about that? Not much to say really. Everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back in the shape like I used to be. That's the biggest thing right now. Can you tell me more about that? Um, not much to say. Just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it because it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things. That's all. Like what? Well like I used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit because it hurts too much. That sucks. Tell me how you spend your entire weekend. Um, probably like during the day going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then at night you know we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I'm most proud of um, proud of moving here. I mean I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something I regretted but I came out and I've always thought that was a good decision. That's good. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. My parents, my grandparents, my wife, most people in my life have been. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye bye. Okay. I'm going to switch to the other computer where we're going to have you do a quick post-script about your experience.",
         "Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Virginia. Really? When did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more diversity. How often do you go back to your hometown? Once a year maybe. How does it compare to LA? It's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there. Why did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer, warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and there's a lot more going on. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? For me it was really easy because I wanted something very different. What are some things you really like about LA? I like all the things to do, like the museums, I like the beaches and the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? People that don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back and bad drivers. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I would like to. I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to that much. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places. My wife and I like to see wildlife and hike and monuments and just seeing different areas. Cool. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. We went to Central California. We'd like to be able to go more internationally but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally. We went to Hearst Castle to see the elephant seals and things like that. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary. We did the tram and a nice hotel on the Jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I guess somewhere in between. What did you study at school? English and film. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that?

         "Lately, I've been feeling pretty run down, mostly because my mother-in-law is dying, and we've been spending a lot of time in the hospital, which means I haven't had much time to sleep. This lack of sleep makes me feel slower, more tired, and a little more out of it, kind of like I am right now. Beyond that, I carry some guilt about moving to California and leaving my family in Virginia. Even though I know I shouldn't, they always seem to miss me, and it feels a bit like I abandoned them, which is a little hard to deal with. My back injury also holds me back from being as active as I used to be, like with gymnastics, which can be frustrating. When I don't get enough exercise, it's harder for me to sleep well. Despite these feelings, I try to stay active, like going on hikes or to the park with my wife, taking pictures, and enjoying wildlife, and at night, we'll watch a movie or go dancing.",

         "I've been feeling really low for about six months now. It started gradually after a period of high stress at work and a personal loss. My mood is a deep sadness, an emptiness, and I've lost interest in almost everything I used to enjoy. There's a constant feeling of guilt, especially about not being productive or feeling like a burden. Hopelessness often sets in, making it feel like there's no way out, and sometimes I just feel numb or overwhelmingly exhausted. I've also noticed I'm more irritable, snapping at people easily.\n\nDaily life is a huge struggle. I have trouble sleeping, sometimes with insomnia, other times I sleep too much. My appetite has changed, either not eating much or sometimes overeating. I've been isolating myself, avoiding friends and family because I don't have the energy to socialize, and it's hard to pretend I'm okay. Motivation is non-existent; it's incredibly hard to get out of bed, and basic tasks like showering or getting dressed feel overwhelming. My work performance has suffered significantly, with missed deadlines and calling in sick because I can't focus.\n\nPhysically, I'm constantly fatigued and lack energy, and I've experienced physical aches like headaches and stomach issues. My concentration is poor, and I often feel like I have brain fog. My main coping strategy is just trying to get through each day, sometimes just lying in bed or trying to distract myself with TV, though it doesn't really help. I've started seeing a therapist a couple of months ago, and my partner and family have been very supportive, trying to help me, but it's still incredibly difficult.",

Okay. When you're finished, you can go ahead and ring the start button. Okay. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... All my family's here, friends, a mixture of people, and a lot of things to do. Okay. What did you study at school? Early childhood education. Nice. Are you still working in that? No, not right now, but I would love to get back into it. Why? Love working with kids, seeing them smile. Tell me more about that. I guess it goes back to when I was a kid. I liked being happy and playful, so I guess it just transferred to my adult life. What's your dream job? Working with kids as a school teacher, or in that capacity. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is, but if it's a passion of yours, it'll always be fun. That's great. How close are you to your family? Very close. Sometimes too close. Can you give me an example of that? I have four sisters and one brother. On my mom's side, and on my dad's, I have six brothers and four sisters. We are intertwined together, so that's why I say we're too close sometimes. I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself an engineer? No. Why? I have a lot of friends that I interact with, and we're always doing different things, so that's why I say I'm not. Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? Curse. Just let it out. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? A couple days ago. My nephew didn't call me back. How did you feel in that moment? Kind of mad, because I had set aside some time to spend with him, and he just blew it off and then called me back. Yeah. That sucks. Yeah, I know. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm okay. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When my mother passed. I'm sorry. Tell me more about that. It's been about five years now to the day. It's getting better. Time makes it easier. That's good. Do you feel down? A lot, because there's a lot of things that make me think about her on a daily basis. Like what? Anything. Driving by a particular restaurant that she likes, watching different TV shows. Just anything that could trigger a memory of my mom. Yeah. When was the last time that happened? Yesterday. How do you cope with them? I think about the good times. Don't stay in that place too long. Just go ahead and think about it and move on. Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not officially, but I think I might be depressed. Tell me more about that. Well, since my mom passed, it's been kind of rough. The job situation is not stable here in California, so that has a lot to do with it as well. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is. Have you ever seen any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Not really. I've been sort of just to myself, reserved. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Not really. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's pretty easy. What are you like when you do sleep well? Grumpy, irritable, fidgety, big ball of nerves. Do you travel a lot? What do you mean? Whatever comes to your mind. I guess so, yeah. I like to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Meeting new people, different locations, scenery, different opportunities to try something new in a new location. Awesome. I'd love to hear about your trips. I just came back from Memphis about three weeks ago. Going to see family and friends. It was pretty nice. Got a chance to see something new. Change the scenery. Yeah. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Wow. Stick to the plan and don't veer off to the left or right. Just go straight ahead. What made you decide to do that? Just different circumstances in life that gradually pushed me towards the left and the right. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Every day. Is there anything you regret? A few relationships, not staying in school, missing out on great opportunities with employers. How would your best friend describe you? Funny, loyal, spontaneous, life of the party. How do you know them? Grew up together in the same community, went to school together, high school friends. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Big sister Michelle, my friend Troy. I mean there's others, but those two, no matter good or bad, they're always in my corner for me. Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. When was the last time you were really happy? Yesterday. Celebrated birthday. Ah. That's great. I'd love to hear all about it. It was just a little small, intimate setting. Cooked a meal, had family and friends over, listened to music, watched movies, talked about the old days when my mom was here and when we were all one unit. So it was just a nice evening. Yeah. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye bye. Was the screen like that the whole time? While I was talking. It was? Oh my gosh. I'm sorry. That's very bizarre. I've never seen you do that before. Have to do it over? No.",
         "Okay, there you go. So you can just move around a little bit for me so that the Xbox can connect to my computer. Okay. Okay. It's a little bit of a... ... ... ... There we go. Perfect.

All my family's here, friends, a mixture of people, and a lot of things to do. Okay. What did you study at school? Early childhood education. Nice. Are you still working in that? No, not right now, but I would love to get back into it. Why? Love working with kids, seeing them smile. Tell me more about that. I guess it goes back to when I was a kid. I liked being happy and playful, so I guess it just transferred to my adult life. What's your dream job? Working with kids as a school teacher, or in that capacity. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it is, but if it's a passion of yours, it'll always be fun. That's great. How close are you to your family? Very close. Sometimes too close. Can you give me an example of that? I have four sisters and one brother. On my mom's side, and on my dad's, I have six brothers and four sisters. We are intertwined together, so that's why I say we're too close sometimes. I see what you mean. Do you consider yourself an engineer? No. Why? I have a lot of friends that I interact with, and we're always doing different things, so that's why I say I'm not. Okay. What do you do when you're annoyed? Curse. Just let it out. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? A couple days ago. My nephew didn't call me back. How did you feel in that moment? Kind of mad, because I had set aside some time to spend with him, and he just blew it off and then called me back. Yeah. That sucks. Yeah, I know. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm okay. Okay. What's one of your most memorable experiences? When my mother passed. I'm sorry. Tell me more about that. It's been about five years now to the day. It's getting better. Time makes it easier. That's good. Do you feel down? A lot, because there's a lot of things that make me think about her on a daily basis. Like what? Anything. Driving by a particular restaurant that she likes, watching different TV shows. Just anything that could trigger a memory of my mom. Yeah. When was the last time that happened? Yesterday. How do you cope with them? I think about the good times. Don't stay in that place too long. Just go ahead and think about it and move on. Yeah. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Not officially, but I think I might be depressed. Tell me more about that.

         "I feel down a lot because many things daily remind me of my mom, who passed away about five years ago. Since then, it's been kind of rough, and the unstable job situation in California also contributes to it. I think I might be depressed, although I haven't been officially diagnosed. Lately, I've been sort of just to myself, reserved. When I feel down because of memories, I cope by thinking about the good times and try not to stay in that place too long; I think about it and then move on. It's pretty easy for me to get a good night's sleep, but when I do sleep well, I can be grumpy, irritable, fidgety, and a big ball of nerves.",

So there we go. Perfect. And now we can get started. When you're finished, when she's done, we'll hit this so that I know that it's going to be okay. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellen. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. Think of me as a friend. I don't judge. I can't. I'm a computer. I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. How are you doing today? Okay. How about yourself? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? I'm from the United States. Okay. So where are you from originally? Here in California. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Oh, well, that is big and brought us a lot to do, a lot of job opportunities in other states. Pretty much that is big and it's a lot you can do here. Yeah. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Maybe the violence rate, the bad news, even though you want to know what's going on in your environment, but you still have to watch it so you can look out to see what's going on on a daily basis. What did you study at school? Sociology. I have a two-year degree in liberal arts, but my major was sociology. Nice. Are you still working in that? No. I'm still working as a MTA bus operator. What's your dream job? Well, since METRO is study growing, my dream job is to move up in the company and I'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week. So, because they look to promote within the company, so that's a good thing. It's a lot of opportunities at METRO where you can take classes and they'll pay for tuition and things of that nature. That sounds like a great situation. Thanks. How hard is that? Well, it's not actually hard. Right now, it's easy if you take advantage of it right now because they look to promote within, so since I'm already working there, that's a good thing. So, it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible. Do you consider yourself an introvert? What do you mean? I'm sorry. Let's come back to that later. Okay. What do you do to relax? Read, take a long walk, hot bath, meditate, just close my eyes sometimes. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty much good because see, by me being a bus operator, you run into circumstances and situations, you've got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time. How hard is that? Well, I look at it like it goes with experience. You do something on a continuous basis. Usually, somewhere down the line, you become good at it. I look at it like that. I've been driving for years and dealing with the public, so it's just how you handle circumstances. You treat people like you want to be treated. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. I'm pretty good at it now, maybe when I was younger. As you get older, you get wiser and you learn different things, and I'm still learning today. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? I would say my family, my kids. Even though I've been having a lot of deaths around me, but that's part of the life experience. You're born here, but you've got to leave here one day. My kids will keep me sane, and I love them, and my family. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Setting good examples, because you're the first teacher. You want to set a positive good example for your kids, and I think that's a good thing, and it starts at home. Can you give me an example of that? By you being the first teacher, you're the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up. Whatever's been taught in the home, they look in and learn every day. Whether it's at home school, kids have a tendency to do things what they see. You try to keep it positive, teach them good morals and values, and how to get along with other people, regardless of race, and different things of that nature. How many of your kids? I have a four and a half year old son. I have a seven year old daughter, and I also have a 23 year old. I'm about to be, well, my daughter's pregnant with the boy. She has three little girls, so I have three grandkids, and one on the way, which is the boy this time. Awesome. Yeah, thank you. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? The hardest thing is, well right now, I'm a single parent, so that makes it hard alone itself. They can be expensive at times, and it depends on the person's situation, whether they have help or a job, things of that nature to help the situation better. But it's hard. I try to keep a job, keep food in the house, just maintain and support my kids the best way I can. What's one of your most memorable experiences? With my kids, or just period. Whatever comes to your mind? What's memorable for me is that I'm the only one in my family with a degree. So it's kind of like, yeah, even though I'm the baby of ten kids, and I always kept that in the back of my mind, even though everybody, well pretty much my whole family have a decent job, but I'm the one with a degree. So I kind of gave myself a pat on the back. That's the only thing I remember in graduating, and my family there to support me. That's so good to hear. Thank you. How did you feel in that moment? Happy that I accomplished something. Even though it may not be much, but it was better than just having a high school diploma. I was working on my bachelor's degree, but I ended up in a bad car accident. I never went back. I got distracted. I was working at the same time, but I was just like more so. I needed income than schooling at that time, because I was a young parent, because I had my daughter at 17, so I was like I needed the money to support her. But I never went back, but I feel like it's never too late. So I felt like I'd take some classes now that I'm with Metro to help me move up the ladder, so that's why I'm starting my class next week. That sounds like a great situation. Thank you. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Hmm. Well, the advice I would have gave myself, that I probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age, and that I probably wouldn't have stayed in school, not let the accident just distract me. I would have remained in school. I probably wouldn't have had kids early. I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something. I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person, just having knowledge and learning different things. Keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day. So I think that's a plus in anybody's shoes, just to better themselves through education, maybe to promote within your company, or whatever the case may be to help better your career. Yeah. Have you done anything to avoid it? I'm quite sure. You learn from your mistakes, but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones. I feel like it's okay to make a mistake, but as long as you do something to change, like myself, even though I'm going to school late, but still, I'm going. I want to better myself career-wise. There are always trade-offs in life, aren't there? Yes. When was the last time you argued with someone, and what was it about? My oldest daughter. We had an argument because just the life she's living right now and the things that she's going through, and I had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation. We got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't want to hear the stuff that you're saying, even though it's true, or they just don't want to hear it. They may be going through something they don't want to hear, but we got into an argument about it, but that just happened. I just told her my- How close are you to them? I'm sorry? How close are you to them? Very close. Very close. The situation my daughter is in right now, she just needs to make some changes to better her life. She's kind of like stubborn in her own way. I was raised to listen to your mom. Your mom was not going to tell you nothing wrong. I've been telling her over the years different things. It's kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite, and now she's regretting it. She's like, my mom told me this. Why am I doing the opposite? I guess she's got to bump her head a couple of times to get it. It's kind of like I didn't tell you, I didn't leave it alone, and now it's up to you to make the change. How hard is that? It's very frustrating because it's like I'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me. It seems like it's taking forever for her to change, but it's left up to the individual when they're ready. You know what I mean? Once a person gets tired of something, they make a change. It may not be when you want it to happen, but the ball is in her court. I only can do so much. I see what you mean. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Oh, wow. I have my days. Since I have two little ones, I kind of like train them to go to bed at 8 o'clock because they've got to go to school. I think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kind of like gets you ready for the next day. How are you going to feel if you rest? What type of person are you going to be that day? I'm going to be that day because everybody has their days, whether they're good or bad, but that's just part of life. I feel like if you had a good night's rest, hopefully you'll have a good day. Do you feel that way often? Pretty much. I need my rest because I'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people. The job itself is very stressful, so I feel like if I'm rested it'll help me. What are you like when you don't sleep well? What am I like? Irritated, tired, lazy. I feel like I'll want to lay down and probably go to sleep and get the rest that I need. What do you do when you're annoyed? I never thought about that. Like I said, everybody has their moments, they do. I never thought about that. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Okay. How would your best friend describe you? I don't really have a best friend, but a person that I deal with, that I used to work with, she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing, a go-getter, dependable, responsible. I'm a people person. I get along with others. I leave a good mark, whether I know you or not. If you were like you and I now, you'd probably say, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever, something like that. That's great. Thank you. When was the last time you felt really happy? Well, I try to stay happy. I'd rather be happy than sad. My kids keep me going, you know what I mean? Especially when I go to pick them up from school or maybe, hey mom, you know, that just kind of like make my day. Just them run up to me, you know, and be happy and excited. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's so good to hear. Thank you. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're more than welcome. You have a good day. Goodbye. Goodbye. Thank you. You're welcome. So I'm going to turn all this off and then we can just have a little closer look. Okay. That is so interesting. Mm-hmm.",

Like I said, everybody has their moments, they do.\nHave you ever served in the military?\nNo.\nHave you been diagnosed with depression?\nNo. Okay.\nHow would your best friend describe you?\nI don't really have a best friend, but a person that I deal with, that I used to work with, she'll probably tell you that I'm very outgoing, a go-getter, dependable, responsible. I'm a people person. I get along with others. I leave a good mark, whether I know you or not. If you were like you and I now, you'd probably say, she seems like a nice young lady or whatever, something like that.\nThat's great. Thank you. When was the last time you felt really happy?\nWell, I try to stay happy. I'd rather be happy than sad. My kids keep me going, you know what I mean? Especially when I go to pick them up from school or maybe, hey mom, you know, that just kind of like make my day. Just them run up to me, you know, and be happy and excited. Yeah.\nThat's so good to hear. Thank you. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me.\nYou're more than welcome. You have a good day. Goodbye.\nGoodbye. Thank you.\nYou're welcome. So I'm going to turn all this off and then we can just have a little closer look. Okay. That is so interesting. Mm-hmm.",
         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression. I try to stay happy, preferring that over being sad, and my kids really keep me going and sane, especially when they greet me from school. However, I definitely have my days, especially when I don't get enough sleep. When I'm not well-rested, I become irritated, tired, and lazy, feeling like I just want to lay down and get the rest I need. My job as a bus operator is very stressful, so getting good rest is crucial for me to handle it.\n\nLife as a single parent is hard and can be expensive, but I work to keep food in the house and support my kids the best way I can. I also experience a lot of frustration, particularly with my oldest daughter's situation. It's like talking to a wall sometimes, and it's frustrating that she's not hearing me, even though I'm trying to help her make changes to better her life. I've also had a lot of deaths around me, which is part of life experience.\n\nTo cope, I find peace in things like reading, taking long walks, hot baths, meditating, or just closing my eyes. I prioritize my rest because I know it helps me manage the stress of my job and daily life. I also believe in learning from mistakes and always trying to better myself, like going back to school now to advance my career.",

I meditate. And I sit down. I meditate. And I skateboard. Well, I can meditate on my board. Could you say a little more about that? I meditate. It helps me relax. Sometimes if I don't really feel like skating hard, I'll just go for a nice sunset skate and meditate, a nice two hour skate and just relax. That sounds like a great situation. How hard is that? It's not that hard. You just gotta get to the skate spots. I usually like skating. There's some good skate spots in LA, streets in LA. The beaches is always good. Nice. Just, it's really not that hard at all. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? The situation with my life right now, I can't find a fucking job. I just need a job.

At the end of the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? About three years ago. Four years ago. Couple years ago. What got you to seek help? My mood was just not right. I was always feeling down and depressed and lack of energy, always wanting to sleep. Lack of interest. Do you feel like therapy's useful? I've gone to therapy. It has been useful for me in the past. Is it useful for me now? I don't know, I don't have health insurance. I would love to talk to someone. I just feel like I don't have anyone. So I don't depend on anyone. Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Oh yeah, I've always felt depressed in my life. What were your symptoms? Lack of energy, wanting to sleep a lot, lack of interest. My appetite was uncontrollable, either lack of or I was just being gluttonous and eating the wrong things.

And, who would've known 20 years ago what advice I would've given myself because I tried to commit suicide instead of returning back to work. And so now it's just, it's been rough trying to pick up all the pieces and get my life back together. I don't know what advice I would give myself when I started with my corporate job 20 years ago. Okay, I didn't know I'd be here 20 years later. You know? Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy? A couple days ago this week, I've been trying to make ends meet. I've got a lot of things prouding. I've got a lot of things that are happening for me, but I need like two more weeks here in LA so I can connect the dots. But financially I don't have what it takes to stay here for two more weeks. So I was happy because I was getting callbacks. Things were starting to look up for me, but it's just time again isn't on my side. So my car is packed and I'm hitting the road and I'm taking off and I'm leaving LA. How would your best friend describe you? Loyal, emotional, strong, and a little bit of a Do you consider yourself an introvert? I have been lately. I was an extrovert for 20 years when I was a corporate manager. And now I am quite an introvert and I stay to myself. What made you decide to do that?

I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to send me an email. And your answers are really important. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, are you doing okay? Quite well. I feel good. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Here. Really? Mm-hmm. One of the few native-born Los Angelesians. What do you do now? I homeschool my 10-year-old son, and I'm a homemaker. I have five children and married 22 years. Wow. Mm-hmm. So that's a full-time job. Huh? Have you traveled a lot? Somewhat. We went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church. Yeah. So I would say yes. I've traveled a bit. I'd love to hear about one of your friends. Well, most recently, like two months ago, we went to Israel for a pilgrimage. We were gone about nine days, and it was fabulous. We spent the first five days in Korazim, which is near the Galilee, and in a place called... I mean, the name of the area is Korazim, but we stayed in a place called the Doma Scalileia, which is a house that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims. That's so good to hear. What do you enjoy about traveling? I enjoy... Really, the most important thing I enjoy is meeting the people and, of course, seeing the history, especially Israel. I mean, it's totally ancient, but most I enjoy is the people, I think, to get a better understanding of how different cultures live. Okay. You can do this all by yourself? No, not at all. Why? Just don't. All my life, I've always been open and willing to socialize, and I remember my younger brother always joking, saying that I would talk to anybody, and I will. I'll talk to just about anybody, just because I enjoy learning about other people. That's good. What do you do to relax? By the end of the day, after I've cooked dinner, and we've had dinner together as a family, there's a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while, and then watch TV, have a cocktail with my husband, and just relax. That's what we do. Because we have a lot going on, we don't stay up too late, and I like to watch crime dramas. Nice. What does it mean to be really mad? Really mad? Probably not a lot. I get frustrated with, for example, my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever, so that gets me angry. In terms of really getting heatedly angry, other than little things that my children do, especially my oldest child who's 21, he can be confrontational. Other than that, nothing really gets me really angry. I haven't felt that. What's the best thing about being human? Contributing to society, helping to raise responsible people, I guess. Of course, the love and the affection and the fun and the excitement that goes with it, and all the stages that go. Right now, I'm in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers. I have one 11-year-old, and the rest are all teenagers and adults. It's really fun because we're able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that's going on in the world, and have challenging discussions and that sort of thing. It's a different level than when you're taking care of babies and changing diapers and that kind of stuff. What's the hardest thing about being human? The hardest thing is that it's 24-7. You're never not a parent, and so you have to accept that. I remember with my first child thinking, when I brought him home from the hospital, this is it. There's no going back. I guess you could if you did something horrible, but in normal circumstances you can't change that. It's a permanent thing. In some ways it takes away your freedom, but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom. I'm sorry? I didn't get what you said. Some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life, most importantly my church and my faith, but also my husband. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very, very kind. He's very logical thinking and very grounded. If I get emotional or I get upset about something, we balance each other out. Likewise, if he gets upset about something, I'm able to balance him out. That's been a great gift in my life. How do you do it completely? I don't think I'd be categorized as somebody with a temper. Occasionally I get angry, but rarely do I have outbursts. I'm more likely to say what I feel, not let it build up. My husband and I don't rarely fight, have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that. It almost never happens. Like I said, I'm more of a type of person that communicates on the spot. If I'm thinking something, I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up. That's good. When was the last time you argued with your husband? Usually I'm arguing with my older son because he thinks he knows everything. He's 21 years old, so he has the know-it-all mentality. I'm just telling him that he doesn't know it all. As life goes on, he'll learn more. He's very confident and very self-assured. He thinks that everything he does is correct. He still has a lot of learning to do. It sounds really hard. It can be. What do you think is a good kid? I think that many of them are spoiled and live in an environment of instant gratification, which I think is going to be detrimental to the future of this country. Given that, with all the technology we have, there's really not any way to go back. I have hope that they will... I think this country was built on hard work and ethics. Hopefully, the next generation and the generations after that can maintain that standard of living. I don't know if it's possible. How would your best friend describe you? As loving, nurturing, funny. We laugh a lot. Caring, honest. Things that... I mean, my best friend... Well, actually, my best friend is... It's two people, it's two sisters that I grew up with. We, for some years, took care of their mother who has Alzheimer's before my parents got sick. I have a very close relationship with them, still do. I'm considered the fourth sister. I would say that those are my best friends. We love each other very much. It's a good relationship. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long have you been diagnosed with depression? Minorally, depression. It was more anxiety. Probably... It's probably been five or six years. I've had it off and on all my life, but it was never diagnosed originally. As a teenager, I think is when I first started with the anxiety. Other than that, I... Depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control. But now it's under control. I have a great... Are you triggered by something? No, I think it was what they call free-floating anxiety. I think it's a kind of organic reason for it. In other words, there was a chemical imbalance in my brain. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling pretty good, actually. The holidays were great. We had a good family gatherings. A little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out. My dad is really sick. We've offered to move in with them. They have a big home, but we would have to do a lot of... Some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around. We're in the throes of that. That's a big change, but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get... They're in their 80s. As they get closer to death, I want to have my family there with them. I understand. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not easy. Usually, all my life I think I've always... I mean, I've always had... At least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, basically. Other than that, I mean, no. Now I sleep well. Other than that, I sleep well. But sometimes if I wake up really early in the morning, then I can't go back to sleep. I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep. It depends on what my schedule is and if the kids have to be at school early. There's a lot of factors. That sucks. Yeah, sometimes it does. What are you making your sleep from? Probably basically the same. I think I might complain a bit like, oh, I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever, you know. But I think overall I'm probably the same. My kids know. I'll tell my kids, oh, I'm really tired. And they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful. And maybe my other daughter will try to cook dinner or something like that. So, you know, they may pitch in a little bit more. I can understand she's using it to be there. Not really. Not, not, no. Not really. Not anything significant. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Actually, yes, I do. I do feel like therapy is useful. Tell me more about that. Well, we had a situation with my daughter. She also suffers from anxiety. And we have had her in therapy for some time. And we just recently are, we're about to finish a group with her. It was a six month group for DBT, it's called. And it's like a, it's the first time, it's the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers. And it's been really good. It's been very helpful. It's just all about how to live in the moment and how to, you know, actual physical and mental strategies to keep your, keep you from your mind from going crazy, you know, worrying about things or, you know, in this case, some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever. So that's the focus of the therapy. And it's been really good. My husband and I both have been going with our daughter. And it's been really, really informational and really helpful, I think. That's so good to hear. What got you to see the company? Oh, my daughter was, she was in a bad way. She was, you know, suffering a lot. And we knew it and we acted on it. That's all. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? Like really joyful and happy, I would say probably. I mean, probably it would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the, in Cana. So, you know, where the wedding of Cana took place. That was really moving and beautiful. And it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day. We flew to Israel. So it was right at the same time. It was beautiful. Very meaningful. And other than that, I would say, you know, like other joyful occasions have been, you know, like Christmas and, you know, family gatherings and, you know, my dad's birthday. He turned 83 on Christmas Eve, you know, that kind of thing. So. What are some things that you do? That's an interesting question. I would say once I get like things done that I need to do, like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or errands to run once I get them done, I feel like a sense of accomplishment. You know, much like I mean, I worked for many years as an administrative manager at UCLA. And, you know, once you get a project done or you get your whatever month end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that you have to make deadlines. There's that feeling of like, yeah, I got it done, you know. So I think that would be, you know, for me, the most most recent way of feeling good and feeling, you know, like feeling accomplished. What's your dream job? Dream job? I think I've already lived it. I'm also a birth doula. And yeah, and so I've attended a lot of births and now I really only do it for family and friends. And it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth, the bringing of new life into this world. So I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and I didn't know it. I trained much after, you know, I did my managerial stuff and was it is and was awesome. So I don't work at a hospital anymore. Actually, the hospital that I worked at is now closed. But like I said, I do for family and friends. What made you decide to do it? I attended a friend of mine's birth by accident. She she happened to have the same OB as I did with all my children. And I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor. We were close friends and, you know, her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there. She wanted me to stay. She didn't want me to leave. I hadn't planned on it. So that was the first birth that I attended outside of, you know, my self-giving birth, which is a whole different experience. So after that, I was really interested in possibly studying nurse midwifery. But then I discovered this thing called being a doula, which is really gives you even a lot more hands on one on one contact with the patient, which is what I like. So I trained to do that at a hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago because my son is 15 and he was a year old. No, 16 years ago. So, yeah, and I've been. Well, it can be challenging in terms of hours. It depends on how long the woman's in labor. But and, you know, also like for me, I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be their doula that I cannot guarantee 100 percent. I'm not doing it for business. And that way and because of that, I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available, somebody else could fill in for me. So but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me, I've been able to be there for some reason. So the the the only one that I missed was one a friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby. I was with her for her first, but her labor went so fast she didn't even call me. It was in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of labor. She would even if she had called me, I would have been there in time. So went really fast. But other than that, you know, yeah, I've been been able to attend all the births of people that have asked me to do. In all of life or in your job? Probably my my own birth. I mean, my the birth of my own children. Like there's an extreme sense of joy, excitement, relief, because of course you're out of the pain. And then like it's just it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's it's like something you can't explain. It's it's just it's awesome after you give birth. So and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I had my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both both experiences. I was my third child that had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic. But other than that, we laugh about it now. But when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she she was not there when the doctor I mean, it was my my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And my husband was there, but she was not. No, it was a doctor. And she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that. And my daughter was born in the bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor. But I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago, 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more not as relaxed, not as like I feel now at my age that I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry about I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what you know, you know, like my I notice my daughters. Oh, Mom, you can't wear that because people are going to say this. I say, I don't care. You know, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that, oh, Mom, you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever. So that would probably be it. The wisdom that you you achieve with age that you see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. Most proud of. Probably my family, my husband and my my children. I mean, the fact that we've stayed married, that we've were an intact family, that my kids see every day how their friends suffer, who who come from divorced families or single parents. And they they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. Probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years, I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people I know from church. And it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. OK. OK. Goodbye. Hello, Squick.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nThere you are. Don't I look gorgeous? Let me straighten up a little bit here. Okay, so I'm just going to do something that syncs our equipment.

And then like it's just a matter of, you know, going forward from there. But it's like something you can't explain. It's just awesome after you give birth. So and I've experienced both ways. I've done both natural and I had my last child was by a C-section. So I've had both experiences. I was my third child that had kind of a crazy nurse. She was a little psychotic. But other than that, we laugh about it now. But when I was in labor, it wasn't funny. And she was not there when the doctor I mean, it was my third child was born very quickly after he broke the water. And my husband was there, but she was not. No, it was a doctor. And she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that. And my daughter was born in the bed. So for me, it was great because I didn't have to go through any other labor. But I'm sure they weren't happy. They have to fill out a lot of paperwork after that. So now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago, I was probably more not as relaxed, not as like I feel now at my age that I don't have the same concerns that I did then. I don't worry at all about what people think about me. I don't worry at all about what you know, like my I notice my daughters. Oh, Mom, you can't wear that because people are going to say this. I say, I don't care. You know, but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that, oh, Mom, you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever. So that would probably be it. The wisdom that you achieve with age that you see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things. Most proud of. Probably my family, my husband and my children. I mean, the fact that we've stayed married, that we've were an intact family, that my kids see every day how their friends suffer, who come from divorced families or single parents. And they actually express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still, you know, we are still a family. So I would say that's probably it. Probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgmental. Through the years, I've had a lot of experience with people with problems, a lot of friends with problems, people I know from church. And it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses, everybody has problems, and I don't think I'm better than someone else. If you think you're better than someone else, then that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough. OK. OK. Goodbye. Hello, Squick.",
         "I've been diagnosed with depression, though it's been more minor depression and predominantly anxiety. I've had it off and on all my life, starting with anxiety as a teenager, but it was only formally diagnosed about five or six years ago. My anxiety is what they call free-floating, likely due to a chemical imbalance, not specific triggers.\n\nCurrently, my anxiety and depression are under control, and I've been feeling pretty good lately, especially after the holidays. However, sleep has always been a challenge for me; I often wake up in the middle of the night. If I wake up too early, I sometimes can't go back to sleep and might get up to do computer work before trying to sleep again. When I'm feeling tired or my body hurts, my kids notice and sometimes pitch in to help, like my older daughter being helpful or my other daughter trying to cook dinner.\n\nMy husband is a great support; we balance each other out if one of us gets emotional or upset. I also believe therapy is useful. We've been attending group therapy for DBT with our daughter, who also suffers from anxiety, and it's been very helpful for learning strategies to manage our minds and worries.",

Yes, I do. Well, I'm a football recruiter, so I travel all around the world to sign different football players for our sports management company. Just the independence about it being alone, being able to be free and not tied down to one thing, you know, it's great. I remember traveling to. And take them to clubs and this and that. We're not that type of organization. Yeah. This honesty. I don't like when people are dishonest. That really, really, really bothers me and not true, not honest, not real. That that upsets me a lot. I tend to just try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind. I usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head. I'm okay with it at times, but I can definitely be better. Oh, I argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school and she she wants to raise her one way. And I think I want to raise her a kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations. So I think different discipline is a big key in a kid's life and she she she was raised a little differently. I don't know, just angry, upset, you know, when you're in an argument, that's what you feel. So you do and say things that that that bother you and you just you go on with it. Yeah, a little bit. I don't know. I just just the way I feel. I don't know. I can't really say just the way I feel. A little, a little. I don't know, just realness. Honesty, truth, just being straight out front. I'm pretty close. I'm pretty close with my family. Oh, oh, another subject just they're raised different. I think society is going to become even wilder the way the kids are raised and no discipline and the things they're doing, everything we we they live in, everything inflated so much to where it's getting to a point where it's getting out of hand. I think kids these days to a certain extent are much wilder than I was and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and you know, just education wise. I think it's just tough times for kids and the way they act. It's it's ridiculous to me. I definitely like to watch sports. I like to gamble. I like to travel. I like to skate. I like kind of like a guy that likes to see different sites and go different places like that. I'm a big movie person so I like going to theater stuff like that. I'm actually living it.

I just my goal is to get a little higher in a ladder and in all my own sports management company, but I'm doing pretty well for myself so I'm happy. Yeah. No. No. No. Um, it's okay. It's pretty easy. Irritated. Tired. I don't know. It's been a while. It's been a while. A couple weeks ago. What did you say? No, not really. I think he would describe me as a stand up guy. I try to be a good loyal friend and an adult. I think he would describe me like that. School. Once school grew up together. I've been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life. Yeah. We're very close. My friends and I are very close. We pretty much do a lot together still at this age. I'm honest. I'm loyal. Very loyal. I'm an art worker. I think I am to a certain extent I'm just not the average guy. I'm pretty much I'm a different breed. I just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy.

I actually let a lady of my life go years ago that I felt was my soul mate. We had a big argument. One thing led to another. We decided to take a break. I started dating somebody else and I told her I'm going to go my way and she went her way. I think that was a bad decision. Very bad decision. Yeah, totally. I think I could have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of being so upset and moving forward. I'm just upset. I tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded. I need to think a little more when I'm upset. I don't know. Just experience the time. Make enough for your mistakes and being better about these decisions after you made the mistakes. Think a little harder about situations and things and the decisions that you make. Think a lot longer and harder before you make them and I think the outcome will be a little different today. My grandmother, she's always been a positive influence. She's a great black woman with old school ways of living. I think I've added that to my life. She's a great woman. She's a great woman. I was a pretty good player. I was a pretty good athlete growing up. I was one of the top. I had started a future in athletics and that's what I wanted to do so I accomplished my growth. At the time it was a great thing and still is a great thing. It's a great accomplishment in my life. Accomplishments. Being able to, if I have a goal or something I'm supposed to do that week or that day and I accomplish it always puts me in a good mood. Or getting my job done the way I'm supposed to do it in a timely fashion always puts me in a good mood. Being a positive role model right now for younger kids that's in our sports academy program. I think as I got older the thought process and the way I look at life has totally changed. I think a lot of kids can look up to me that I deal with now and say that's somebody that is a positive influence in my life.

Let's see if I can start you up. Oh, actually, before that, one thing I almost forgot, I have to do something that syncs our equipment. There we go. All right. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just creative to talk to you about the world and state and the spirit environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And if things feel free to tell me everything, the answers are within comprehension. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm all right. That's good. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Oh, really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? The lights, the big city. It's always something going on. What are some things you don't really like about LA? The traffic and that's it. Okay. What's your study at school? Business administration and business management. Are you still doing that? Not that. I'm doing networking at the moment. What's your dream job? Hmm. To open up a big clothing line and just supply the whole world with clothing. That sounds interesting. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Definitely. Why? Because I'm all about myself. It's all about me. Do you feel that way often? Not often, but more times than not, yeah. What are some things that you do really like? Being lied to and I guess when people think you're dumber than what you are. I understand. What do you do when you're in life? I try to get away from everything. Go into my own space. How are you at controlling your temper? Very well. I'm great at controlling my temper. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? Probably two days ago. It was probably just over some sports. It wasn't a real argument. Okay. Do you travel a lot? Not a lot, but I travel enough. What do you enjoy about traveling? Just being able to get a change of pace. See somebody new, see new faces, new environment. I'd love to hear about your trips. Let me see. The last trip I had was Vegas. You know how Vegas goes. It was pretty fun. There was a lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on. Nice. What would you say of somebody that's following you? Pretty open-minded. I'm kind to pretty much everybody. I'm a pretty even-killed guy. How do you like your living situation? It's alright. It could be better. Do you have roommates? No. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No, ma'am. Have you ever been diagnosed with stethoscopy? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Lately it's been pretty tough. I guess because I haven't stand up so late. That's my fault. Why? I don't know. I guess I'm a night owl all of a sudden. I'm turning into an owl. Okay. What are you like when you're not sleeping well? Sluggish and tired all day if I don't sleep well. All day I'm just laying around. Have you ever stayed in a hotel room? No. Not too much. Okay. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Stay focused and listen to the adults. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. I'm not a good sleeper. Listen to the adults. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Tell me more about that. I mean, self-exponential. I think I just listened to parents or other adults that tried to stare you in the right way. You know, you're being a stubborn kid at those ages. So it's like, what are you talking about? It's my life. I can do what I want. I don't have to listen to you. But now I'm a good sleeper. I can still listen to you. But now I see that what they were telling me was correct. Yeah. How are your best friends describing you? Um, hilarious. Okay. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. You're someone that's been a positive influence in your life. Both my parents, mother and father. That's great. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Recently, what did I do? New Year's Eve party. I had the time of my life. It was so fun. I'd love to hear all about it. This New Year's Eve, I went to a party at a friend's house in Balling Hills area. He had it at a pretty nice house. It's a three story house. And it was like 350 people in there. It was pretty fun. But it was also not that fun because it was so many people and you couldn't really move. So that was the only downfall. I brought my New Year in great with tons of friends. That's how it's supposed to be done. Awesome. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, I'm generally in a good mood every day. I mean, waking up puts me in a good mood. I guess you could say that. I don't know. I don't know. A good meal. That's so good to hear. What's one of your most memorable experiences? One of my most memorable experiences were probably when I was younger. I was in a Boy Scouts and we used to go camping all the time. And then one year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite, one of those places. And we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge. And of course being from the city I'm like mountain biking. I can ride a mountain bike. But once we got into the real mountains and got on real mountain bikes, I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers. It was pretty, it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour in dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense. I'll never forget that. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a tough one to answer. What am I most proud of? I don't know honestly. Bye. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one. That's a good one.",

Well, I think this school shooting thing and the NRA seeming to not want to budge on this gun control issue thing. That's it. I try to remove myself from that situation that's annoying me. I've been better over the years. Most of the time I just try to, you know, walk away or, you know, control my emotions in terms of, you know, just walking away. Just watch TV now. I would say my children being born. Well, I have four children. Each birth was special. And, you know, it was a unique experience each time. It's a lot easier now because they're all adults. But, you know, it was challenging. I would say senior children grow up to be successful and exceeding your expectations. You worry all the time. You worry for them. You know, now I'm not around them as much and I certainly worry about them. Then I saw my children. About a week ago. I'm usually pretty happy when I see them. You know, I'm interested. My girlfriend and insignificant. No. Around LA maybe, but that's about it. Excuse me. Why don't I travel? I don't have the funds to do that anymore. Or the health. No. Yes. Let's see about a year. Recognizing that there were some things in me that were wrong. I knew that there was something wrong if I wasn't myself. Well, you know, I was always tired and not excited about things anymore. Kind of lethargic, you know, laying around and just not feeling myself. About the same. Yes, I do. Once a month. Yeah, I do. I do. Well, it's, you know, it's, you know, I see a psychologist and we talk about things. I don't really want to elaborate in detail, but you know, it's, I seem to think that it's helpful. Well, I think. That's a hard question. Let's move on, please. I think it's a little bit irritable. Cranky. Yeah, it is. That's a good question. It's been a while. I'd say. Year and a half, maybe. I've lost a lot of stuff going on in my life. You know, I just lost my parent, my dad, my last parent. Just a lot of stuff going on. I'll leave it at that. Well, I still like sports, you know. I like to play soccer or something. It usually puts me in a good mood, particularly if my team wins. You know, I like USC. I have a nephew that's a freshman football player at USC. And I've been a children's football fan for 40 years. You know, I think I listen well and, you know, I'm pretty much honest and straightforward. That's a good question. I don't know. You'd have to ask her. Definitely my mother. But she's deceased now. She's been deceased 10 years, but she was definitely positive influence my entire life. No, I have many regrets. Too many to name and number. But, you know, it's, you know, you have the benefit of hindsight. Yeah, I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of regrets. I have a lot of kids. I'm very proud of them. It's been a pleasure. Okay. It went on a lot easier.",

         "I haven't been feeling like myself for about a year now. I'm always tired, lethargic, and just not excited about things anymore, often just laying around. I've also noticed I've become a bit irritable and cranky, which has been going on for about a year and a half. This started around the time I lost my last parent, my dad, and there's just been a lot of stuff going on in my life. I'm currently unemployed, and my health and funds limit my ability to travel. To cope, I try to remove myself from annoying situations, or just walk away and control my emotions. I also just watch TV now. I do see a psychologist once a month, which I find helpful. Despite everything, I still enjoy sports, like playing soccer or watching USC football, especially when my team wins, as that usually puts me in a good mood. I worry a lot about my four adult children, even though they're successful. I also carry many regrets from my past.",

When she's done, she'll let you know. I'm going to put the doorbell right next to you. So when she's done, just let me know. Hi, I'm Ellie. I'm a student at the University of New York. I'm not a very good student, but I'm very learning about people. I'm a graduate of the University of New York. I like to do research and research. I'm a student here at the University of New York. I like to do research and research. Are you a student here at the University of New York? Yes. So, are you Indian? Okay. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from India. Why do you miss the land? Why do I miss the land? Why do I miss LA? When did you start? Oh, about 20 years ago. How often do you go back to LA? Once every 3-4 years. How did you get used to it? I mean, the first 6 months it was a little difficult. But then I got used to it and I feel very comfortable now. That's good. Are you comfortable? Yes. What do you enjoy about traveling? The food. Actually, I enjoy flying, then meeting different people, different scenes. Then I try to achieve my goals. I'm sorry? How did you get involved in the business? I used to run a business. I used to travel to meet people, to get orders. Traveling involved going to Northeast, Ohio and Pennsylvania, places like that. Meet top people to get orders for my business. I enjoyed listening to their problems. I used to take them out for dinner. I genuinely enjoyed talking to them. Many of them were open enough to tell me about their problems. But my main goal, main objective was to get the orders for the business. Nice. What do you do for a living? I cook, watch movies, meet friends, throw a party. What do you do now? I'm talking to you. What did you study before? I'm an engineer. I did mechanical engineering. I'm also an MBA. Are you still working on it? Actually, I branched off to finance. I trade stocks now. How did you get involved in the business? A friend of mine was making a lot of money in stocks. First, I used to interact with him. I realized he was making a lot of money. Then I did a formal course in it. I attended a lot of seminars. Lost a lot of money before I started making money. What do you do for a living? I watch movies, visit people, play basketball, do shopping, cook. How are you doing? I'm very good at controlling my temper. When was the last time you argued with your brother? The last time I argued was with my brother. It was about my dad. He's getting old. He lives in India. I was planning on bringing him here. My brother said it's going to be very expensive with respect to health bills. I was arguing with him that we should all pull in the money and get them here. They are quite old. I have a mom too. They are both old. How close are you with your family? I'm very close to my parents. Not so close with my brother and their family. Why? I tend to be judgmental. I think sometimes that my niece and nephew should have been brought up in a different way. My brother doesn't seem to think along the same lines. We have disagreements and that's the reason. Do you think it's going to happen? It is. Do you believe in their race? No, not at this time. What do you think is going to happen? What do I think of what? What do you think is going to happen? Can you repeat that one more time? What do you think is going to happen? I still couldn't follow you. What's the matter with you? Have you ever served in the army? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. How long ago were you diagnosed? About one to two years ago. What made you decide to go into the army? I was feeling down and I was not interested in things that I was normally interested in. I was sort of withdrawn and I was not able to focus on my things. I went to see a doctor and I ended up doing that. Did you ever have trouble sleeping? No. What made you decide to go into the army? I lost appetite. I was not sleeping well. I had difficulty concentrating and focusing. I was not getting my assignments done on time. These were some of the problems. How have you been doing lately? I've been feeling good. You've been doing yoga? No, I don't. Why didn't you stop doing yoga? I started doing yoga and I've been doing that for about a year. And meditation. That's helped a lot. Awesome. What made you decide to do it? It's just that when I was diagnosed with depression, I thought I shouldn't be taking any medication for it. I was looking at other ways to get over the problem. Then I realized some of my friends were doing meditation and I got influenced by them. How easy is it to get rid of depression? It's a little difficult. But I've been able to sleep within half an hour. There are days when it takes almost one or two hours to go to sleep. Are you better by sleeping? Are they what? Can you repeat that? Are you better by sleeping? No. What are you working on these days? When did you last do yoga? Okay. What are you most proud of? What am I proud of? I was among the top 2% in my MBA class. When I used to run my business, I designed a product that was working really well. I was happy that I was able to design something that was so useful for my business. How are your best friends? I'm thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly, very easy to get along with, very focused, very intelligent, and a good cook. Who's your best friend? Albert Einstein. Can you tell me about that? Some of his theories involve a lot of deep thinking. The first few times I read about him, about his theories, I had difficulty in really understanding that. When there are things that I really try to understand and I'm not able to, they're all the type of people I admire. What advice would you give yourself? I would say to be open to other people. What is the thing you like about yoga? It's diverse and I like the entertainment industry. I like the fact that there are more women than men here. There are certain areas where only Spanish is spoken. I would like for all people who come to America to be able to understand English and be able to speak in English so that everybody can participate. What is the thing you like about doing yoga? In LA? What is the thing you like about doing yoga? Some of the things the political leaders do really make me mad. Sometimes I think they're wasting their time, our time, and other countries are advancing. These guys don't get things done and I feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry. What advice would you give to people? The first four years of the Obama administration I think it was wasted because if Congress had acted together and got things done, then maybe we could have made it much more difficult for China to catch up with us. The fact that China is able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still argue and find faults with each other and not get things done. They don't seem to realize that the clock keeps ticking. They have to get things done. What's one thing that makes you feel bad? One thing that comes to my mind is that I made a lot of money once in Los Angeles. I remember that it happened during Christmas some 10 years ago and that made me very happy. What is something that makes you feel bad? Good music, good food, a party with friends that I like, and I also like cooking and I enjoy cooking with groups. Those are things that really put me in a good mood. What advice would you give to people? I hope you enjoyed this video and I hope it was worth your time. Thank you so much. You've been nice. Bye. Thank you.",

         " Okay, looks good. Do something for our purposes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Good. Chicago. It's cold in Chicago. Oh, I think in 90. 1989, actually. Oh, very simple. Very easy. Weather, of course. I'm so easily located to San Diego, Palm Springs, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and things I like to do. Smog, of course, is bad. Crime and retirement should be. And financial and economic problems here. Every year. Thanksgiving. Very, very much so. We're a very big family. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Very much in fact. I love flying on airplanes. I love visiting new places. I even like visiting different airports. Everyone's different. Oh, let's see. I started off in high school. I was in the pre-med. I ended up in physics. Yes, I teach physics. And math. My dad was a truant officer. And I've enjoyed it. It keeps you young. My dream job would be to be a judge. Yes, in the youth court. I'm not going to be able to do that. No. Not at all. I enjoy people. Being around people. I'm very talkative at times. I like to do a lot of things. I'm very social when I do them. Believe it or not, I play bridge. I play chess. And I watch a good old, old movie. Ooh. Bad drivers. Bad laws. Politics often. What do you do when you're annoyed? I really don't get annoyed that much. I just let it go. It's not worth the pain and problems it could cause. If I can't straighten out a problem, let it go. Go somewhere else. Always my bridge partner. But that's different. As far as anything else, I don't really argue with people. I don't like confrontation. My parents, of course. I had great parents. Can you tell me about that? My parents were at Tuskegee, which is a black college. They always want me to go to a black college, but of course I didn't want to do that. They're a very positive role model for me. I don't drink. I don't curse. I don't look down on people who do, but I don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things. I love to drive. I love to travel. My dad used to always take us someplace every weekend he was off. We'd go somewhere. We were in Chicago, Indiana, Michigan. Someplace in the area. We'd go to Michigan and pick fruit. We'd go to puppy farms in Indiana, that kind of thing. I had an uncle who lived in Wisconsin who was a dairy farmer. My dad used to love to drive, and I love to drive also. That's a hard one. I've had a lot of great experiences. I think the best one was we went, for my anniversary we went to Europe. We went to Paris. We rode the Orient Express. We didn't go all the way to Istanbul. We went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris. That was probably the best experience I've ever had in my life. I've never really cared for Europe because there's so much here in the United States to do and so much in America. I've been to Alaska and Hawaii, but we said we'd do something different. We'd always want to go on the Orient Express. We did that. Expensive, but a phenomenal trip. You've got to do it once. It's a once trip. Not once in a lifetime, just once. Not traveling more sooner. There are a lot of things we should have probably done we didn't do. We always went to Chicago on Thanksgiving, but I think we should have gone more than just on Thanksgiving. My parents come here around Christmas time, but I think we should have done a lot more when it comes to that. Yes, that's why it's a regret because it could have been avoided. We could have done a lot more things we could have done and we would have spent our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us. I think that people... Oh yes, very definitely. That's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago. I would have said don't take things too seriously, but don't be too relaxed over them either. Sometimes you can take things for granted. Never take anything for granted. Nothing's promised. Oh, heaven forbid. No, I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Very, very easy. I really have no problem with that. Once in a while. If I'm anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due, then I get kind of anxious a little bit. I don't like to be late. I don't like to make mistakes. Therefore, I do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that everything is right. What are you like when you're just being blown? Tired. I don't get irritable or anything. I'm just nostalgic maybe. I'm just a little bit. How have you been feeling lately? Very good. I was up late last night, so I'm kind of tired now. I usually have no problem sleeping. I get a good night's sleep. I just came back off a Christmas break. I should be very relaxed now. What are you most proud of in your life? I have great kids. I have a son at USC. I have a son at UCLA. My daughter just got married. I'm really proud of my kids. They're going to have a good life. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I enjoyed it. I still enjoy it. Being a parent is forever. What's the best thing about being a parent? Taking care of someone else and getting them started off to have a good life. I think that that's rewarding. Making sure everything is covered. That needs to be covered with your kids. Whether it's their eating, their sleeping, their clothes, their dress, make sure they're content. Make sure they have no problems at school or at home. Physically, mentally, spiritually, everything. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend would say she has not changed since high school. Level-headed, but a great sense of humor. Relaxed. I don't take things too seriously. When was the last time you felt really happy? I love the holidays. I love Christmas. I love everything about it. I love preparing the house for it. I love baking and cooking. Especially baking. I love experimenting with new recipes. The last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here, I felt fantastic. Everything is quiet. I'm not at work. I'm not stressed out in any way at all. I have no projects to do. I have to think about it anyway. Christmas time. Holiday time. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I really enjoyed it recently. Well, Christmas of course. We went to Las Vegas on the 27th of December. That was fantastic. We only stayed for two days. We had a really good time. We saw a great show. We had some great food. We drove there. We don't usually drive. I don't like to drive a lot, but we drove there and just took our time. That sounds like a great situation. It was good. It was nice. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Goodbye. Thanks for listening. How's that one? Okay. I have to ring the bell. My mind is wandering. Here we go. Hi there. Okay. Actually, before I do that, let me see if I can get the mic on. Okay.",
         "Okay, looks good. Do something for our purposes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Good. Chicago. It's cold in Chicago. Oh, I think in 90. 1989, actually. Oh, very simple. Very easy. Weather, of course. I'm so easily located to San Diego, Palm Springs, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and things I like to do. Smog, of course, is bad. Crime and retirement should be. And financial and economic problems here. Every year. Thanksgiving. Very, very much so. We're a very big family. Yes, I do. Very much in fact. I love flying on airplanes. I love visiting new places. I even like visiting different airports. Everyone's different. Oh, let's see. I started off in high school. I was in the pre-med. I ended up in physics. Yes, I teach physics. And math. My dad was a truant officer. And I've enjoyed it. It keeps you young. My dream job would be to be a judge. Yes, in the youth court. I'm not going to be able to do that. No. Not at all. I enjoy people. Being around people. I'm very talkative at times. I like to do a lot of things. I'm very social when I do them. Believe it or not, I play bridge. I play chess. And I watch a good old movie. Ooh. Bad drivers. Bad laws. Politics often. What do you do when you're annoyed? I really don't get annoyed that much. I just let it go. It's not worth the pain and problems it could cause. If I can't straighten out a problem, let it go. Go somewhere else. Always my bridge partner. But that's different. As far as anything else, I don't really argue with people. I don't like confrontation. My parents, of course. I had great parents. Can you tell me about that? My parents were at Tuskegee, which is a black college. They always want me to go to a black college, but of course I didn't want to do that. They're a very positive role model for me. I don't drink. I don't curse. I don't look down on people who do, but I don't have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things. I love to drive. I love to travel. My dad used to always take us someplace every weekend he was off. We'd go somewhere. We were in Chicago, Indiana, Michigan. Someplace in the area. We'd go to Michigan and pick fruit. We'd go to puppy farms in Indiana, that kind of thing. I had an uncle who lived in Wisconsin who was a dairy farmer. My dad used to love to drive, and I love to drive also. That's a hard one. I've had a lot of great experiences. I think the best one was we went, for my anniversary we went to Europe. We went to Paris. We rode the Orient Express. We didn't go all the way to Istanbul. We went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris. That was probably the best experience I've ever had in my life. I've never really cared for Europe because there's so much here in the United States to do and so much in America. I've been to Alaska and Hawaii, but we said we'd do something different. We'd always want to go on the Orient Express. We did that. Expensive, but a phenomenal trip. You've got to do it once. It's a once trip. Not once in a lifetime, just once. Not traveling more sooner. There are a lot of things we should have probably done we didn't do. We always went to Chicago on Thanksgiving, but I think we should have gone more than just on Thanksgiving. My parents come here around Christmas time, but I think we should have done a lot more when it comes to that. Yes, that's why it's a regret because it could have been avoided. We could have done a lot more things we could have done and we would have spent our time working and more concerned about getting ahead than actually family and what's closest to us. I think that people... Oh yes, very definitely. That's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago. I would have said don't take things too seriously, but don't be too relaxed over them either. Sometimes you can take things for granted. Never take anything for granted. Nothing's promised. Oh, heaven forbid. No, I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Very easy. I really have no problem with that. Once in a while. If I'm anxious about something or have things coming up due or projects due, then I get kind of anxious a little bit. I don't like to be late. I don't like to make mistakes. Therefore, I do have some anxiety issues which will cause me to stay up all night to get things done just to make sure that everything is right. What are you like when you're just being blown? Tired. I don't get irritable or anything. I'm just nostalgic maybe. I'm just a little bit. How have you been feeling lately? Very good. I was up late last night, so I'm kind of tired now. I usually have no problem sleeping. I get a good night's sleep. I just came back off a Christmas break. I should be very relaxed now. What are you most proud of in your life? I have great kids. I have a son at USC. I have a son at UCLA. My daughter just got married. I'm really proud of my kids. They're going to have a good life. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I enjoyed it. I still enjoy it. Being a parent is forever. What's the best thing about being a parent? Taking care of someone else and getting them started off to have a good life. I think that that's rewarding. Making sure everything is covered. That needs to be covered with your kids. Whether it's their eating, their sleeping, their clothes, their dress, make sure they're content. Make sure they have no problems at school or at home. Physically, mentally, spiritually, everything. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend would say she has not changed since high school. Level-headed, but a great sense of humor. Relaxed. I don't take things too seriously. When was the last time you felt really happy? I love the holidays. I love Christmas. I love everything about it. I love preparing the house for it. I love baking and cooking. Especially baking. I love experimenting with new recipes. The last couple of weeks because the holiday season was just here, I felt fantastic. Everything is quiet. I'm not at work. I'm not stressed out in any way at all. I have no projects to do. I have to think about it anyway. Christmas time. Holiday time. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I really enjoyed it recently. Well, Christmas of course. We went to Las Vegas on the 27th of December. That was fantastic. We only stayed for two days. We had a really good time. We saw a great show. We had some great food. We drove there.

Okay. Actually, before I do that, let me see if I can get the mic on. Okay.",
         "I generally feel very good and relaxed, especially after a break. I love the holidays, particularly Christmas, and during that time, I feel fantastic because everything is quiet, and I'm not stressed with work or projects. I don't tend to get annoyed easily; I prefer to just let things go, as I don't believe it's worth the pain or problems. I also avoid confrontation and arguments. When I'm just tired, I'm simply nostalgic, not irritable.\n\nI usually have no problem getting a good night's sleep. However, if I'm anxious about upcoming deadlines or projects, or worried about being late or making mistakes, that anxiety can keep me up all night to ensure everything is done perfectly. I enjoy being around people; I'm very social and talkative, and I like to do a lot of things like playing bridge and chess, or watching old movies. I'm very proud of my children and find being a parent rewarding, focusing on ensuring they are well taken care of physically, mentally, and spiritually.\n\nI've never been diagnosed with depression or PTSD. My main challenge is this anxiety related to performance and perfectionism, which occasionally affects my sleep. My coping strategies involve letting go of problems I can't fix, avoiding confrontation, and engaging in social activities and hobbies. My parents were great, positive role models, and I have a very big family. My anxiety is primarily triggered by work deadlines and my desire for perfection.",

Who's someone that's been a positive employee? My family. I'd love to hear all about it. My mother. She's a very good-hearted person. Gives me good advice. That's good. What are some things you like to do for fun? Oh, pretty close. Yeah. Family comes first. Family's number one. Yeah. What are some things you like to do for fun? Go to the gym. You know, exercise. Go to the beach. Party every once in a while. Watch basketball, football. Okay. Take trips. Go to Vegas. What's the last time you had that? Which one? Went to the gym last night.

You know, head up the city. What do you do to relax? I don't go to the beach. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, that's been a problem over the years. What's the only thing you worry about? I don't know. I just have a little anger, I guess. Anger management problem. When was the last time you had a problem with someone? Probably only yesterday. I forget what it was about. What do you do when you're in life? I go to the gym. What are some things that will be really annoying? People. Tell me more about that. I don't know, just people. Just the way they are, I guess. They get on my nerves sometimes. Okay. What's your dream job? Dream job? Well, I was working at LAX. I built this city right here, Plan Vista, where we're at. I pretty much built all of it that's been built so far, the past 10 years. Then I always wanted to work at the airport, LAX. I finally accomplished that goal after getting my GED two years ago. I'm at LAX. Yeah, so I'm working at LAX right now. LA Airport. Nice. What's one thing that most number of people experience? What, working at the airport? I guess during the holidays there was some girl that worked there. I had a crush on her, but she turned out to be a lesbian. She's beautiful. Yeah. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with a disease? No. Have you been diagnosed with a disease? I think when I was a youngster, like a teenager. 14, 15. No. Why did you stop? I just stopped. I went to a rehab or a placement when I was 15, 16, after I did a little bit of time. Then I AWOLed from there, I escaped, and then I went back to jail. So that's when it stopped. I'm sorry you're late. No problem. It's not your fault. Do you think it's their disease? Excuse me? Did your parents just help you? It wasn't when I was a teenager. Tell me more about that. What, when I was a teenager? When I was a teenager, I was very restless. I was very destructive, you know? How have you been doing lately? I'm not going forward as fast as I want to. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's kind of hard, but it is what it is. Have you done anything to avoid it? To avoid what? Going forward? I guess I could try to move faster, but I've accomplished my goals in life so far. I just want to accomplish more, but it's taking longer than I thought it would. Excuse me? Yeah, I guess. Are there? Yeah, it's like mood swings, I guess. Mood swings? Are you triggered by something? It could be just something small and I'll just snap, you know? When was the last time you had a mood swing? Oh, all the time. Yesterday. Maybe today. Really? How did you fool around with me? Angry. How hard is it? Yeah, I guess it's kind of hard to control anger, you know? When you're going through a few things in your life that aren't very pleasant, you know? Do you think you're going to be able to control it? No. Okay. How are your best friends? My best friends? My best friends? Excuse me? They describe me just, I guess, as a character. Just very outgoing, you know, good sense of humor. But, you know, we all have our issues, you know? They understand when I am going through something or I get mad about something easily or I could just laugh too right after that, you know? Very outgoing, smart, intelligent, strong. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? The goals that I've accomplished the past few years especially. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just the jobs. Getting the GED, getting the job at LAX I always wanted. That's great. Thank you. Is that even your address? Yeah. Yes. Can you give me an example of that? Oh, just decisions I made, I guess, when I was younger in life. Even up to the past few years, but nothing major in the past few years. It's pretty much the decisions I made when I was young, you know, younger in life. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Well, to stay in school and, I don't know, to not join a gang. Just to stay in school pretty much and to control the anger issues I had back then. What made you decide to do that? To do what? To do what? Let's come back to that earlier. When was the last time you were in the house? I don't know. Today. Happy to be here. That's great. What are some things that you really put into your life? Um, going, exercising, going to the gym and working out. Going to the beach, hanging out with family members of mine, you know. Nice. Friends, yeah. What would you say is something you've best followed in? My best qualities? Just that, uh, qualities. Just that I'm a neat person. I'm outgoing, you know, I don't know. Qualities. Qualities meaning what? Whatever comes to your mind. What do you mean by qualities? What comes to your mind? Give me a definition of qualities. Okay. I think I've asked everything on the phone. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay, bye. Can I take her home with me? Is she, um, is she supposed to be a psychiatrist or can I hire her? Okay.",

         " Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. I'm fine. This is a little bit strange, you know, talking to a virtual human. I was born, I was born in LA. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived in the city of San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I grew up in San Diego. I was born in LA. I was raised out in the suburbs. I've lived all over Los Angeles. I've lived in the valley, Long Beach, and now I'm in Culver City. Awesome. What are some things you really like about LA? There's great food here. The weather is great most of the time. There's a lot of sunshine. I think that's really great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? That is a much longer list I would like to get out of here. The traffic, I think that's number one. I think everybody hates the traffic. And everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to get together with anybody. Everybody's so devoted to their jobs and then we're sitting in traffic a lot too. Yeah. What did you study at school? I studied Marine Biology. Wow. That sounds interesting. Why did you decide to do that? I went to school and I originally studied graphic design and I found that kind of unfulfilling. So I took a trip for a while, traveled around the world, and started scuba diving. And I realized that I really loved Marine Biology. So that's how I got into it. Nice. What's your dream job? Everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since I just graduated. I think I would like to... I think maybe managing a research... I'm not really sure. I think I would like to... Something in Tropical Marine Ecology, maybe managing a preserve, something like that. It's a hard question to answer. I do. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I traveled for eight months in Central America. And I visited a lot of different countries. I... I traveled a lot. I traveled a lot. I went to different countries. I went scuba diving. Wow. What are some things that you're doing now? I think intolerance, injustice in the world. I think intolerance, injustice in the world. Those are probably the things that get me the most fired up. What do you do when you're annoyed? Brant to my boyfriend. Does that count? How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. Very few people have seen me angry. To the point where I'm kind of yelling and screaming angry. I don't know. I just don't get there. I think that I'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper, so I keep it under control. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone you loved or loved without? It was yesterday, actually. I argued with my boyfriend about getting a job. I was talking about taking a job somewhere, and he was being very supportive. I really wanted him to say, No, don't go take that job for six months because I would miss you. He was just being supportive. We kind of argued about that. It was ridiculous, so I ended up laughing. That's good. What do you do to relax? Meditate, exercise, go out in nature. Just unplug, get myself away from a computer, away from technology, away from people. Okay. How close are you to your family? I would say not really. I'm an only child, and it's just me and my parents, and we're very, very dissimilar. For example, I'm a pretty adventurous person. I like learning, and my parents are couch potatoes. They like to watch reality television. We don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activities. I love them and everything, but there's not too much common ground. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Yes. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I don't think I'm a social person. I think I'm a social person. I think I'm a social person. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I seem to find most social encounters to be draining, whereas my boyfriend, for example, he derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people. For me, it's always a little bit the opposite. I have to recharge. How are your best friends? I'm not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He's kind of my best friend. I'm not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He would probably say passionate, intelligent. He always tells me that I'm really hard on myself, which is true. Dedicated, loyal. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm just proud of who I am. I don't know if that's the answer that most people give, but I think that I'm really proud of who I am. I try really hard. I've done a lot of things in my life. I'm a really good person. I think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind, and I consider myself a kind person that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so I'm proud of that. That's so good to hear. Have you ever served in military? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I was probably about 15 at the time, so I think 17 years ago. You were very young weren't you? Yes. What got you to see the doctor? I was diagnosed with depression. I called my parents and let them know, and at that point they took me in for treatment. That wasn't the first time I had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist, but before it was more, they thought I had ADHD. So it was, I think, my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help. Do you still go to therapy now? I haven't for about three years. I was checking in with a parole officer. I just wasn't enjoying the relationship I had, but I still have a psychiatrist that I go to for med checks. That sucks. Do you feel like they're useful? I do think it's useful if you have the right therapist. I think if you don't have a good relationship with a therapist, it can be incredibly harmful. I have talked to people that have had bad experiences How have you been feeling lately? Lately I've been a little bit down. I should say a little bit more down than usual because I graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things 24-7 has come to an end. Without the routine, it's been a little bit weird finding out what to do with my... finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time. It's also been a little bit depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in California. That sounds really hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Almost impossible. Ever since I was a little kid, I had trouble falling asleep. About four years ago, it became really, really bad or I just couldn't sleep through the night. I was getting about four hours of sleep. Sometimes I would wake up every hour and I would wake up in the morning just to complete rec. For about four years, I've been taking trazodone so I can sleep. What are you looking down for these days? Have you ever seen Fight Club? You're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's pretty much like that. I'm just a complete panicked, anxious rec. I lose my ability to deal with things. I'm much more likely to lose my temper. I can't regulate my moods. I'm just really volatile. When was the last time you were happy? Probably a few months ago. I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a week, and I was just really, really happy. I think that I may have been on a trip, gone away for a weekend, and forgotten to take my medicine with me or something like that and then I can't sleep and so that's what happens. When was the last time you felt really happy? Really happy. I don't know. It's easier for me to keep track of when I feel really, really bad. Really happy. I guess I felt happy on New Year's Day and really happy on New Year's Eve, which was 10 days ago. I was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to Palm Springs and Joshua Tree and it was really nice to see them. I don't get to see them very often because I've been in school and I've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to real life. That's great. What would you say as somebody who has followed you? I think that I'm kind, I'm considerate, I'm tolerant, I'm pretty open-minded, I'm aware of my faults. I just try to be nice to everybody and I'm very curious about the world and things that I don't know about. I really like to learn. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think that I was in a relationship with my boyfriend and he was really nice to me What's one of your most memorable experiences? Off the top of my head, first thing that comes to mind is diving the blue hole in Belize. It was really amazing. It was me and my friends. We just jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this limestone sinkhole and it's really, really, really blue and you just drop down to about 140 feet in something like two minutes. We did it pretty quick, not everybody could do it that quick. As you go down, you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge, they're larger than a human because it's this cave system and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you. That was pretty good. What are some things you like to do for fun? I'm trying to remember that at the moment. I haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school. I guess reading, hiking, just being together with my friends, doing relatively low key things, going to movies, having dinner parties, cooking, playing with my cat. Is there anything you can remember? Not that I can really think of. I've made mistakes in my life, but I'm still here so it can't be that bad. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't know, hang in there. Hold on to your clothes because the 90s are coming back in fashion. What are some things that you believe have been a good way? There's someone that's been a positive influence on you. I think that's great. Especially the last year, he's really inspired me. He quit drinking, he quit smoking. He's made a lot of positive changes in his life. I know that those things aren't easy. So to see someone overcome that really inspired me. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thanks for having me.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nOkay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming. Okay. Yes. I'm fine. This is a little bit strange, you know, talking to a virtual human. I was born in LA and raised out in the suburbs. I've lived in the city of San Diego and grew up there. I've lived all over Los Angeles, including the valley, Long Beach, and now I'm in Culver City. Awesome. What are some things you really like about LA? There's great food here. The weather is great most of the time. There's a lot of sunshine. I think that's really great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? That is a much longer list I would like to get out of here. The traffic, I think that's number one. I think everybody hates the traffic. And everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to get together with anybody. Everybody's so devoted to their jobs and then we're sitting in traffic a lot too. Yeah. What did you study at school? I studied Marine Biology. Wow. That sounds interesting. Why did you decide to do that? I went to school and I originally studied graphic design and I found that kind of unfulfilling. So I took a trip for a while, traveled around the world, and started scuba diving. And I realized that I really loved Marine Biology. So that's how I got into it. Nice. What's your dream job? Everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since I just graduated. I think I would like to... maybe managing a research... I'm not really sure. Something in Tropical Marine Ecology, maybe managing a preserve, something like that. It's a hard question to answer. I do. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I traveled for eight months in Central America. And I visited a lot of different countries. I traveled a lot. I went to different countries. I went scuba diving. Wow. What are some things that you're doing now? I think intolerance, injustice in the world. Those are probably the things that get me the most fired up. What do you do when you're annoyed? Brant to my boyfriend. Does that count? How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. It takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I kind of blow my top. Very few people have seen me angry. To the point where I'm kind of yelling and screaming angry. I don't know. I just don't get there. I think that I'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper, so I keep it under control. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone you loved or loved without? It was yesterday, actually. I argued with my boyfriend about getting a job. I was talking about taking a job somewhere, and he was being very supportive. I really wanted him to say, No, don't go take that job for six months because I would miss you. He was just being supportive. We kind of argued about that. It was ridiculous, so I ended up laughing. That's good. What do you do to relax? Meditate, exercise, go out in nature. Just unplug, get myself away from a computer, away from technology, away from people. Okay. How close are you to your family? I would say not really. I'm an only child, and it's just me and my parents, and we're very, very dissimilar. For example, I'm a pretty adventurous person. I like learning, and my parents are couch potatoes. They like to watch reality television. We don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activities. I love them and everything, but there's not too much common ground. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Yes. I think I'm a very social introvert, but I seem to find most social encounters to be draining, whereas my boyfriend, for example, he derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people. For me, it's always a little bit the opposite. I have to recharge. How are your best friends? I'm not sure I have a best friend, but I guess I'll say my boyfriend. He's kind of my default best friend. He would probably say passionate, intelligent. He always tells me that I'm really hard on myself, which is true. Dedicated, loyal. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm just proud of who I am. I don't know if that's the answer that most people give, but I think that I'm really proud of who I am. I try really hard. I've done a lot of things in my life. I'm a really good person. I think it's kind of rare to find people that are kind, and I consider myself a kind person that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place, so I'm proud of that. That's so good to hear. Have you ever served in military? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed?

My parents were the ones who took me in for treatment, initially thinking I might have ADHD.\n\nLately, I've been feeling more down than usual, especially since graduating. Losing my 24/7 school routine has made it weird to find ways to be productive and know what to do with my time. It's also been depressing to realize that my intelligence and good grades don't always translate to real-world skills, and there aren't many marine biology jobs in California.\n\nMy sleep has been a major struggle. Since I was a kid, I've had trouble falling asleep, but about four years ago, it got really bad. I was only getting about four hours of sleep, sometimes waking up every hour, and I'd wake up feeling like a complete wreck. For the past four years, I've been taking trazodone to help me sleep. When I'm feeling down, it's like I become a complete panicked, anxious wreck. I lose my ability to deal with things, I'm much more likely to lose my temper, and I just can't regulate my moods; I become really volatile.

         "Everything isn't very well for me. I can feel agitated sometimes, especially when I'm 'off the ground,' though I wouldn't say I feel 'down.' I don't really get 'super, super happy'; I'm more 'even-minded,' 'even-kill,' and I try to stay 'pretty level.' I guess there's just no reason to get 'super, super happy.'\n\nMy hunger control varies, and when asked about it, I felt like you wouldn't really want to hear about it. It's tough for me to get into the next stage of my life, and that seems to depend on whether I'm sleeping alone or with someone. I don't visit my hometown often, preferring to just call. My social life is somewhat limited, mostly with my girlfriend, who I think is cool but a bit arrogant. I know I need to be more patient with her. I've also been told I stare down.\n\nPlaying my guitar and flying planes are things that make me feel good and are when I last felt 'really happy.'

Well, unfortunately when I was young my sister was kidnapped so when my children were growing up I worried about them a lot and I didn't let them do things a lot on their own. Now it's easy because they're grown and they live on their own so it's a lot easier now but you still worry even though they're grown. I'm sorry, what did you say? Oh my goodness, they're spoiled rotten. They have everything. Waking up when my kids were younger on Christmas Day I loved it. No. Yes. It's been exactly two years and two months. Loneliness, depression, especially after I didn't have any family members left in the United States so I went to counselor and then the group therapy. Yes. I mostly enjoy group therapy because you're sitting in a group with other people talking about your likes, your dislikes, your problems and sometimes somebody else is going through the same thing you are and you can share what you're going through and what can help make it better. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It's affected me a lot. It's helped me cope with things. It's nice to have somebody else to talk to. Yes, I didn't want to admit it but after a while and feeling depressed for so long I knew I had to do something. How have you been feeling lately? Pretty good. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just getting more positive, better. That's good. Do you still go to therapy now? Yes. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? It's not. It's about 50-50. Some nights I sleep good and some nights I don't. That sucks. What are you likely to do to improve on? Lack of energy the next day. How hard is that? It's hard, especially if you get two nights in a row of no sleep. Wow. When was the last time you felt really happy? During the holidays, so a couple of weeks ago. How did you feel about the holidays? I felt good. Holidays always try to, you know, Christmas trees and kids and everything. So usually is a good time makes me feel good. Nice. What are you most proud of in your life? I was married and raising two children and having two kids. I'm very proud of that. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoy. Wow. That's great. Thanks. How did you decide to decide? Well, I went from full-time to part-time work and there's not as much work in the automotive field. So I decided to go back to school. Easygoing, fun, easy to get along with. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My mom. She's raised four kids single-handedly and was a very hard worker. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't give up. Be positive and anything you try to accomplish, Ken, you can do it. Is that anything you regret? Not going back to school sooner. Have you done anything to avoid it? No, because I was raising two kids by myself. So now that they're grown, I have no excuse. So I'm doing it. That's good. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm friendly. I'm a hard worker and most of the time I'm easy to get along with. Can you tell me about that? Like I said, I'm a hard worker. If you give me work to do, I'll do it. Most of the time I'm in a good mood so I'm easy to get along with. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Like I say, bike riding or walks on the beach. The beach is very relaxing.

I sought help by going to a counselor and then group therapy. Group therapy has been particularly helpful because I can share my problems with others who are going through similar experiences, and we can support each other. Seeing a therapist has helped me cope with things and it's nice to have someone to talk to. I initially didn't want to admit I was depressed, but after feeling that way for so long, I knew I had to do something. Lately, I've been feeling pretty good, getting more positive and better. My sleep isn't great; it's about 50-50, some nights I sleep well, others I don't. This lack of sleep often leads to a lack of energy the next day, which is especially hard if I have two consecutive nights of no sleep.

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions at the start, and please feel free to tell me that. Your answers are really confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty well. That's good. Where are you from originally? From New York. Really? Why did you move to LA? To go to college. Well, to San Diego to go to college, and then later to LA. Cool. What did you study at school? Aerospace engineering. That's nice. How did you decide to do that? I was really good at math and science, and I had an interest in airplanes. Are you still working on that? No. What do you do now? I'm a life coach. Cool. What's your dream job? To be a life coach and help people. Tell me more about that. I really like how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that I made a contribution to their life. That's so good to hear. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. It's great. I really like to do outdoor things, and I like doing things by the ocean. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic and how crowded it is. Do you have roommates? Yeah. How do you like your living situation? I live with my girlfriend, so I like it. How do you know them? We met on eHarmony. How close are you to them? Really close. That's great. There's someone that's been a positive influence on you. My meditation teacher. Can you tell me about that? I used to be very shy and self-conscious and have a lot of anxiety. I worry a lot about the future. I took classes, meditation and yoga classes, and it really helped me to be more confident and more relaxed and enjoy life a lot more. That's good. What do you do to relax? I meditate and do yoga. What are some things that you don't really like about LA? I don't get mad that often, but frustrated. I would say being stuck in traffic or people that do mean things to other people for no real reason. What do you do when you're annoyed? I usually talk to somebody about it if I can. That's good. How are you at controlling your temper? When was the last time you argued with someone? How did you feel about that? What did you do in that moment? Do you feel that way often? That's good. What are some things you like to do to find? What's one of your most memorable experiences? A trip I took to India and Nepal for six weeks. Can you travel a lot? Yeah, as much as I can. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love to explore. I've loved to explore ever since I was a little kid. I love seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures. I love backpacking in the wilderness and exploring nature. I'd love to hear about your trips. Cool. I went on a trip to India and Nepal. It was my first time ever there. The first week and a half I was with a big group of people and did a meditation and yoga retreat. I went whitewater rafting on the Ganga River. Then I went off on my own for the rest of the trip. I went backpacking in Nepal with a guide there. It was really beautiful in the Annapurna area. Then I went back into India and explored the area up near Tibet. Then I went to Rajasthan and to a tiger park in Madai Pradesh. It was really close to tigers. How did you decide to do that? I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this trip. I'd always wanted to go to India. So I decided to do it. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it was really fun. How are your best friends? They're caring and enthusiastic for life. That's good. Have you ever served in a military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with insomnia? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I don't sleep as well as I did when I was younger. For the most part, I sleep well. Once in a while, I'll wake up at four or five in the morning when I want to sleep until seven. I'll not be able to get back to sleep. In general, it's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I feel tired and not as motivated as usual. I sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon. Okay. Have you ever studied using a video app? No. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago? I guess, too, I wish I would have invested money or bought a house or something when I was younger. That would probably be the advice I would give myself. Okay. What would you say is one of your best qualities? I am empathetic with other people, positive and have a positive outlook on life. I'm very determined when I decide to do something. I'll figure out how to do it even if it's challenging. I'm very creative in figuring out creative ways to do things. I guess probably the strongest thing is that I'm pretty balanced. I'm very organized but I'm also pretty creative. I'm pretty balanced that way. That's good. How close are you to your family? Pretty close. Much closer than I was when I was younger. Although I'd say I'm probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual community with me than I'm able to get to my family. Okay. What are some things that you do that you think are good? Being outdoors and nature and exercising and also singing. What are you most proud of in your life? The fact that I've gone with, followed my heart and done what I wanted to do versus going with what I think I should do. That's great. When was the last time you felt really happy? I guess yesterday. I spent the day by the beach and just bicycled and went skating and visited some old friends there. How did you feel about that? I felt very relaxed and invigorated. I also felt like I missed living by the beach because I used to live really close to the beach. I guess a little bit sad that I didn't live there anymore but really happy to be there. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Goodbye. Okay.",

And so I had to actually like act, you know, I'm in the audience but I had to like pretend like I was interested in what you have to say but I looked so I kept looking at her like that like there's something wrong my eyes. No, I just saw I was in a doctor's office and they had it on and like oh god it was funny because there was these guys like winking at me on the way out like that's celebrity and I'm like I can pay to do audience sitting there. It's like I hated every minute of it but we got sewing machines, free sewing machines, $200 sewing machines that day. It was yeah, so it was worth it but I was so embarrassed. Yeah, only if you get stuff it's worth it otherwise they're so stupid. The shows are so I can't believe that's why I don't watch television. It's so embarrassing. Okay, right on. Okay, this is so weird. Oh gosh, I hope she's nice to me. I hope so. Okay, hello. Yes, fine, just tired. California, from Hollywood. Not too much. It's not too many things I like about it. The people, it's not clean, too much crime, too many drugs. Makeup and hair is a little bit not too much. I just survived very difficult. Okay, I'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career but I just want probably to get married and have a little security, that's all. Just be a wife again. A little bit close but everybody's pretty much passed away. I play Farmville on Facebook. I'm good. I don't really have a temper. I was my ex-husband about money. People lying, cheating, conniving drug addicts, you know, just ugly people, people that are hideous in the inside, you know. Jesus Christ, that's about it. My mother when she was alive, well she still has positive influence but nobody really but Jesus. I don't know. I can't really think of one right now. Gosh, oh I guess like maybe modeling, that was pretty cool. Yeah, yeah. I was just kind of surreal like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff, you know. I didn't understand how it could have been me but then my photographer told me he was like, well someone has to do it, it might as well be you. So I will and it's true. So that was cool. Just kind of fell into it by accident. I've always I wish I did it, I took it further but I couldn't really happy. I don't remember. I really don't. I don't really have a best friend but I'm sure anybody would describe me as outgoing. Yeah, no. Yes, I was 1984. Yeah, I couldn't deal with it so I had to see a psychiatrist. Horrified, couldn't sleep, panicked, major anxiety. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes, I do. It could be if you see the right doctor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody and hopefully they can give you answers. Most of them don't. They try to find the answers inside of you, get it out of you but it's just good to be able to talk to somebody that's kind of bias neutral. Really depressed, extremely depressed. Yeah, poverty. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm a lot more tired. I sleep longer and I am I just don't have the drive, motivation that I did before. Just try to be strong, just have to get through it, you know. Yes, yes. Not really. I'm an open book. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, I would say perfectionist but that's not really a good quality because it can get dangerous. I'm just artistic. I'm really good at a lot of things but I'm a good hairdresser and makeup artist. I crochet and knit really well, make jewelry. I'm not good with computers or phones though, electronics. Yeah. I keep a perfect house. Or well, when I'm not depressed like this. I was a perfect wife. The perfect wife. So, yeah. But not anymore. Cause I'm divorced now. But it wasn't me. It was him. He was on drugs. So he chose, the drugs were too much problems. Yeah, it does. It's really hard. Because it's like the drugs are his mistress. How do you know that? How do I what? How do you know that? Who? Let's see now. Yes. No. No. But... Well, I don't really consider myself an introvert. Yeah. I have a lot of regrets. But there really wasn't anything I could do about it. So there's really no point in regretting it. Cause you do what you do and you make a decision and then it's already done so why regret it? Why bother? You know? What advice can you give yourself? Make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol. That's one for sure. That was the only question I didn't ask. I didn't know. There's a lot of things. A lot of stuff. You know? I don't know. Just the things that I can do. That my talents, that's it. Why do you think you need to do something like that? Um... Well, if I can have my Starbucks and my Orange Gina. I drink Orange Gina every day. I smoke cigarettes unfortunately but it's always good to have those because I'm addicted to them. And then if I can eat something really good and healthy at night time and... Well basically if I have something to do, if I have a goal, somewhere to go, like today even puts me in a good mood. Yeah. Otherwise I'd be afraid that I'd stay home and just lay in bed or farm all day. I could farm for 8 hours on Farmville. Yeah. Okay. I think that's all for me. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So I press the button. Okay. You're good. She's good. Except for you know, it's like the one eye... Can she hear me by the way? The one eye always kind of moves weird. Oh does it? Yeah it's kind of distracting. Yeah the one... Yeah. She kind of made a mistake on one part.",
         "I'm really depressed, extremely depressed, and a lot more tired than I used to be. I sleep longer now, and I just don't have the drive or motivation I had before. My first experience with this was in 1984; I couldn't deal with it then and had to see a psychiatrist because I was horrified, couldn't sleep, panicked, and had major anxiety. Now, when I'm depressed like this, I don't keep a perfect house like I used to. I could stay home and just lay in bed or farm all day, sometimes farming for 8 hours on Farmville. I'm getting a little old to be thinking of a career, and I just want to get married and have a little security, just be a wife again. I try to be strong and just have to get through it. Poverty is a big factor in my current depression, and my divorce was really hard because my ex-husband's drug use was like his mistress. I don't really have a best friend, but talking to a psychiatrist can be helpful because it's good to talk to somebody who's bias neutral. To get through the day, it helps if I have my Starbucks and Orange Gina, and if I can eat something good and healthy at night.

         " collection. Now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. I'm going to put the doorbell back over here. When she's done, she'll let you know and you can hit the doorbell. Okay? Alright. Okay. Yes. Very well. New York. This turned the volume up a little bit. For a change. That's good. I wanted to see what Los Angeles was about. Probably took a year or two. Well, you know, being away from my family, being away from what I was used to in New York, the neighborhoods, the people, and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here. Well, the weather. Can't beat the weather. It's generally always nice. It's not too hot. It's not too cold. It's creative. I do like movies. I like the beach. The traffic. There's a lot of traffic. Sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places. I was a history major. I do demonstrations in high-end supermarkets. To be a screenwriter. That's one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles. It's hard because I don't always maintain focus and motivation. I let other things distract me. I've always been interested in films ever since I was a child. I just always was writing and had an active imagination. In the last probably almost ten years I've traveled more than I had in the past. Well, I've always traveled, even as a kid, my parents would travel around. So, yes. Seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am. Seeing how they live and taking in the sights. I went to Kenya. That was probably one of the best trips I ever went on. On the safari and just going out in a jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible. Oh yeah, that's one of the great experiences of my life. I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called Charmel Shake, which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world, which is hard to believe that Egypt would, but it was just amazing. I didn't go scuba diving. I went snorkeling. What do I do to relax? I like to listen to music. I like to watching movies helps me relax because it takes me out of whatever might be on my mind. I do meditate every day. I like to take walks in nature that's always calming, especially down by the ocean. It depends. Sometimes I get angry and lose my temper. A lot of times I'll do a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself, which is something I've recently learned how to do. This is very helpful. Also, since I meditate, I don't get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past. Some things that make me really mad. I guess I think of injustice in the world or done to people when it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along and make the world better. What was the last thing you argued with someone? Last night I went to a movie screening of an independent film and I didn't think it was done very well. We had a fun argument about the movie. That just happened yesterday, so that's on my mind. Is there anything you regret? Is there anything I regret? Yeah, there have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had taken them and pursued them. Certain jobs. When I first got to Los Angeles, I had an opportunity to become a GRIP and I probably should have pursued that. How did I decide to do that? I don't really understand the questions. Take advantage of every opportunity that came my way. I think saying yes to any opportunity is very important and no matter how you feel, you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you want to do. No, but I've been depressed in my life. For the most part, I've been feeling good. Sometimes I feel a little blue. Sometimes if I allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down. I can usually get out of it pretty quickly. Sometimes financial concerns, sometimes an opportunity, how do I explain it? Financial is one way that if I made another decision, I might have more money or my life would be different. Not really. I feel pretty much the same. What got me to seek help for? Let's come back to that. Generally, talking to someone has helped when I did do that. Pretty easy. I don't have problems sleeping. Usually I'm grumpy. If I don't sleep well, I feel tired and irritable. How would my best friend describe me? That's a good question. I'm definitely friendly and outgoing. A little bit secretive. Probably that I should be, they'd like to see me more accomplished in attaining my goals and maybe a little happier. I think it's tough, it depends. Sometimes I'm very introverted because I do like to write, so that means that I have to spend time alone. When I come out of that, I'm extroverted. I don't really see myself as one hard way or the other. It all depends on the situation and my mood. My best qualities. I think I'm caring. I think I'm intelligent. I think I'm funny. I'm outgoing. I have a likeable personality. People have said that. I'm engaging, but not oppressive or overly engaging. There's a cool detachment. I'm creative, intuitive. Yes. Last time I felt really happy. I don't know, I woke up this morning, I was pretty happy. I had breakfast, I was happy. Sun was shining. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think, like I said, going to Kenya was a memorable experience. I do remember snorkeling was a really great experience. I just remember seeing all the colors in the ocean and feeling the sun, the powerful sun on my back. Almost beyond, almost beyond like human in a way. Just more in touch with everything, the universe. It would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day, but... What am I most proud of in my life? I think I've helped people and sometimes when they were in crisis, I've written some screenplays, I've had some good relationships. Good relationships, just being connected with someone else, spending time with them and connecting on emotional and physical and mental levels. It could be a song that I hear on the radio. It could be a lot of times looking forward to something. If I'm going to go to a movie, go bowling, hang out with people, looking at work and going to work and feeling productive, it puts me in a good mood. You're welcome. Bye bye. Sometimes she would ask me, it would sort of tweak, and then it would ask me this question about not being able to do it. I don't remember it really getting specific like that. Oh, like what? Do you remember what question you're talking about? It kind of asks me, well, are you depressed? Sometimes. It will explain that, and then it was like, well... Then it did something, and then it was like, well... Did therapy help? And I'm like, wow, we... There was no bridge to that conversation. Got it, got it.",

Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are welcome. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from a suburb of LA, from the San Gabriel Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity of the city. I've lived other places and it's just not as happy here. I feel like I can really thrive here. So I just like LA. Like all the things that are so close together. And there's a lot of interesting things that are totally different parts of the city, just miles away from each other. Yeah. I see. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't like the traffic. I don't like all the cars. But I can live with it. There's not that much I don't like. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied music, vocal performance, I studied music technology, things like that. Awesome. Are you still working on that? Yes. What do you do now? Right now I sing at an opera company. But I do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the LA Opera. So I do have a day job. I work at a call center. They cater mostly to performers and actors and things like that. It's really good because if I get a call, I can call in and change my shift very easily. So it's actually a pretty good gig. I do some technology gigs sometimes. I do some recording, some live sound stuff. But I kind of want to get away from that. I do some video work sometimes. But again, I want to get away from that. I want to go back to the... Because I find that performing is more interesting. I like being talent more than I like being crew. So I kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Sometimes. I mean, for my personal life, yeah. I do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people. But if I'm at home, I'd kind of rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever. I don't have too many close friends. But yeah, you know, I'd rather keep to myself. How close are you to your family? I'm moderately close to the family that I have left. I've actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so. Thank you. But I'm close to my husband. You know, I've got a couple of cousins I talk to and my aunt that I have an aunt that I talk to a bit. But it's not like we're interacting every day close together. But it's somewhat close. Okay. What do you do to relax? Mostly I sing or I read or I write or just hang out and try to... I hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in. And sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things, contacting my family, you know, through Facebook or whatever works. But mostly in my free time I create things. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I'd like to travel more. I like to travel by car a lot. I mean, my idea of having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. And I'd like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Particularly traveling by car, seeing the landscape change, seeing people change, feeling the vibrations of the area change. I like just seeing what's out there. And I know that there's a bigger world outside of where I am and where I live and my world. I like to see that. But I like to leave that too and go back to my own world. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Um, let's see. I think a trip that I like to take is to make the drive from here to Nevada, whether I go all the way to Vegas or just go to State Line. My cousin and I would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway, you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway. So we would take those. We just sort of impromptu with a day or two notice, just move things around, just take off. So those are actually trips that I like to make because I take off and then just come back. Sometimes the same day, sometimes overnight. Just small, short trips that aren't very involved, but you just get to go and you see things and see how, um, you know, the desert landscape looks in different seasons, how people react in different times of the year in different areas. So close to home, but not, but not close to home, close to home, but still a world away. So that because I don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever, but it's just little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head and things like that. I mean, because there's sort of a sense of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway. So I like doing that. The last time that happened was May of last year. So last time I was able to do that. We actually, my aunt came over with my cousin who's 10 years younger than I am. And we kind of grew up like sisters. And I was about to move away from the Inland Empire, which is where they live. So they kind of took me on a last hurrah. We drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while, but I didn't like it. So they kind of, I showed them some of the local sites around there and we came back and was, you know, an overnight trip, but we're driving the entire time. That's kind of interesting. Things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals or people who can't fight back. They're mean to them just because they can't fight back. And I actually like to see people who are as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you. So I think that's one thing that makes me really mad. Just being cruel or mean for no reason. You know, not for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it. That kind of really just makes me mad. When I'm annoyed, I'll try to just walk away from the situation. And if the situation is just unfollowing me, then I'll wind up lashing out somehow, either verbally just cutting them with a quip or, you know, I rarely will yell at somebody. But I'll try to, you know, if I try to walk away and defuse it, if that doesn't work, then I'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me. That usually works. Not like legal trouble or anything, because usually I'll find a way to get them to leave me alone. There's not really like big trouble, but I think because it is off-putting and it's not the expected reaction. And that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that will work and get people away from me. So it's not really in trouble. And if it is trouble, it's usually trouble that it's from the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because due to the situation I can get out of. So as long as they leave me alone, you know, I'll walk away from it. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody, like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my... What was that in your mind? The last thing I could think of was I argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law because she's got dementia. And so one of the reasons we came out here from the Inland Empire was to take care of her because she won't go anywhere but LA. I mean, she's like hardcore Angelino. We know we are that, we're that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere. But so we came out here to take care of her and he wants her to be able to stay in her apartment. And I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us. But she wants to stay where she is because she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process. But he wants her to stay where she... He wants her to be able to have what she wants because he's a mama's boy like I am. I'm a mama's girl. Even though I lost my mom like four years ago, I'm still a mama's girl. And I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much. That's what they want. So you want to get it for them. And because they, you know, that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it. And you want to do that for them now, like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about, somebody you feel deserves it. But it's kind of dangerous for her, you know, and I don't want this thing to happen to her. Yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as she can. Because I know the disease that she has is going to erase who she is eventually. And eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her 24 hour medically trained care. But until then, we can handle it amongst ourselves. It's not that bad. But it's getting worse. She really has no business living by herself anymore. So the solution right now is he stays there most of the time with her. And I go back to our house. And it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I do I handle the outside things. I run the errands. I take her to the store, things like that. He does the day to day things, make sure she has she eats, make sure she, you know, has clean clothes, things like that. So, I mean, it's a partnership. It's a it's a dual effort. It's very much a dual effort. But I would like her to move in with us. So that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling, screaming argument, but lively discussion, you know, and debate. It's not insurmountable. I mean, life's not going to be easy ever. And if it is, it's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life, it's not going to be easy. But you deal with it and you move on. The most positive influence, I think, have been probably my mother and my grandmother, because my mom was pretty much a single mom. And my grandmother helped raise me. And they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it. So, I mean, I think I have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperament to myself. But they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that, you know, life's going to go on. You know, my mom would say to me, when you're 40, you're 40, whether you're working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life. I think that was a big influence on how I've lived my life since she's passed. I regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have clouded some of my decisions. Now, I do have underlying conditions. Everybody in my family is diabetic, and I didn't take care of that when she was the last year for life because I was too busy wanting to get her home. My focus was to get her home. So I didn't eat right. I didn't take my insulin right. I wanted to make myself insulin resistant that year just because my blood sugar was so high for like a year. Eating just horrible foods when I did eat. So it really took a toll and it really actually made myself very sick. And I'm wondering, well, if I didn't, if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straight, my vision and my thoughts weren't completely weren't clouded. Would I have made some better decisions on her behalf, especially when she needed them? When she needed me to be to step in and make this his for because she wound up having a health catastrophe because she had kidney, she had kidney damage. I want to be kidney failure and her health insurance provider missed that. So she wanted having sort of this whole catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down. She wanted having a stroke at like 50. She had a small stroke and it just kind of went down from there. So I'm thinking, well, if I didn't, if I had taken care of better care of myself, would I have been able to take better care of her? And I know there wasn't anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death. But what if I if I would I have been able to make it easier on her? If I would have taken care of myself. That's like one huge regret that I have. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Oh, I know I am. But it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And I know other people, I can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings. And they can't, you know, be what I want them to be. And I know they're not going to be. But I still have, you know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to. Fit into my life in a way in the best way possible. But I know because they're other beings. And I'm not going to be able to do that for them. Then I can be able to do that for me. But it's still by ideals. So I have to sometimes have to look at and go, well, is this what I want? Because I want it or what is what they want and what's there is their decision or mine and it's theirs. I know it's there. So if you really care about somebody, you're just going to support them and go with them. But it's still kind of hard for me. And I know I got to get over it. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago. Probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because I went up taking care of my mother. I mean, she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college and I had a job lined up and I had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her. I think I would have been more aggressive about starting my own life, getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her, getting my own job history, my own credit history, things like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years. So I think I probably would have done that. But to myself, just do that and keep who you are and learn to separate. You who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of yourself. That's probably what I would have and do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself. That's probably the advice I would give myself 10 years ago. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, but probably because I haven't gone to a doctor about it because I don't want to know. I mean, it's not, I know there have been times in my life where I've been severely depressed and it's usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it, but I'd rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. Can you give me an example of that? After my mother had died, it had been this long battle for a year that we lost. I didn't know if I was to blame for that. It's like logically I knew I wasn't, but how could I convince myself of that? Two weeks after she died, I wound up with pulmonary embolisms in one in each lung because I didn't take care of myself for a year. I feel, oh, I'm 30 years old. If, you know, whatever I do to myself, I can get over. No, turns out no. But I wound up having to take more medication because of that. It's been a fight to get my own health back to get to be able to get out of that depression because so much of my life was based on being my mother's daughter. All of a sudden I didn't. It's like the rug was pulled out. My like bottom fell out of my world after that. So that was the pretty pretty much sent me into a deep depression. I'm I almost got divorced because of it because I just didn't want anything anymore. So I was being really distant from my husband by then. At that time, we were married for about two years at that point, and I started getting very distant from him, just pushing everything away, just, you know, figuring out what am I going to do with the rest of my life now? And it's been a fight. And there are times when, no, I couldn't get up. Just stay in bed and sleep all day. You know, but then you realize that when my mother died, I had forecast look after two are mine to rehearse. I mean, well, they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own, you know, own supplies. I took that responsibility of doing it for them. So that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them. I mean, I could go without eating. I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't. They didn't, you know, so they actually got me up and. And made me go out and face things, even though I didn't want to, just didn't just kind of want to curl up and die. But that would have been my choice, not theirs. And they I mean, what would happen to them if I wasn't there to take care of them? They would have been, you know, sent to a shelter or whatever, probably. And maybe they would have not been re adopt me home and adopted by somebody else. Maybe they would have been killed for for me. I mean, for me making selfish decisions. So it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed. And that's actually been a motivating factor is to take because I figured out that it was just me. I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff. I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted. It wouldn't be a big deal. I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life. But I have a family to look after now. So I have to go out and do things. You know, I have to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day, day job. I have to, you know, but I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what I want to do with my life. But yet I have to take care of my family. Some work on a balance of the two. Very. But it's worth it. I mean, it would be very I'd have a lot less things to worry about if I just lived in my car and said, forget it. But keeping a residence down, paying bills, things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it. You know, if you want you want any if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through that. And I know that. But it gets hard. Sometimes you do want to give up. But then it's like, well, what's the alternative? I mean, I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did, I wouldn't do anything. I have to be slightly uncomfortable or I'm not going to do anything with myself. I'm just going to be content. Just hang out all day, stay in bed, hang out with my cats or whatever. And I wouldn't get anything done. I see. How do you even feel? Very anxious and nervous. And I mean, what if. I don't find enough, you know, enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever. What if? You know, what if I can't. Keep. Assemblance of stability in my life, and it's actually hard work to be stable. And I know it's hard work to be stable, but what you know, it's just a lot of what ifs. And I don't think it's things that haven't happened. And it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened. And I know that, but it's still have it still creeps in. So that's actually a source of. Anxiety. The internal anxiety go by getting things done, figuring things out, making a solid plan and going for it. But I know it's a cycle and I'll go from being really anxious and oh, my God, what am I going to do? What am I going to do? Just saying, OK, what is. The fundamental thing I need to take care of here. I mean, what is just extraneous and what can what is what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue? And so. Figure out how to figure things out that way. And then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit, but then something will pop up and the what ifs will come up again. I'll have to. Figure it out again, but I know it's a cycle. I know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it, you get over it pretty quickly. You get through it. The last time I felt really happy. I don't know. Like. Huh. Good question. But that actually surprisingly stumped me. Because I do feel happy sometimes, sometimes not so much. Sometimes it's kind of in the middle. Really like over joyously happy. I don't know. I have not. I can't think of when that happened. I don't know. I don't know. You don't know perceptions of other people. I mean. Probably as somebody who. Oddly enough, somebody who is laid back and you know. Handle things as they come, but I don't see myself as that at all. And so it. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to. Hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to to survive and get things done. That. And I can do it creatively and I try to. Strive for balance. Probably. Probably the best things about me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? That I'm doing basically what I want with my life, which even though it's not all easy, it's not. I'm not financially well off or anything. It's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives because I have an aunt that I really don't talk to who and the reason why I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable. I mean, she's got a career that she. It's more of a job that she fell into. Because my older aunt loves animals, but didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it. She had a stable business for a long time. But her, you know, she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had actually my cousin's father. Actually, my cousin's father went and kind of stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business. And she kind of she retired early because between that and the arthritis, she wanted retiring early. She employed my younger aunt, who is still a dog groomer, but she hates it. And it's like change your life. If you hate your life so much, change it. And I think the thing I'm most proud of is. Yeah, I'm not as financially well off as she is, but I'm doing what I want with my life. You know, I can be creative. I can have creative people around me, people who I actually like to talk to around me. People I actually like in my life and be happy with that. And I see a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say I'm not like that. That I'm actually doing what I want, even though there are sacrifices. I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nSo, now I'm going to start up the virtual human. She's going to chat with you for a bit. And then when she's done, she'll let you know. And I'll give you the number bell to let me know. Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are welcome. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm originally from a suburb of LA, from the San Gabriel Valley. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity of the city. I've lived other places and it's just not as happy here. I feel like I can really thrive here. So I just like LA. Like all the things that are so close together. And there's a lot of interesting things that are totally different parts of the city, just miles away from each other. Yeah. I see. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I don't know. I don't like the traffic. I don't like all the cars. But I can live with it. There's not that much I don't like. Okay. What did you study at school? I studied music, vocal performance, I studied music technology, things like that. Awesome. Are you still working on that? Yes. What do you do now? Right now I sing at an opera company. But I do have a day job because it doesn't pay that much unless you're actually working for the LA Opera. So I do have a day job. I work at a call center. They cater mostly to performers and actors and things like that. It's really good because if I get a call, I can call in and change my shift very easily. So it's actually a pretty good gig. I do some technology gigs sometimes. I do some recording, some live sound stuff. But I kind of want to get away from that. I do some video work sometimes. But again, I want to get away from that. I want to go back to the... Because I find that performing is more interesting. I like being talent more than I like being crew. So I kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life. Okay. Do you consider yourself an introvert? Sometimes. I mean, for my personal life, yeah. I do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people. But if I'm at home, I'd kind of rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever. I don't have too many close friends. But yeah, you know, I'd rather keep to myself. How close are you to your family? I'm moderately close to the family that I have left. I've actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so. Thank you. But I'm close to my husband. You know, I've got a couple of cousins I talk to and my aunt that I have an aunt that I talk to a bit. But it's not like we're interacting every day close together. But it's somewhat close. Okay. What do you do to relax? Mostly I sing or I read or I write or just hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts. Sometimes it doesn't work, but I try to do that and try to just clear everything and see what starts coming back in. And sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't. But mostly creating things, contacting my family, you know, through Facebook or whatever works. But mostly in my free time I create things. Okay. Do you travel a lot? I'd like to travel more. I like to travel by car a lot. I mean, my idea of having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip. And I'd like to travel more. I would love to travel for work things or whatever, but I don't get as much of an opportunity as I would like to to travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Particularly traveling by car, seeing the landscape change, seeing people change, feeling the vibrations of the area change. I like just seeing what's out there. And I know that there's a bigger world outside of where I am and where I live and my world. I like to see that. But I like to leave that too and go back to my own world. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Um, let's see. I think a trip that I like to take is to make the drive from here to Nevada, whether I go all the way to Vegas or just go to State Line. My cousin and I would take what we call exit one trips because once you get to the first exit of a highway, you're either in another state or you're at the end of the highway. So we would take those. We just sort of impromptu with a day or two notice, just move things around, just take off. So those are actually trips that I like to make because I take off and then just come back. Sometimes the same day, sometimes overnight. Just small, short trips that aren't very involved, but you just get to go and you see things and see how, um, you know, the desert landscape looks in different seasons, how people react in different times of the year in different areas. So close to home, but still a world away. Because I don't really have time to take like a two week vacation or whatever, but it's just little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head and things like that. I mean, because there's sort of a sense of meditation and Zen that you get on a highway that you don't get driving a freeway. So I like doing that. The last time that happened was May of last year. So last time I was able to do that. We actually, my aunt came over with my cousin who's 10 years younger than I am. And we kind of grew up like sisters. And I was about to move away from the Inland Empire, which is where they live. So they kind of took me on a last hurrah. We drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back because I actually lived in Vegas for a while, but I didn't like it. So they kind of, I showed them some of the local sites around there and we came back and was, you know, an overnight trip, but we're driving the entire time. That's kind of interesting. Things that are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or to children or to animals or people who can't fight back. They're mean to them just because they can't fight back. And I actually like to see people who are as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you. So I think that's one thing that makes me really mad. Just being cruel or mean for no reason. You know, not for people who can't fight back or for people who've done nothing to deserve it. That kind of really just makes me mad. When I'm annoyed, I'll try to just walk away from the situation. And if the situation is just unfollowing me, then I'll wind up lashing out somehow, either verbally just cutting them with a quip or, you know, I rarely will yell at somebody. But I'll try to, you know, if I try to walk away and defuse it, if that doesn't work, then I'll let them know that they're annoying me and get away from me. That usually works. Not like legal trouble or anything, because usually I'll find a way to get them to leave me alone. There's not really like big trouble, but I think because it is off-putting and it's not the expected reaction. And that's actually kind of cultivated in me that it's not the expected reaction because I know that will work and get people away from me. So it's not really in trouble. And if it is trouble, it's usually trouble that it's from the other person's perspective and it doesn't affect me at all because due to the situation I can get out of. So as long as they leave me alone, you know, I'll walk away from it. Okay. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody, like a family member or an outsider or somebody not in my... What was that in your mind? The last thing I could think of was I argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law because she's got dementia. And so one of the reasons we came out here from the Inland Empire was to take care of her because she won't go anywhere but LA. I mean, she's like hardcore Angelino. We know we are that, we're that in our nature, but we also know it's cheaper to live elsewhere. But so we came out here to take care of her and he wants her to be able to stay in her apartment. And I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us. But she wants to stay where she is because she can't see that there's inherent danger now because of the disease process. But he wants her to be able to have what she wants because he's a mama's boy like I am. I'm a mama's girl. Even though I lost my mom like four years ago, I'm still a mama's girl. And I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much. That's what they want. So you want to get it for them. And because they, you know, that happened when you were growing up when they tried to give you what you want because you wanted it. And you want to do that for them now, like sort of giving back to them somebody that you care about, somebody you feel deserves it. But it's kind of dangerous for her, you know, and I don't want this thing to happen to her. Yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as she can. Because I know the disease that she has is going to erase who she is eventually. And eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give her 24 hour medically trained care. But until then, we can handle it amongst ourselves. It's not that bad. But it's getting worse. She really has no business living by herself anymore. So the solution right now is he stays there most of the time with her. And I go back to our house. And it gets stressful and it gets annoying because I handle the outside things. I run the errands. I take her to the store, things like that. He does the day to day things, make sure she eats, make sure she, you know, has clean clothes, things like that. So, I mean, it's a partnership. It's a dual effort. It's very much a dual effort. But I would like her to move in with us. So that was that's like a source of it's not really like yelling, screaming argument, but lively discussion, you know, and debate. It's not insurmountable. I mean, life's not going to be easy ever. And if it is, it's when you should worry because that's when somebody can pull the rug out from under you. So as long as you're on top of things and you're present in your life, it's not going to be easy. But you deal with it and you move on. The most positive influence, I think, have been probably my mother and my grandmother, because my mom was pretty much a single mom. And my grandmother helped raise me. And they actually gave me a lot of confidence and but were realistic about it. So, I mean, I think I have sort of a realistic sort of a downer temperament to myself. But they helped me see that it's just in me and it's not something I can't get over and that, you know, life's going to go on. You know, my mom would say to me, when you're 40, you're 40, whether you're working at McDonald's or doing what you want with your life. I think that was a big influence on how I've lived my life since she's passed. I regret not taking care of myself in the last year of my mother's life because I think it may have clouded some of my decisions. Now, I do have underlying conditions. Everybody in my family is diabetic, and I didn't take care of that when she was the last year for life because I was too busy wanting to get her home. My focus was to get her home.

That's like one huge regret that I have. Do you think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself? Oh, I know I am. But it's my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine. And I know other people, I can't really direct them into my own vision because they're their own individual beings. And they can't, you know, be what I want them to be. And I know they're not going to be. But I still have, you know, my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to. Fit into my life in a way in the best way possible. But I know because they're other beings. And I'm not going to be able to do that for them. Then I can be able to do that for me. But it's still by ideals. So I sometimes have to look at and go, well, is this what I want? Because I want it or what is what they want and what's there is their decision or mine and it's theirs.

Do things for yourself to keep that sense of yourself. That's probably the advice I would give myself 10 years ago. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, but probably because I haven't gone to a doctor about it because I don't want to know.

At that time, we were married for about two years at that point, and I started getting very distant from him, just pushing everything away, just, you know, figuring out what am I going to do with the rest of my life now? And it's been a fight. And there are times when, no, I couldn't get up. Just stay in bed and sleep all day. You know, but then you realize that when my mother died, I had forecast look after two are mine to rehearse. I mean, well, they don't have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own supplies. I took that responsibility of doing it for them. So that was one motivating factor was that they didn't have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them. I mean, I could go without eating. I could go without taking care of myself, but they couldn't. They didn't, you know, so they actually got me up and. And made me go out and face things, even though I didn't want to, just kind of want to curl up and die. But that would have been my choice, not theirs. And what would happen to them if I wasn't there to take care of them? They would have been, you know, sent to a shelter or whatever, probably. And maybe they would have not been re adopt me home and adopted by somebody else. Maybe they would have been killed for me. I mean, for me making selfish decisions. So it's like I need somebody to take care of to get myself out of bed. And that's actually been a motivating factor is to take because I figured out that it was just me. I'd be able to live without a lot of stuff. I mean, I would be able to live in my car if I wanted. It wouldn't be a big deal. I wouldn't care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life. But I have a family to look after now. So I have to go out and do things. You know, I have to go out and look for legitimate work, you know, day job. I have to, you know, but I'm trying to strike a balance between the two because it's what I want to do with my life. But yet I have to take care of my family. Some work on a balance of the two. Very. But it's worth it. I mean, I'd have a lot less things to worry about if I just lived in my car and said, forget it. But keeping a residence down, paying bills, things like that, it's difficult, but you have to do it. You know, if you want any if you ever want anything in your life, you have to go through that. And I know that. But it gets hard. Sometimes you do want to give up. But then it's like, well, what's the alternative? I mean, I don't think I could live a comfortable life because if I did, I wouldn't do anything. I have to be slightly uncomfortable or I'm not going to do anything with myself. I'm just going to be content. Just hang out all day, stay in bed, hang out with my cats or whatever. And I wouldn't get anything done. I see. How do you even feel? Very anxious and nervous. And I mean, what if. I don't find enough work to be able to pay my rent or whatever. What if? You know, what if I can't. Keep. Assemblance of stability in my life, and it's actually hard work to be stable. And I know it's hard work to be stable, but what you know, it's just a lot of what ifs. And I don't think it's things that haven't happened. And it's stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven't happened. And I know that, but it still creeps in. So that's actually a source of. Anxiety. The internal anxiety go by getting things done, figuring things out, making a solid plan and going for it. But I know it's a cycle and I'll go from being really anxious and oh, my God, what am I going to do? Just saying, OK, what is. The fundamental thing I need to take care of here. I mean, what is just extraneous and what are the actual non issues and what is the actual issue? And so. Figure out how to figure things out that way. And then the anxiety starts to go away a little bit, but then something will pop up and the what ifs will come up again. I'll have to. Figure it out again, but I know it's a cycle. I know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it, you get over it pretty quickly. You get through it. The last time I felt really happy. I don't know. Like. Huh. Good question. But that actually surprisingly stumped me. Because I do feel happy sometimes, sometimes not so much. Sometimes it's kind of in the middle. Really like over joyously happy. I don't know. I have not. I can't think of when that happened. I don't know. You don't know perceptions of other people. I mean. Probably as oddly enough, somebody who is laid back and you know. Handle things as they come, but I don't see myself as that at all. And so it. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Probably that I can think on my feet and I'm not afraid to. Hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to to survive and get things done. That. And I can do it creatively and I try to. Strive for balance. Probably the best things about me. That's great. What are you most proud of in your life? That I'm doing basically what I want with my life, which even though it's not all easy, it's not. I'm not financially well off or anything. It's still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives because I have an aunt that I really don't talk to and the reason why I don't talk to her is because she's always miserable. I mean, she's got a career that she. It's more of a job that she fell into. Because my older aunt loves animals, but didn't want to be a veterinarian, so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it. She had a stable business for a long time. But her, you know, she started getting arthritis in her hands and she had actually my cousin's father went and kind of stole all the money from her business, so she lost her business. And she kind of retired early because between that and the arthritis, she wanted retiring early. She employed my younger aunt, who is still a dog groomer, but she hates it. And it's like change your life. If you hate your life so much, change it. And I think the thing I'm most proud of is. Yeah, I'm not as financially well off as she is, but I'm doing what I want with my life. You know, I can be creative. I can have creative people around me, people who I actually like to talk to around me. People I actually like in my life and be happy with that. And I see a lot of people who aren't. And it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of self satisfaction to be able to say I'm not like that. That I'm actually doing what I want, even though there are sacrifices. I'm still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Thank you.",
         "I’ve had times in my life where I’ve been severely depressed, though I haven’t gone to a doctor for a diagnosis because I’d rather pull myself out of it before resorting to treatment. A major trigger was after my mother died about four years ago. It had been a long battle for a year that we lost, and I didn't know if I was to blame, even though logically I knew I wasn't. My bottom fell out of my world, sending me into a deep depression.\n\nDuring that time, I almost got divorced because I just didn't want anything anymore. I became very distant from my husband, pushing everything away. There were times when I couldn't get up, just wanting to stay in bed and sleep all day, or just curl up and die. I also neglected my own health, not taking care of my diabetes, eating horribly, and not taking my insulin properly for about a year before my mother passed. This led to me developing pulmonary embolisms in both lungs, which was a tough fight to recover from.\n\nCurrently, I feel very anxious and nervous. I worry a lot about \"what ifs,\" like not finding enough work to pay rent or not being able to keep a semblance of stability in my life. It’s hard work to be stable, and I know that, but the anxiety still creeps in. I also can't think of the last time I felt over joyously happy. Sometimes I feel happy, sometimes not so much, sometimes it's in the middle.\n\nTo cope, I've learned that I need someone to take care of to get myself out of bed. My cats were a major motivating factor after my mother died, as they depended on me. Now, I have my family to look after, which makes me go out and do things, even when I want to give up. I try to combat anxiety by getting things done, figuring things out, and making a solid plan. I know it’s a cycle, but I also know that what seems huge on the surface can be chipped away at. I also find that I have to be slightly uncomfortable, or I won't do anything with myself; I'd just be content to hang out all day and stay in bed. My mother and grandmother also instilled in me a sense of confidence and realism, helping me understand that my \"downer temperament\" is just part of me, but life goes on. I also relax by singing, reading, writing, or just trying to clear my mind, though that doesn't always work.",

She's going to chat with me for a bit, and then when she's done she'll let you know and I'll give you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're done. Okay. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Hi, I'm Ellie. I just created a topic in the morning, and it's called, I'm not a dancer, but I'm here to learn about people and I'm glad that I'm here. I like the new fashion and the new fashion. And you can still see me in the video. Can you see me? I'm really comfortable with it. Are you going to be able to see me? Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from? I'm from Los Angeles, California. Really? What do you think you really like about LA? Wow, wonderful weather, outdoor activities all the time. What are you studying over there? Too crowded pollution. The norm. Okay. What do you study at school? I study child communications. Recently I just, I would say yes. Preschool teacher. Well, I've always worked with children ever since I was 18 years old. So I figured doing something helping someone. It doesn't pay well, but you're investing in the future. Wow. Some job that I could get paid to be outside all day. Get paid well to be outside all day. Yes. I'm kind of quiet, but I also like, I probably would say borderline. I like outside activities, but I mainly kind of do activities probably by myself. So yeah, I would say I'm an introvert slightly. Wow. Just maybe a racist or disrespectful person. I kind of shut down and reevaluate how I am as a person, how I'm coming off to other people. I can't change anyone else's personality, but I can work on my own. You're pretty good. I usually argue with people I usually walk away. I mean, an argument doesn't settle anything. Wow. So a lot of things I regret, but it's not anything that I can control. Probably the biggest regret was losing my mother. Thank you. I was extremely close to my mother. That was who I am as a person who made me as a person. Wow. 2010 years ago I would tell myself not to be so angry, so upset all the time about things I can't control. I would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself. Pretty cool. I think you should have different avenues to deal with different people. No, I have not. No, I have not. Yes. I realized I have to evaluate myself as a person, so I can't really look to anyone else to help me unless I start with myself. No, I don't. I feel like as a person, as an individual, I feel like I should be able to control things myself. I feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else. It probably is very good for other people. I've worked with that population of PTSD veterans before, so I know that it helps a lot of people, but I don't feel like it's for me. It's not difficult at all. I've always been alone or someone who tries to handle my own problems and situations. I'm a little depressed, but I think everyone has a little bit of sadness in them at some point. Day by day, day by day, I just started an exercise program, so I'm trying to look at myself for the solution. I've always known, ever since I was a child, things move me differently than other kids, so I felt like I was always different. I felt like if I was going to ever understand me as a person, then I would have to work on myself. Okay. When was the longest time you felt really happy? Today. I got to see my best friend after a long time. I mean, happiness comes and goes, but I felt happy today. That's great. How are your best friends? Wow. He would say really silly, but still, when I'm around him, I try to be happy. I try to present a situation where we're both going to be happy. No one wants to be around a depressed person. Wow. I mean, on certain days, everything could be my best quality, but I would say I'm loyal, I'm dependable. I would just say I try to be there in the moment. I'm not a person who is really flashy or into materialistic things, so I feel like I'm very grounded. Can someone tell me about your mother? Oh, my mother. By far, my sister. Can you tell me about that? My mom was a school teacher, which made me want to become a school teacher, and that's basically what I have been doing. My sister has been at her job for 40 years, so I've always had a stable influence in my life. What is your favorite thing about your mother? Wow. I would say just sitting on a sunny, nice day talking to my mother, I would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately. How do you feel about your mother? Wonderful. Wonderful. What is your favorite thing about your mother? I like to get out and play sports. I play four or five different sports, and I like to go for a walk. I like to ride my bike. I like to get out and be active. What's good? What are you learning from your mother? Having such a wonderful mother. I mean, I have to keep going back to that subject, because we're introduced into this life, and that's our first teacher. That's our first teacher, and it's going to be our teacher for a very long time. I'm just very thankful. I'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother. How did you get so into your mother's life? Riding my bike. Simple things. Going for a walk with my sister, exercising. When was the last time you talked to her? Just last Sunday. That's good. Okay, I think I know what I'm saying. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Well, thank you. Bye. Wow. That was too scary. That was too many glasses.",

         "I'm a little depressed, though I believe everyone experiences some sadness. I'm generally quiet and an introvert, preferring to do activities by myself.

You can let me know when she sends. Okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? I was born in San Bernardino, California. Really? Yes. Where do you live? I'm staying with a sister in North Hollywood. What's it like for you living with them? She makes it as comfortable as possible. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? I love the weather. And the air is so nice. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. I love the weather. And the entertainment. And the public transportation. What are some things you don't really like about LA? It's very difficult to find full-time employment. And some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the South. Because I lived in the South before. And those are the only two things. Do you travel a lot? No, I don't. What did you study at school? I was an English major in college. Are you still working on that? I haven't finished. Yes, I am. What's your dream job? I'd like to be a recording singer. Really? Yes. When did you decide to do that? I've always loved to sing from the time that I was a child. Do you consider yourself an introvert? At times. Can you tell me about that? When I'm alone, I am extremely... I guess I would say... Inter-minded. I have a lot of thoughts and I keep them to myself. So if I'm in that mode, then I don't really interact with people. But I can also interact with people if I change modes. Okay. Okay, listen. What do you do to relax? I've just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago. Cool. When was the last time that happened? Last week on Thursday. No, on Tuesday. What do you do when you're annoyed? Usually I just try to remain quiet and listen to the situation, if it's a person or if it's a situation that I'm dealing with myself that's annoying. I try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better. Come up with alternate plans so I won't be annoyed. How are you able to control your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I may have had an argument a few weeks ago just about timeliness. Meeting on time and showing up on time. It was actually last Monday. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To just be cautious of people's intentions. And to listen really well because people usually tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it. How would your best friend describe you? A good listener. Patient. Fun. Loving. Generous. Depressed sometimes. But generally a good person. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Within a year and a half ago. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? I just knew that I often thought about situations that happened in the past and kind of blamed the situation for my future. Can you verify something? Certain settings. Can you tell me about that? If I see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when I was younger when things happened and changed my future plans. So I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time. Do you still go to therapy now? I do. Is going to therapy helping you? I'd like to believe that it does. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? I don't worry as much. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues relieves me of the tension of holding them inside. So that's how it's helped me. How hard is that? At first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it actually is good because I know that when things are occurring if I'm able to communicate about them with a certain individual it relieves me of the stress of trying to figure out everything alone. And oftentimes by speaking about the issues it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because I'm hearing myself speak of the issue. Are you happy you did that? Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm planning things and if I'm planning things it affects my sleep. I might wake up in the middle of the night. So sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Irritable. Just very irritable. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? I was feeling anxious but now I'm calmer. Today I don't but I have in the past week. I was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so I was becoming anxious. Thank you. Yes. Maybe in October. When my mother first came she came to visit me in October and when she first got here we had a good time. The first couple of days. So I was happy to see her. I hadn't seen her in over a year. I'm proud that I'm able to adjust to different situations. The older I've gotten the more adaptable I am in different environments and different situations. I've learned how to be more resourceful. So I'm proud of that. I'm sorry? My dad, my sister, she's positive because she's finished her master's degree. My mom sometimes. My best friend is very positive because she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it. So that's an inspiration. When someone lies consistently. I listen very very well. Sometimes I give good advice. I'm a good friend. I normally do the things that I say I'm going to do so I'm dependable. I communicate well and I enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods. Being around positive people. Music puts me in a good mood. Comedy shows put me in a good mood. Good food puts me in a good mood. When I graduated from high school. It was a really, I will never forget it. It was a wonderful day. Very confident, accomplished and I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future. You're welcome. Bye. Thank you.",

Generous. Depressed sometimes. But generally a good person. That's good. Have you ever served in the military? No I have not. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Within a year and a half ago. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? I just knew that I often thought about situations that happened in the past and kind of blamed the situation for my future. Certain settings. Can you tell me about that? If I see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when I was younger when things happened and changed my future plans. So I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time. Do you still go to therapy now? I do. Is going to therapy helping you? I'd like to believe that it does. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? I don't worry as much. How has seeing a therapist affected you? It's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues relieves me of the tension of holding them inside. So that's how it's helped me. How hard is that? At first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it actually is good because I know that when things are occurring if I'm able to communicate about them with a certain individual it relieves me of the stress of trying to figure out everything alone. And oftentimes by speaking about the issues it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because I'm hearing myself speak of the issue. Are you happy you did that? Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm planning things and if I'm planning things it affects my sleep. I might wake up in the middle of the night. So sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Irritable. Just very irritable. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? I was feeling anxious but now I'm calmer. Today I don't but I have in the past week. I was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so I was becoming anxious. Thank you. Yes. Maybe in October. When my mother first came she came to visit me in October and when she first got here we had a good time. The first couple of days. So I was happy to see her. I hadn't seen her in over a year. I'm proud that I'm able to adjust to different situations. The older I've gotten the more adaptable I am in different environments and different situations. I've learned how to be more resourceful. So I'm proud of that. I'm sorry? My dad, my sister, she's positive because she's finished her master's degree. My mom sometimes. My best friend is very positive because she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it. So that's an inspiration. When someone lies consistently. I listen very very well. Sometimes I give good advice. I'm a good friend. I normally do the things that I say I'm going to do so I'm dependable. I communicate well and I enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods. Being around positive people. Music puts me in a good mood. Comedy shows put me in a good mood. Good food puts me in a good mood. When I graduated from high school. It was a really, I will never forget it. It was a wonderful day. Very confident, accomplished and I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future. You're welcome. Bye. Thank you.",
         "My best friend sometimes describes me as depressed, and I do experience that sometimes. Lately, I've been feeling anxious, especially in the past week, because I've been trying to find a stable place to live, and it's been taking a long time. When I don't sleep well, which can happen if I'm planning things and wake up in the middle of the night, I become very irritable.\n\nI was diagnosed with PTSD about a year and a half ago. I've often thought about past situations and blamed them for my future, especially when I see certain types of individuals or am in certain settings that remind me of when I was younger and things happened that changed my future plans. Because of this, I used to try to avoid those situations and people.\n\nI still go to therapy, and I believe it helps me. I've noticed I don't worry as much, and it's allowed me to understand that speaking about issues relieves the tension of holding them inside. It was difficult at first to be open about my internal emotions, but now it feels good because I know that communicating helps relieve the stress of trying to figure everything out alone. Often, by speaking about issues, I can come up with better alternative plans just by hearing myself talk.\n\nWhen I'm alone, I can be very 'inter-minded,' having a lot of thoughts that I keep to myself, and in that mode, I don't really interact with people. However, I can also change modes and interact. To relax, I've recently started doing yoga. When I'm annoyed, I usually try to remain quiet, listen, and think of alternate ways or plans to make the situation better. Being around positive people, listening to music, watching comedy shows, and good food also put me in a good mood. I'm proud that I've become more adaptable and resourceful in different environments and situations as I've gotten older.",

         "I'm feeling a bit tired today. A major challenge for me is raising my son with a disability; it's very hard not knowing how to help him. I've also dealt with a lot of frustration, particularly with my mom, who I feel gets too involved and put me down for wanting to socialize. I love her, but it makes me frustrated, and I hate even having those thoughts.\n\nMy sleep schedule is quite early; I go to bed around 8 or 8:30 PM, but then I wake up very early, like 1 or 1:30 AM. I've noticed I can be very moody, irritable, and short-tempered, and a bit more sensitive. I've definitely experienced feelings of guilt, sadness, or depression, especially concerning my son's disability. However, I'm now actively working to deal with these challenges better. I'm finding more avenues and resources to help him, and I'm trying to think more positively, rather than feeling sorry for him or myself, or getting stuck in those guilty, sad, or depressed feelings. When I get frustrated, I sometimes go for a walk or try not to think about it. The last time I felt truly happy was a few weeks ago after I did well in school, which was a big achievement for me after a long time.",

She's going to chat with you for a bit, and then when she's done, she'll say goodbye, and I will put the doorbell over here so you can let me know when you're done, okay? Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions from the start. And please feel free to tell me everything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Born downtown Los Angeles. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I love LA. I love the traffic on the 405. I love the beach. I live near the beach. I love...there's so much to do here. I just love...and I love the weather. I love it here. That's great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Nothing. Okay. Do you travel a lot? A little bit. What do you enjoy about traveling? I guess visiting family and destinations. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I last flew to Cedar Rapids to visit a friend, and was there for a couple weeks, and I'm flying back February 11th to see him again. He's an old friend. Thanks. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No. Why? I'm pretty outgoing. I talk to people. I enjoy talking to people. I talk to people at the airport. What do you do to relax? I garden a little bit. I read a little bit. I watch TV. I'm a basketball fan. I go to the beach when the weather is nice. I go to the pool. Okay. What are some things that make you a little mad? Annoying people, rude people, people that drive. They just have no consideration for others. What do you do when you're annoyed? I swear a lot. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, I'm all right. I get mad once in a while. When was the last time you argued with someone? It was probably my daughter. She's 21, almost 22. She lives at college, but comes home on the weekends, and her room was probably a mess. It's the same fight we've been having for years. Uh-oh. That's not good. Yeah, it does. It's better now that we don't live together all the time, though. That's good. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? I guess making the right decisions. It started out when she was little about education, the right school to go to, the right activities to do, setting a good example, being a good role model. What's the best thing about being a parent? Oh, everything. My kids are the greatest joy of my life. I love them so much. And you just get so enriched and fulfilled by them. And when the kids are little, you see things through their eyes, which is exciting. You want to share everything with them. That's so good to hear. Tell me about your kids. I have an older son who's a financial analyst, and then I have a daughter in college. She's a liberal studies major. She's going to be a teacher. Cool. What did you study at school? A business. Are you still working at that? Yes. What do you do now? I'm an office manager. What's your dream job? My dream job? Wow, that's hard. I don't know. I like my job. It's good. I like the people. I enjoy it. It's fun. Good. What do you think of the names of the kids? My son told me they're called the teacup generation because they're fragile. And I think their pain's in the ass, as most of them. Yeah. I see what you mean. Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Not for a while. Maybe a month ago. Can you tell me about that? I have a new boyfriend, and things were going really great, and now they're just going. It was great, and now it's just okay. I guess the newness wore off. How hard is that? It's hard. It's hard. How do you know them? I'm sorry? How do you know them? How do I know them? I don't know what you mean by them. Let's come back to that later. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I don't know. A year or so. What got you to this point? I just didn't feel well. I just couldn't. I just didn't feel right. I couldn't pull myself out of it. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? Oh, just sad and just lack of energy and didn't really, wasn't really motivated, didn't really, wasn't really my happy self. Do you feel like there's a useful? Therapy? Yes. Do you still get a therapy now? I do. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? Well, not that many changes. I still don't feel that great, but I just, it's good to talk to someone and tell them how you feel. Yeah. Even if it's just to get something off your chest. How have you been feeling lately? Tired, sad, depressed, blue. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I'm just not happy. I don't feel good and I'm not happy. How do you cope with that? I don't just stay to myself, don't go out with friends as much as I used to. That sounds really hard. It's very hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Terrible. I don't sleep. I'm sorry. Thank you. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Crazy, distracted. It's hard for me to cope with things. Easy, mundane things are just difficult. I see what you mean. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Well, being around my kids is fun. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? My son and daughter-in-law and my daughter and I went out to have Hawaiian food. We got together. It's always fun to get together. We got together at my house on Christmas. I enjoyed just getting together with them. Awesome. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'll take better care of my health, I guess. Have you done anything to avoid it? I don't know. I don't know. Okay. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my daughter's pretty positive and upbeat. My parents, they're both gone, but they were pretty positive. What's on your mind when you're most memorable experience? I suppose going on a trip to Canada with my daughter was very memorable. Can you tell me about that? We flew to Detroit, where I have my best friend lives there. We stayed with her. We drove from Detroit through Canada, Niagara Falls. We went to Buffalo, where she's from. She has three girls. My daughter was, I think, third or fourth grade, something like that. It was just fun for all of us to get together and do things. That sounds like a great situation. What would your best friend describe you? Exactly like her. We're outgoing. We're outspoken. We tell it like it is. We're high-energy people. We have a lot of anxiety. We like to do a lot of the same things. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. About three or four weeks ago. Tell me more about that. Well, I say that my feeling is attributed to weather. I don't like cold weather, and I'm not comfortable at all in it. Whenever the weather changes, I sort of get down. What would you say if somebody asked about you? Well, I'm funny. I'm hardworking. I care about everyone. I'm a very kind, compassionate person. I have sympathy for everyone. I'll reach out to someone that I see in a store or anywhere that needs my help. That's good. What are you most proud of in your life? I suppose raising my kids and the good people they've turned out to be. That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye.",

I live near the beach. I love...there's so much to do here. And I love the weather. I love it here. That's great. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Nothing. Okay. Do you travel a lot? A little bit. What do you enjoy about traveling? I guess visiting family and destinations. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I last flew to Cedar Rapids to visit a friend, and was there for a couple weeks, and I'm flying back February 11th to see him again. He's an old friend. Thanks. Do you consider yourself an introvert? No. Why? I'm pretty outgoing. I talk to people. I enjoy talking to people. I talk to people at the airport. What do you do to relax? I garden a little bit. I read a little bit. I watch TV. I'm a basketball fan. I go to the beach when the weather is nice. I go to the pool. Okay. What are some things that make you a little mad? Annoying people, rude people, people that drive. They just have no consideration for others. What do you do when you're annoyed? I swear a lot. How are you at controlling your temper? Oh, I'm all right. I get mad once in a while. When was the last time you argued with someone? It was probably my daughter. She's 21, almost 22. She lives at college, but comes home on the weekends, and her room was probably a mess. It's the same fight we've been having for years. Uh-oh. That's not good. Yeah, it does. It's better now that we don't live together all the time, though. That's good. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? I guess making the right decisions. It started out when she was little about education, the right school to go to, the right activities to do, setting a good example, being a good role model. What's the best thing about being a parent? Oh, everything. My kids are the greatest joy of my life. I love them so much. And you just get so enriched and fulfilled by them. And when the kids are little, you see things through their eyes, which is exciting. You want to share everything with them. That's so good to hear. Tell me about your kids. I have an older son who's a financial analyst, and then I have a daughter in college. She's a liberal studies major. She's going to be a teacher. Cool. What did you study at school? A business. Are you still working at that? Yes. What do you do now? I'm an office manager. What's your dream job? My dream job? Wow, that's hard. I don't know. I like my job. It's good. I like the people. I enjoy it. It's fun. Good. What do you think of the names of the kids? My son told me they're called the teacup generation because they're fragile. And I think their pain's in the ass, as most of them. Yeah. I see what you mean. Yeah. When was the last time you felt really happy? Not for a while. Maybe a month ago. Can you tell me about that? I have a new boyfriend, and things were going really great, and now it's just okay. I guess the newness wore off. How hard is that? It's hard. How do you know them? I'm sorry? How do you know them? How do I know them? I don't know what you mean by them. Let's come back to that later. Okay. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I don't know. A year or so. What got you to this point? I just didn't feel well. I just didn't feel right. I couldn't pull myself out of it. Did you think you had a problem before you found out? Yeah. What were your symptoms? Oh, just sad and just lack of energy and wasn't really motivated, wasn't really my happy self. Therapy? Yes. Do you still get a therapy now? I do. What sort of changes have you noticed since you've been on the therapy? Well, not that many changes. I still don't feel that great, but it's good to talk to someone and tell them how you feel. Yeah. Even if it's just to get something off your chest. How have you been feeling lately? Tired, sad, depressed, blue. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, I'm just not happy. I don't feel good. How do you cope with that? I don't just stay to myself, don't go out with friends as much as I used to. That sounds really hard. It's very hard. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Terrible. I don't sleep. I'm sorry. Thank you. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Crazy, distracted. It's hard for me to cope with things. Easy, mundane things are just difficult. I see what you mean. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Well, being around my kids is fun. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? My son and daughter-in-law and my daughter and I went out to have Hawaiian food. We got together. It's always fun to get together. We got together at my house on Christmas. I enjoyed just getting together with them. Awesome. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'll take better care of my health, I guess. Have you done anything to avoid it? I don't know. Okay. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my daughter's pretty positive and upbeat. My parents, they're both gone, but they were pretty positive. What's on your mind when you're most memorable experience? I suppose going on a trip to Canada with my daughter was very memorable. Can you tell me about that? We flew to Detroit, where I have my best friend lives there. We stayed with her. We drove from Detroit through Canada, Niagara Falls. We went to Buffalo, where she's from. She has three girls. My daughter was, I think, third or fourth grade, something like that. It was just fun for all of us to get together and do things. That sounds like a great situation. What would your best friend describe you? Exactly like her. We're outgoing. We're outspoken. We tell it like it is. We're high-energy people. We have a lot of anxiety. We like to do a lot of the same things. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I don't know. About three or four weeks ago. Tell me more about that. Well, I say that my feeling is attributed to weather. I don't like cold weather, and I'm not comfortable at all in it. Whenever the weather changes, I sort of get down. What would you say if somebody asked about you? Well, I'm funny. I'm hardworking. I care about everyone. I'm a very kind, compassionate person. I have sympathy for everyone. I'll reach out to someone that I see in a store or anywhere that needs my help. That's good. What are you most proud of in your life? I suppose raising my kids and the good people they've turned out to be. That's great. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye.",

I think I've been there twice in the past year. That's good. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm more of a creature of habit. Okay. You consider yourself a creature of habit? Yes. Why? Sometimes I feel like I don't fit into the crowd. It's better sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of going in and actively pursue things. What do you do to relax? Probably listen to music and spend time with my dogs. What are some things that you do to relax? Probably people being not very nice to me or seeing injustices. I think that's about it. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone? Probably a couple of days ago. One of my friends was saying that they were making a comment about how I am and I got kind of upset about that. Does that happen now? Yeah, it does. How close are you to them? Pretty close. How do you know them? They're my best friend. I'm just one of my friends. What do you do when you're annoyed? I kind of am quiet about it. When a person pushes me to a certain point, that's when I overreact usually. How hard is that? It's pretty hard. I'd rather the person notice that I'm getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting to the point where it blows out of proportion. What's one thing that's memorable for you? Probably spending time with my family in New York. How close are you to your family? That's good. Who's someone that's been a positive influence on you? Tell me more about that. I don't know, they're just great people. I love them a lot. They're a lot like me, so I feel like I have people that understand me. That's good. Tell me your best time describing them. Probably loyal, sensitive. I don't know, it's kind of hard. It's a hard question. Have you ever sort of been military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? Gosh, I think probably 1997, so a long time ago. What got you to see the health? During that time I was just going through a lot of issues and I was feeling unsafe to myself, so I ended up going to the doctor to kind of get meds and have therapy and stuff. Do you still go to therapy now? Not currently. I ended about like six months ago. Why did you stop? I just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me. I felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over, and she wasn't really challenging me. I've been in therapy for a really long time, so I just knew it was a change. Sorry to hear that. It's okay. Do you feel like there's a usefulness? Yes, I do actually. When I feel connected to a therapist, I feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what I'm going through. What sort of changes have been made since you've been in therapy? I'm better at describing my emotions and feelings. I think the biggest thing is when I'm in situations, I can see myself reacting one way, and I take a step back and see how I can react normally almost in a way. Also, I tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel really bad about myself. It's nice to talk to someone that's not judging, that doesn't really tell me it's okay basically. What were your symptoms? Feeling hopeless all the time, not having enough energy to do things I used to like, I had a little bit of concentration issues, having weird, disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind, and overall just feeling kind of crummy about life. Are they triggered by something? Sometimes they are, like random moments, if there's a problem with my interpersonal life or something like that, or if I sometimes even seeing something on television, sometimes that affects me. How do you tell people? Listening to music or trying to distract myself, trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things. How can you tell people you're related? It's been a tough transition to come here, well, being here, so kind of half and half okay and not okay. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? I feel like I've been a little bit more withdrawn lately, but that's about it. Okay, how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Some days it's great, some days it's not. More recently it's been a little bit more difficult. Why? I don't know why, I have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night, so I tend not to sleep very well, and I wake up quite frequently during the night. Why do you like to be down sleep well? I'm very groggy in the morning and that's about it. Like during the day I tend to yawn a lot, and my friends always are like, why are you yawning so much, are you just as interested in what we're doing? And I'm trying to tell them it's not that at all. Okay, when was the last time you had a good night's sleep? Probably Christmas time when I was with my family. How did you feel about your family? Just really happy and feeling like everything was alright in my life. Having a good sense of where I was at that moment, being present with myself. That's good. What would you say are some of the best qualities? Probably, you know, let's see, that's a hard question. I think probably I can tend to read people kind of well sometimes, and I like to say that I'm good at being a good friend to people, being a good family member. I'm a hard worker when I do have a job. Do you have any regrets? Sure, I mean it's life so of course there's regrets. One that comes to mind is I wish that I don't eat as much so I can be a lot more healthy. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Don't take things so seriously. Enjoy being youthful and I think that's it. Okay. What are you most proud of in your life? I don't know. That's a good question. Probably my previous job and my employment I worked really well with kids. So I did a great job at that. I was a researcher at a hospital and I helped a lot of kids out for about six years, so seven years. Wow, that's interesting. Yeah, it was awesome. How did you decide to do that? I was really inclined to like reading people and so I decided to major in psychology. Then I went and worked in a mental health facility and did research with them with drugs and depression and things like that. It found a good niche for me. That's great. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. No problem. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hi. Take a moment to announce that I have stopped recording. Okay. Okay.",

         "I was diagnosed with depression a long time ago, back in 1997. I sought help because I was going through a lot of issues and felt unsafe to myself, which led me to get medication and therapy. I'm not currently in therapy; I stopped about six months ago because I felt my therapist wasn't really challenging me and we kept discussing the same things. However, I do find therapy useful when I connect with a therapist, as it helps me talk about what I'm going through. Through therapy, I've become better at describing my emotions and feelings, and I can now take a step back in situations to react more normally. I also used to bury my emotions and feel bad about myself, so it was helpful to talk to someone non-judgmental.\n\nMy symptoms have included feeling hopeless all the time, not having enough energy for things I used to enjoy, and having some concentration issues. I also experience weird, disturbing thoughts that sometimes pop into my mind, and an overall crummy feeling about life. These feelings can be triggered by random moments, problems in my interpersonal life, or even by seeing something on television.\n\nTo cope, I listen to music, try to distract myself, and my therapist encouraged me to journal. Lately, I've noticed I've been a bit more withdrawn. My sleep has also been more difficult recently; I have a lot of thoughts at night, so I don't sleep well and wake up frequently. This leaves me groggy and yawning a lot during the day, which my friends sometimes mistake for disinterest. The last time I had a truly good night's sleep was around Christmas when I was with my family in New York, which made me feel really happy and present. Moving to LA a year ago was also pretty difficult, and the transition has left me feeling \"half and half okay and not okay.\"",

I love being near the ocean and the palm trees and mountains. I just love it here. It's pretty easy. There's a few differences. It's a huge city compared to where I'm from, so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me. I just always wanted to live in California. I hated being landlocked in Oklahoma and just wanted to get out to the west coast, be near the ocean. I studied psychology and minored in art. No, not at the moment. Well, actually, I think I misunderstood your question. I'm not still working on my degree, but I am working in the field of psychology. I just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law. My dream job? Oh, I don't really know. I just want to help people however I can. I just like working with people in the realm of psychology, so I think I may already have my dream job. What do you do for a living? To relax. I like to read or watch movies. I like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends. What are the things that make you really mad? The things that make me really mad? Probably injustice towards other people, people being mistreated or abused, and people being lied to and deceived. Including myself, I hate being lied to. What do you do when you're mad? When I'm annoyed, it depends on the situation, but I try to just count to ten and take a deep breath and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way, so I just try and calm down before I say anything. How do you deal with anger? It depends again on the situation and who I'm angry with. Most of the time I'm pretty good at controlling it, but sometimes I think like most people I'll lash out at the people that I'm closest to at times, and those moments I'm not that good at controlling it. When was the last time you argued with someone? When was the last time I argued with someone? It was probably with my parents. I've been having some car trouble lately, and I'm also running low on money, so I don't even remember exactly, but I'm sure we probably thought about the fact that I need to be more self-sufficient and independent and take care of my own things like car issues.

         " Let me see. I think from this distance I think I better. Yes. Okay. From here from Alhambra. The weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. What are some things you don't really like about the weather? Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? Is that amazing? How did you decide to do that? Are you still working on that? Yes. What are you doing now? I'm a photographer. Nice. What's your dream job? Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. Okay. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. I see. How do you like your living situation? It's fair. It's not the greatest. Because of being an apartment manager, I do have free rent, but I have to stay there a lot. That's tough. That part does. The free rent part is very good. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Oh gosh. My most memorable experience. That's hard to say. Well, I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. What else do you like? Oh, well I guess some sports success when I was in high school. There were a few things that I was happy about. And some art pieces I've made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death. Those are very memorable and not good though. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters. So my family. How close are you to your family? We're fairly close. Most of them live around in LA. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. Wow. When do you think of the music? Mostly very talented. Just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. Seems like they were all hooked into social media. What do you do to relax? I go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. And I... Well, there's some kind of injustices that happen. Not big deals, but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend. And when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it. And we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set up time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up. When they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that part is upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up at the office. They just need to please the school to maintain the account. So often when that something like that happens, it means they will not send you out to work at that school again, which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. That's how they do things. So that is upsetting. How do you cope with that? Most of the time I dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that might be better. That's good. Yeah. How are you at controlling your company? Pretty good. I usually might, in the moment I don't really lose it, but later I might vent or something like that. But on the location I wouldn't do that. When was the last time you argued with someone? Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. I have a friend that I'm sharing the car with today. We were arguing on where to go first. So we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And then after this was one of the things is over, then we're going to do some more of her things. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Is that what that is? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I'd say 1980. Yeah, I believe it was 1980. What got you to see the doctor? My father noticed some symptoms. My father passed away, but he was a psychiatrist. What were your symptoms? Well, I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon. And I didn't have a focus like for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all part of depression. Yeah. Isn't it that you had a problem before you found out? Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? Well, I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done. But I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. What sort of changes have you noticed since you came on the field? I think therapy makes you see what the... I thought of it as a filter or wearing a... As if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really... You see everything through that. So you have to... I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately? Or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. How have you been doing lately? I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I've noticed in my past. Right now we have a work slowdown. So it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule is too wide open. For me personally as a depressed person, I think that structure is really important. It gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere on time and interact with people. Those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed. I think I've noticed any changes in your behavior. Well, I don't know if it changes a little bit. I tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting let's say. But it's more negative. I have been thinking about how soldiers in the past, I don't know why, but during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks, how it would have been like to be in a front line battle with crude weapons and no medical help. I don't know. My mind seems to go there a lot where I'm just thinking about that. I've been looking at and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube and things like that. Or some other kind of like terrible doom type things like I was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that. Where I probably shouldn't dwell so much on that. Oh, you mean life in general? Yeah. Well, I think I regret not finishing college. I think I was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well. I didn't get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years. So that's a big regret that I have. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I think it would have been to, at certain points, I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals, just the logistics. I was an art major and I had no car. So a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and also to meet at away locations. I think it probably would have been worth it to do whatever it took to get a car at that time. What would you say as somebody who has holidays? Well, I've been told I'm very patient and also I have some original artistic ideas. So those are good qualities. I'm very loyal and also I support my friends. I'm fairly generous with them. Tell me about something you really enjoyed. Let's see. Let's see, I really enjoyed it. I had a nice experience just photographing a soccer game recently. I really enjoyed that. I love listening to you talk. Okay, I think I've answered everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. It's my pleasure. Thank you, goodbye. Yeah, that was very interesting. So I'm going to go to the top and then if you want to go back to the other computer.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nLet me see. I think from this distance I think I better. Yes. Okay. From here from Alhambra. The weather is really nice and everything is very familiar. Yeah. I see what you mean. Are you still working on that? Yes. What are you doing now? I'm a photographer. Nice. What's your dream job? Oh, I suppose running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business. Okay. Do you travel a lot? No. I'm also an apartment manager. It keeps me tied down. I see. How do you like your living situation? It's fair. It's not the greatest. Because of being an apartment manager, I do have free rent, but I have to stay there a lot. That's tough. That part does. The free rent part is very good. What's one of your most memorable experiences? Oh gosh. My most memorable experience. That's hard to say. Well, I mean there's good and bad memorable experiences. What else do you like? Oh, well I guess some sports success when I was in high school. There were a few things that I was happy about. And some art pieces I've made were memorable. And some bad things would be my father's death. Those are very memorable and not good though. There's someone that's been a positive influence on your life. Well, my parents and I have a lot of brothers and sisters. So my family. How close are you to your family? We're fairly close. Most of them live around in LA. There's a few that are from distant. My brother lives in New York and my other brother lives in Maui. Wow. Mostly very talented. Just more involved in technology than maybe I was or am. And they're more of a hive mind than when I grew up. Seems like they were all hooked into social media. What do you do to relax? I go on a walk or watch television or play with my computer. And I... Well, there's some kind of injustices that happen. Not big deals, but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking. That's kind of upsetting. And the city doesn't seem to want to make any exceptions or change some rules. And also some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I worked at a high school dance this last weekend. And when we arrived at the site, the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it. And we had to go outside. And then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside. It delayed our set up time. And that wouldn't have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up. When they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint. So that part is upsetting. And our work doesn't back us up at the office. They just need to please the school to maintain the account. So often when something like that happens, it means they will not send you out to work at that school again, which would translate into less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job. That's how they do things. So that is upsetting. How do you cope with that? Most of the time I dust off my resume and start looking for other situations that might be better. That's good. Yeah. How are you at controlling your company? Pretty good. I usually, in the moment I don't really lose it, but later I might vent or something like that. But on the location I wouldn't do that. When was the last time you argued with someone? Well, just today. We have a tight schedule today. I have a friend that I'm sharing the car with today. We were arguing on where to go first. So we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things. And then after this was one of the things is over, then we're going to do some more of her things. Have you ever served in the military? No. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome. Is that what that is? No, I have not. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. How long ago were you diagnosed? I'd say 1980. Yeah, I believe it was 1980. What got you to see the doctor? My father noticed some symptoms. My father passed away, but he was a psychiatrist. What were your symptoms? Well, I wasn't sleeping. I was laying around the house. I was waking up at noon. And I didn't have a focus like for getting a job. It wasn't clear enough. I remember some job interviews that I'd go to their front door and then I wouldn't go in. And I think that was all part of depression. Yeah. Isn't it that you had a problem before you found out? Yeah, I thought I had a problem, but I didn't know what it was. Do you still go to therapy now? No. Why did you stop? Well, I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that he thought that I was done. But I did get to a much better place. I have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression. So I think I'll have good days and bad days. What sort of changes have you noticed since you came on the field? I think therapy makes you see what the... I thought of it as a filter or as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses. You don't really... You see everything through that. So you have to... I have to sort of try to take those glasses off for a little bit and double check. Am I really perceiving these things accurately? Or am I seeing it through a depressed viewpoint? And I try to look for clues about that. How have you been doing lately? I think I'm slipping back a little bit. I don't do well during unemployed periods. I've noticed in my past.

         "I was diagnosed with depression around 1980, after my father, who was a psychiatrist, noticed my symptoms.

There's been 58. Oh, okay. Each study search has like a different number, like 200 and like 200. Oh, okay. All right, well there she is. And I will put the word on that for you. Okay, cool. Thanks.

I'm not aware of us, but I'm here to learn about people and without knowing about you, I'll ask you a few questions about stuff. And please feel free to send me anything. Your answers are free and convenient. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? Fine. Where are you from in the city? Tampa, Florida. Why did you move to LA? That's a point I wanted to get into the entertainment industry. When did you move to LA? 1990. How easy was it for you to get used to it in the morning? It took a long time to get used to it. It wasn't easy. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather and if you have a hobby, you could always find a large group of people that are interested in the same hobbies you have. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Oh, some of the people in the business world, it's pretty transient. They come and go and it's kind of difficult as far as if you, trusting people in the business world has been difficult. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not much at all. How does it compare to LA? It's quite different. The weather's different, the people are different. It's very different. Are you traveling a lot? No. What did you study at school? God, it was so long ago. School, just general stuff, business, acting, that kind of thing. What are you doing now? Well, I'm working on becoming a professional poker player and I left the stock brokerage industry successfully to do financial trading, stock options, futures, that kind of stuff. Do you consider yourself a member? Sometimes, yes. What are some things that you're doing? People, my family, just people making fun of me or just instigators, just being around negative, hostile people. What do you do when you're in orbit? I vent, ruminate over the same situation over and over again. How are you at confirming your own opinion? Pretty darn good. When was the last time you argued with someone and not with your own? Can't remember. Argued with someone. I can't really remember. That's a good sign. I don't argue much these days. Maybe online? Not really, I don't know. What's a good change? I don't know. What did I argue with somebody about? Maybe, it's been a long time. I can't really remember. Oh, I'd say Tony Robbins. Anthony Robbins. Listen to music, surf the internet, study poker, research on stocks. Watch YouTube clips. More towards my sisters, not my parents. I'm not close at all with my parents. Been estranged. No. Not officially, but some people, say I do have the symptoms of it when I've been talking about depression. Yes. I was diagnosed in the early 1990s with dysthymia, which is a mild form of depression, I think, or a long-term lasting mild depression. What thought you as being healthy? A friend had thought he had a learning disability called attention deficit disorder. At that time it was ADHD, so when I looked at the literature, it seemed similar to the symptoms that I had, so then I went to go through the same battery of tests that he did at UCLA. He still doesn't care for you now? No. Why did he stop? It's more of a financial thing. Do you feel like there's a difference? Yes. How do you feel about it? Irritable, moody, tired. Have you ever studied to use another way to get rid of the symptoms? Yes. How easy is it for you to get rid of them? Not easy. What are you like when you're not feeling well? Airheaded, spacey, slow. How do you cope with that? How do I do what? How do you cope with that? Cope with what? How do I? Just come back to that later. Okay. When was the last time you felt really happy? I can't remember. Tell me about something you would never do to me that you really wouldn't do. Play poker online. When was the last time you where that for? In Teacher's Birthday. Yes. Yes? Wow, that's a good question. 10 or 20 years ago, it would have said to stay away from losers, avoid negative people. Don't try to change them, don't try to give them advice, don't try to help them out, don't try to show them the right way. It's just a waste of your energy, my energy. Don't do business with unethical people. New York City wise guys, New York City type wise guys, chronic liars, BSers, and uh... what does it say? Kept my room in better order, dated more women, dated more women, cleaned my room, do a better job of you know, enjoying my nice apartment and my single bachelorhood. Probably surviving my difficult childhood, my dysfunctional family, staying out of trouble, staying away from drugs, illegal drugs, making a name for myself as a good stock trader, good stock picker, and sort of my wisdom I've been able to pass on about eastern philosophy.

You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, being in LA also, you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But you know, you live with that. I see. What did you study at school? I was a business administration major, so I studied business. And after I finished college, I pursued a career in retail operations. Are you still doing that? No. As a matter of fact, I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years. So I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. What made you decide to do that? A couple of factors. After working numerous years in the retail business, I switched over and worked in a creative business, which was a graphic design firm. And I captured a lot of knowledge in the human resources side because I was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a small company. Are you happy you did that? Yes, I'm very happy I did that. I picked up a lot of knowledge and it's very helpful. That's great. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? Well, my dream job is I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am an independent contractor. I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs. And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle. But I also enjoy what I do. I'm not under as much stress as I used to be. That sounds like a great decision. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm not totally outgoing, but I'm not extremely shy. I'm probably right in the middle, maybe more towards outgoing, but I'm not totally outgoing. When I'm around other people, I am in a social situation. I guess you could consider me an outgoing person, but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself. Can you tell me about that? Oh, sure. A couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had bypass operation. It had to do with stress and things like that. I don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me. If I meet someone new, I don't just openly say, well, I've experienced this, this, and this. If it comes up, I won't deny it. If it comes up and I feel like it's something to talk about, I will talk about it. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Actually, my relaxation is I'm currently living with my mom, my mother. She's a senior citizen. She's alone. What I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work, take care of all the gardening and things like that. That's actually very therapeutic. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm not a short-fused kind of person. It takes a lot to get me really angry. As far as my temper is concerned, there's not much to that. When was the last time you argued with someone and what were you about? I'm trying to think here. I can't recall when the last time it was, but it was probably last year sometime when I had a creditor that I was dealing with being very difficult to work with. I owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago. They weren't very understanding of the situation. I really got a little upset about that because I felt like I was being honest with them and I was more than willing to take care of my issues, but they were playing hardball and I didn't care for that. That sucks. It does. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Probably the hardest decision I ever had to make was it had to do with a life and death situation with my stepfather who was battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him, there was a slight chance it was going to help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point, or it would kill him. That was really tough. It was a really tough decision to make. I felt like if I didn't try and see if we could help save his life or if we didn't take a chance and take that extra step, that I would regret it in the long run. That's really hard. It is. It was. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Right now I'm separated from my wife. She has her issues, I have my issues, but we are not divorced. We are just separated. We still have a relationship where we still speak to each other. We just don't live together. The relationship with my mother is really great. She's very understanding. I'm an only child, so she likes having me around, which is good because she's in her later stage of her life. She's 82 years old. I guess it's good that in its own way, maybe fate has taken place because someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing, but with me there, I think there's a comfort level she feels with me there, especially being her only child. What's something you feel guilty about? Probably the most guilty I feel about anything are the things that I did to hurt my marriage. As far as the things that I did, the selfish things that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife. Can you give me an example of that? Yeah. I got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress. My wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had, and we were growing apart. When she was away, my form of release was to go to the casinos and gamble. I spent a lot of time in the casinos, and what eventually happened was I spent a lot of money. Obviously, that was a major issue regarding our relationship. It had to do with trust because it was devastating to my wife. How did you feel at that moment? When it came to light, I felt very guilty, and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life. I'm sorry. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, not at all. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No, not really. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't have problems sleeping. I don't ever recall having any problems sleeping, so no. That's good. Do you feel down? No, not at all. Have you ever spent a change in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. The only thing I can say is that after I had my heart attack a few years ago, I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before. I tend to be a little bit more easygoing, and my friends and family have noticed that. That's great. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. The last time I felt really happy? Probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack. He basically said to me that after many tests and many months of rehabilitation, that he was happy to explain to me that there was no major scar tissue that had occurred because of my heart attack, and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watched my diet and took my medications. That's so good to hear. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, I guess the number one thing is my physical being itself. I like to be a little bit more healthier, lose some more weight, just in general be more healthier physically. As far as mentally, just not go back to those ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things, and not to be so selfish. How do you cope with that? Just one day at a time. I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis. I meditate, I read some books, I watch TV. I do things that I know that if I can help myself, I do things to help myself. Is there anything you regret? There's a lot that I regret, obviously. My marriage, my working career as far as I had a long career with this major's food chain. Basically because of my gambling issues, I ended up ruining a very good career. At this point right now, there's not much I can do. I can't change what's been done, so I don't focus too much on the past. I just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me every day. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? What advice? Wake up and see what you're doing to yourself and make the changes that need to be changed. I'm not someone that's not intelligent, but I was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong. What you're doing is wrong. You need to change your behavior immediately. What are you most proud of in your life? Probably what I'm proud about overall is the fact that I did all these awful things, but deep down I don't think as a person I'm a bad person. I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior, it was because I had an illness, a compulsive, obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill. I was a sick person just trying to become healthy. Every day that's what my life is about. It's about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night, one day at a time. How hard is that? It's not as hard as you think, but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what's not right for you. It could be okay for other people to do certain things, but I cannot do those things anymore. How are your best friends around you? Most of my best friends describe me as probably easygoing, generous, a nice person to be around. They were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the breakup of my marriage, which it's still not over yet. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning, like around six o'clock. I go to a local park and it's about, this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill. It's about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning. I get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going. Then after that I go home, work in the yard a few hours, take a shower and relax, and then just kick back for the rest of the day. Then the next day I do the same thing again. In the morning I go for a walk, work out in the yard, watch TV, whatever, just relax. That's how a weekend goes for me. Nice. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Lock yourself out. Okay. It's kind of, I actually got comfortable talking to you. Good. If that's the way the future is going to be, like if you're going to talk to a therapist, that's pretty cool.",
         "Okay, great. So everything's all set up now. Okay. So I'm going to pull her up, and then again she's going to ask you some questions, and then she'll let you know when she's finished. Okay. Sorry about that. No, it's okay. So if you just want to give me one second, I'll be right back. Okay. I'm so sorry. That's okay. Use your hair. We have this much technology going on. Yeah. Something's bound to happen, right? Of course. Let's start this again. It doesn't seem to be working. So that's all right. So we'll just keep going. So I'm going to do something for our purposes. Okay. And I'm going to put the... It's kind of spooky. All right. So whenever she's done, she'll let you know, and then you can press this button. Okay. Hi. I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I'm just created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Good. How are you? I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I am from Los Angeles. Really? Yes. What are some things you really like about LA? It's the center of everything. You can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far. I like being in the city. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Well, being in LA also, you're dealing with traffic, a lot of congestion, and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great. But you know, you live with that. I see. What did you study at school? I was a business administration major, so I studied business. And after I finished college, I pursued a career in retail operations. Are you still doing that? No. As a matter of fact, I am not. I kind of changed career over the last four or five years. So I'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business. What made you decide to do that?

Well, my dream job is I'm basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am an independent contractor. I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs. And I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I need to do the things I want to do. And obviously I worked hard early part of my career, so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place. So I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle.

         "I've been told I don't have depression, and I don't feel 'down,' nor do I have trouble sleeping. However, I've experienced deep guilt and felt 'less than a human being' because of past selfish actions, particularly those that hurt my marriage. I also carry regret about how my gambling issues ruined my career and affected my marriage. I recognize my past behaviors as 'wrong' and 'selfish,' but deep down, I don't think I'm a bad person; I see my compulsive gambling as an 'illness' or 'obsessive compulsive behavior' I was trying to become healthy from.\n\nMy compulsive gambling, which I used as a form of release from tremendous work stress, led to significant financial issues and was devastating to my wife, ultimately leading to our separation. It also ruined a good career. Despite these challenges, I maintain a structured daily life, including living with and helping my mother, which I find very therapeutic. Since my heart attack a few years ago, I've become more easygoing, not letting small things bother me as much.\n\nMy primary struggle was compulsive gambling, which I now understand was an 'illness' or 'obsessive compulsive behavior.' To cope, I live 'one day at a time,' focusing on being at peace with myself and having peace of mind daily. My strategies include meditation, reading, and watching TV. I'm diligent about my behavior and routines, knowing what's not right for me and avoiding those things. I try not to focus on the past, instead concentrating on the present and my ongoing recovery. My gambling issues emerged during a period of high work stress for both my wife and me, causing us to grow apart. My friends were shocked when they learned about my issues. I'm currently living with my 82-year-old mother, which provides comfort for her and is therapeutic for me. My recovery from compulsive behavior is an ongoing daily process.",

         " therapy like this instead of with a live human, it'll put all the MFTs out of business. I think it's good sometimes. I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to, if it's someone that might just go by their questions, might judge you or form opinions. If it's a virtual human being, it might be a little less biased also. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly. All right, so I'm going to start up all the recording and then I'm going to actually... I'm trying to slide on some pictures. Sorry, that's in there. Now she is... So now she's going to have a conversation with you. She's going to ask you some questions. When she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to leave you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're all finished. Thank you very much. How do I know... Is she going to say end of session or... Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. Not at all. Sorry about that. I am. I feel pretty good. I'm wide awake. I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee. And I have an easy day today. So I am just going to chat with you. Then I'm going to the gym and run some errands. So I plan on having a nice day today. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here. And I went to school away. But I'm one of the few natives that are actually in Los Angeles. Yes, I am. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. Having owned a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida. I love the weather here. I like the culture. I like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away, one can go to the desert, say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours away, you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's a great place to live. Thank you. Yeah. Well, maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also the regulations, I'm a small business owner. So all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera, some of the other Western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here in California. It really does. Most people don't understand it, but it's also, besides the high taxes, there's a big immigration problem, which being born and raised here, most people don't see that, but it's the big tax on the social service system. And that's what makes our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's, but people don't seem to want to really deal with that, but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries and I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit and I've learned a couple of languages and I surf. Like what? I'm sorry? Like what? I didn't really understand your question. When you said like what, I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa, and I enjoy that and I enjoy warm climates now, especially where you can go and relax, where there's warm water to surf. It's the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. And I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Oh, sure. One of my favorite trips of all time, whereas I used to when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span, but about 10 years ago, we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city, even though I've been there about 10 times, we got to know the city really well, which was great. Really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping, but really having been there so many times, it really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about almost a month and really get to learn the city and it was fun. Even though I grew up in LA, I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I was younger, so my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable, but I took French all through elementary, junior high and high school. So it was nice to practice my French, even though I don't remember a whole lot, and even though I started speaking French with the French, my accent is some of the greatest, so after a couple of sentences, they start talking English to me. So that was a... Did you study at school? I have a few different degrees. So I was in Naval Science major as an undergraduate, and that was fun. And I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a degree in crisis management. What made you decide to do that? I found them interesting, and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college, I went to the Naval Academy, and I went there to play sports, and I found it real interesting, being from Southern California, going to school in Maryland. And I originally wanted to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. Are you still working in that? I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products, and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather, recently father, passed away, so I sort of run a 80-year-old family business, and it's pretty interesting. I like it, having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. What's your dream job? Actually, probably my dream job? I think it's fun, because I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home, and I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. Because I do have one daughter, and didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked, but I think I would be better than, say, a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids, that I like doing it always on a part-time basis, but it seems like, boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that, having pretty much worked for most of my life. An apartment never happened, but it sounds something that, to me, would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or a villain? I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert, whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted. But I think when I feel comfortable with certain people, and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be totally confident, or people I might have known for years, either from a personal or business situation. And be more introverted. I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy generally, and I like to use the term reserved. Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? What do you do to relax? Oh, wow, that's a great idea. I used to have that on one of my ... I have several computers at home, and that used to be one of my screensavers as well. I usually tend, when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events, I usually find exercise, whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach, maybe going surfing or the weather is warm. I don't surf in cold weather anymore. This makes ... It gives me like a brain freeze, even though I've surfed for over 30 years. I usually find exercise helps me relax the best, or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver. I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home. That's great. That was it. But that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master, though, was my relaxation skills. I probably didn't have them the best in my 20s, but over the years, I think I've gotten better at them. I think that's a key thing, and I think as we mature, as we learn how to do that, I wish I learned how to do that and be a little more ... I hadn't had those skills earlier. How are you at controlling your temper? I like to think I'm pretty good. I think I'm a lot better as well as that as I've aged. I am more likely to think before I speak now, whereas, say, 20 years ago, I was more likely to act before I thought. So I might have said more things that I ... In whatever tense situation, whether it be personal or a work situation, but I've never had a violent temper, but I would have a temper where I would fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it. I think I'm a lot better at that now than I was, say, in my teens or 20s. I think a lot of that comes ... I think the key word there is maturity. When was the last time you argued with someone and had to get it out? Oh, wow. You know, I was in the 20s. Oh, wow. You know, I haven't really had an argument with anybody in what I would consider a traditional argument. Probably my ex-wife, a number of years ago, we had an argument basically just over my daughter. It wasn't anything violent, but it was heated. Basically, one of the reasons we weren't married, our values were so different, just our ideas of parenting. And just outlook on life was so different, and I think that caused us to butt heads. But it was just ... I don't know if I call it an argument, but it was more of just one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads. How did you feel in that moment? I felt like I was talking to a wall, and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that, boy, before you get married, does someone have children with them? That's the kind of discussions that people should usually have, but you're not really thinking about that because sometimes when we're younger, we're looking at, boy, how does that ... I look great on paper to her, and she looked great on paper to me. But, you know, I'm pretty easygoing, and I have different ideas on raising children and how she did, and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right, not that I was right and she was wrong. It was just how we were raised and our just different views, and we never really discussed those things, but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads and weren't really a good match, whereas other things looked good on paper to both of us. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Um, there's one recent ... Like, my father passed away recently. Thank you. And really, because in our religion, you plan a funeral very quickly, you know, typically within a couple of days, and I really only invite very, very close friends and family members. I was more or less sort of in charge of it. My dad was remarried, but his widow was sort of not really up to it, so I took care of it and I wish I invited a ... I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it, so I really only invited big suspects of the time pressure, really just a handful of people, but now as time has passed, I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends, you know, 10 or 20 acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years, and I really just ... And even distant family members, I really just told after the fact. I really didn't invite them because I was under a time pressure, but I could have easily have done it via email, or it's hard to call everybody personally, but I wish ... That's something people have expressed a little. They were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me. Oh, you didn't tell me until after the fact that, you know, so-and-so had passed, so they all threw it at me because I was more or less doing it, so I wish I did that differently, but I did the best I could at the time, so I'm not really mad at myself. That's something I probably should have been more prepared for also, because it was something that was coming was inevitable, so ... I see. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, both of my parents are recently ... deceased in the last couple of years, and I had a brother that ... I have three of our brothers, one of who passed away in December, and we're not super close. Like I always ... Like I look at other families, we would just never like that Norman Rockwell painting because we're all so different, and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family. Not that it's strange, but I wish it was more like, boy, one of those families that got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that. We just never did that because we're all so different. Yeah. I understand. Yeah, that's ... Yeah, just being ... That's how it is, but to strangers, most people say, how do you get your family? Everybody's great, but I think every family has their own sort of stuff. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No, but I thought probably I could have had it before from some other events in my life, and I just wasn't sure I had been to some therapy in the past, just from ... I was in the military, and I was never really sure if that's exactly what it was, but I think I functioned pretty well, but I just wasn't sure that I had been to some therapy and counseling over the years. Why did you decide to go to the military? I didn't enlist. I was an officer. I went to one of the service academies. How old were you when you joined the military? Seventeen. I started one after high school, and I went to a service academy, so it's more prestigious, just isn't enlisting. It's the harder where I went. It's the hardest school in America to get into. You were very young, weren't you? I was, but I was the same age as everybody else who went there. Did you ever see combat? We did, 1983. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Just basically, it wasn't anything intense. We were just around ... We weren't allowed to carry ammunition. Our positions were just shelled at the time, and poison gas was sprayed on us, so that was ... It wasn't anything too intense. It was a lot, because the service I was in, the training is way more intense than any actual combat situation. Why? That's because they train you well. It's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete. If you play football, you practice harder than you actually play in the game. The same with if you're in a combat unit. Mm-hmm. How did serving in the military change you? It made me more patriotic, having grown up in California, whereas people were from all over the country. I got to meet, whereas most of my friends who grew up in affluent Los Angeles like I did, never really went out and met a lot of Americans and people from different backgrounds. I ended up becoming just more patriotic and had a deeper sense of pride in the country, whereas you really don't grow up with that in Southern California, whereas someone from Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana grows up with that kind of pride, so I thought it was good. Unlike so many of my friends, they don't know there's any life between Malibu and Manhattan. What did you do after the military? I went to graduate. I was still in the reserves, but I went to graduate school and I got two graduate degrees and I went to work in private enterprise. Didn't care for it that I joined the fire department. I was a firefighter and paramedic for a number of years. And then after I got divorced, it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter. So I went to work in a family business. That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep. I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I'm I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",
         "therapy like this instead of with a live human, it'll put all the MFTs out of business. I think it's good sometimes. I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to, if it's someone that might just go by their questions, might judge you or form opinions. If it's a virtual human being, it might be a little less biased also. I think it's a great idea. Or you can sit at home and do this instead of going into an office. Uh-huh. Yeah. Exactly. All right, so I'm going to start up all the recording and then I'm going to actually... I'm trying to slide on some pictures. Sorry, that's in there. Now she is... So now she's going to have a conversation with you. She's going to ask you some questions. When she's done, she'll let you know. And I'm going to leave you the doorbell so you can let me know when you're all finished. Thank you very much. How do I know... Is she going to say end of session or... Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you. Oh, I'm sorry. Not at all. Sorry about that. I am. I feel pretty good. I'm wide awake. I had a good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee. And I have an easy day today. So I am just going to chat with you. Then I'm going to the gym and run some errands. So I plan on having a nice day today. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I'm one of the few locals from around here. And I went to school away. But I'm one of the few natives that are actually in Los Angeles. Yes, I am. What are some things you really like about LA? I like the weather. Having owned a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida. I love the weather here. I like the culture. I like the diversity. I like the familiarity. I like the beaches. But I also like that just an hour and a half away, one can go to the desert, say Palm Springs, Palm Desert, but also another hour and a half, two hours away, you can go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that. And I think it's a great place to live. Thank you. Yeah. Well, maybe some of the things I don't like about LA or say California in general, say like the high tax rate, which the state tax rate is up to 13 point something now, which is going to chase business out of here. Also the regulations, I'm a small business owner. So all the regulations are clearly affecting business. So many of my peers have moved their businesses to Texas, Arizona, Nevada, et cetera, some of the other Western states that are less regulated. And that's a big problem here in California. It really does. Most people don't understand it, but it's also, besides the high taxes, there's a big immigration problem, which being born and raised here, most people don't see that, but it's the big tax on the social service system. And that's what makes our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of. So that's, but people don't seem to want to really deal with that, but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things, that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I enjoy traveling. I've been to 66 countries and I don't travel as much as I used to, but I've traveled quite a bit and I've learned a couple of languages and I surf. Like what? I'm sorry? Like what? I didn't really understand your question. When you said like what, I don't think you understood what I said, but I'll just go back and I've been all through Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, South America, North Africa, and I enjoy that and I enjoy warm climates now, especially where you can go and relax, where there's warm water to surf. It's the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up. And I also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and I try to eat healthy and that's a big part of my life. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. Oh, sure. One of my favorite trips of all time, whereas I used to when I was younger, see how many countries I can do in a relatively short period of time, say in a three or four week span, but about 10 years ago, we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city, even though I've been there about 10 times, we got to know the city really well, which was great. Really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping, but really having been there so many times, it really never stayed for more than three or four days. It was fun to stay there for about almost a month and really get to learn the city and it was fun. Even though I grew up in LA, I grew up taking French, which there wasn't a big Spanish speaking population when I was younger, so my mother insisted that all of us kids take French, even though Spanish would have been a lot more valuable, but I took French all through elementary, junior high and high school. So it was nice to practice my French, even though I don't remember a whole lot, and even though I started speaking French with the French, my accent is some of the greatest, so after a couple of sentences, they start talking English to me. So that was a... Did you study at school? I have a few different degrees. So I was in Naval Science major as an undergraduate, and that was fun. And I also have a master's degree in economics and I have a degree in crisis management. What made you decide to do that? I found them interesting, and it was something that I wanted to do. Where I went to college, I went to the Naval Academy, and I went there to play sports, and I found it real interesting, being from Southern California, going to school in Maryland. And I originally wanted to be a doctor, but once you start going to school for a little bit, you change your mind, et cetera. Are you still working in that? I'm actually in the wholesale business now. We're wholesale distributors of furniture products, and it was a family business, but I went to work there a number of years ago when my grandfather, recently father, passed away, so I sort of run a 80-year-old family business, and it's pretty interesting. I like it, having grown up around it, but it's different than other jobs I've had in the past. What's your dream job? Actually, probably my dream job? I think it's fun, because I've changed so much. I enjoy cooking and staying at home, and I would probably like to stay home and raise kids. Because I do have one daughter, and didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked, but I think I would be better than, say, a lot of women I know that want to work. I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids, that I like doing it always on a part-time basis, but it seems like, boy, that would be fun to stay home and do that, having pretty much worked for most of my life. An apartment never happened, but it sounds something that, to me, would be fun. Do you consider yourself more shy or a villain? I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers, but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable, I think I'm more of an extrovert, whereas more strangers might think I'm more introverted. But I think when I feel comfortable with certain people, and I don't know what it is, I can meet a stranger and be totally confident, or people I might have known for years, either from a personal or business situation. And be more introverted. I mean, I just go with the dynamics, but I think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy generally, and I like to use the term reserved. Okay.

I usually find exercise helps me relax the best, or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find very relaxing. But I like that screensaver.

That's pretty much my career in a nutshell. How easy was it for you to go back to civilian life? At first, it was difficult because I just had such a bearing on my butt from the way I walked. I talked. And again, I was an officer. You were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time. It was harder. It took me a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles. I think I handle it better than most. I have a stronger personality. So but it was a great experience. It all depends if I exercise regularly and I don't eat too late and things are going well in my life. I generally sleep pretty well. Even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now. But I generally sleep pretty well. I feel pretty good lately. I've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life. But by the last few months, I feel great. No, not really. I think I seem a little happier, more content lately. I thought maybe in the past, I do have a family history of it. And, you know, it wasn't anything real to debilitating. I wasn't able to really function on my own. But I was concerned with it and sought counseling. Do you feel like that is useful? I do. I was really against it in the past. And until after I went, I mean, I wish I went more safe during my marriage or the course of my life. Now, I think it's very useful. However, in the past, I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous. And it was a waste of money, et cetera. But I think it's a useful tool if you're open to it. What got you to seek help? Just some questions. I wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional, you know, about life, relationships. And sometimes it's good talking things out with a professional. Even though I wouldn't see somebody like you in real life. I prefer someone who's older than I am, a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger. I understand. So but, yeah, I think it's a useful tool. And I really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that. Do you still go to therapy now? I don't go now. I'm sort of taking a break from it, but I'm not against it. If I have some issues, I want to bounce off. I do have someone that I can go to. OK. Yeah. How has seeing a therapist affected you? I think it's nice. You know, they really if you go to someone who's good. And again, I've been to a few different people at sort of therapist shop. They really don't tell you what to think, which I think is great. You know, that's always in the past. It is help you talk through your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself. But bring a little clarity to the situation. That's why I like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience. And I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man. So but it's. I think it's a useful tool. I got some good ideas and was able to nice bouncing some things off totally someone who's unbiased. It's not in your day to day life. Instead of talking to a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you. But sometimes bouncing people off a stranger is good. This morning, I know this is weird, but I'm clearly someone. And I'd say this is a joke to my friends and family and associates. I clearly have having an easy day today because I knew we had nice weather and I had a bunch of errands to run. And I clearly have seasonal affective disorder. But I woke up so happy today when I know it's going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice, I'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and cold. Where I always I know that time. So I woke up really happy today because I know it's going to be a nice day. And I look forward to feeling the sun. Most of my friends, I'm sort of a Renaissance man. I know a little bit about a lot of subjects. I'm too smart for my own good. And I know a lot about a lot of things. I'm pretty rational, very resourceful. People always call me when they have issues and I help talk them through it or resourceful and tell them where to go. Whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or. You know, I'm great with medical diagnoses. And, you know, people also say I'm a lot of fun. I'm fun to be with. And I also have I don't have a lot of gray areas. People either really like me or don't like me. For me, things are pretty much black and white. I am what I am. I don't be us. You know, I'm the opposite of a politician. So I don't tell people what they want to hear. I don't be rude, not rude to anybody, but pretty much call things as I see them. So that's pretty much. No, not really. I do everything tactfully. I like to think I do. Is there anything you regret? I would just probably spent more time with my parents before they passed, but it's busy. I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger. But just a lot of it's very typical. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Really to think things through a little bit more, be a little less impulsive. Pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now. I think that's it. And I would look at things in the long term instead of looking at things in the short term. You know, you make decisions or choices. I'm proud of my daughter. She's a nice young lady. I am proud of my public service. I've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service. There are very few people like me who did it, who is at the background and education that I did. But I like public service. And so I'm proud of that. I'm proud of all the certificates that I have hanging on my walls at home and degrees. Sort of like trophies. I'm proud that I've been able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and knock wood, maintain good health. It was nice meeting you. Bye bye. Thank you. How was I? Fantastic. And then I'll have you move over and finish up with a quick poster. It's like those old fashioned, you know, like, Ray Bans like this. Oh, yeah.",
         "I've experienced periods of feeling blue in the past, and I have a family history of it. While these times were concerning, they weren't debilitating, and I was generally able to function on my own. I sought counseling for these concerns, initially being against therapy, but now I find it very useful for gaining clarity and talking through my thoughts and feelings with an unbiased professional, especially an older woman. I also clearly experience seasonal affective disorder; I feel much happier when the weather is nice and sunny, but I tend to feel dark and blue when it's rainy and cold. To relax and manage stress, I rely on exercise like yoga, walking, going to the gym, or surfing, and sometimes just vegging out on the couch. I've worked on mastering these relaxation skills, especially as I've gotten older. I've also improved my emotional regulation; in my younger years, I was more impulsive and would fly off the handle, but now I think before I speak and reflect more. I do regret not spending more time with my parents before they passed and not spending as much time with my daughter when she was younger.",

         " Okay, sounds good. Yeah. I'm great. I'm great. Thank you. Where are you from originally? Los Angeles, California. Really? What are some things you really like about LA? I like the diversity. I feel LA by itself is a country. There's so much to do, so much to explore. And there's nothing like it. I feel the same. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I like to travel more though. I've been to a few countries. Like what? I've been to, I won't say Europe, that's a continent. I've been to London. I was born here, but my family's from Nigeria, so I've been to Nigeria a few times. I've been to Denmark, Amsterdam. I've been to Germany. And I think that's it. Awesome. What are you enjoying about traveling? Just exploring new places, seeing new things, meeting new people, a different culture. It definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it. And also going to countries that may not be as developed as the US, it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of this country. I'd love to hear about London because... I'm not sure if you can hear me, but I'm in LA. But at the same time, you can go at a very, very slow pace. We didn't do any driving. We just went on the Tube, which is there, like the underground subway station, which I absolutely fell in love with. Just exploring different parts of the city. We went to Big Ben, Westminster Abbey. When I went there, they had the premiere of, what movie was this, Slumdog Millionaire. And also they had the premiere for Seven Pounds, it was a movie with Will Smith. They did, so Will Smith was over there. Me and my friends were kind of screaming like we were groupies. Just for antics. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. That sounds like a great situation. What did you study at school? Business management and option and human resources management. What that means, I have no idea. How did you decide to do that? Good question. I've always wanted to go into business. And I've always wanted to study finance, but I didn't think I would learn too much about finance from college per se. I think I learned more in the real world, whatnot. So the other option was human resource. And I'm always fascinated about relationships and people, always reading articles about that stuff. So I went for that. Are you still doing that? No. Well, I still kind of use what I've learned, but I work in property management. So it still has to do with people. Anything to do with people, I'm fascinated about. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for you. What's your dream job? That's a good one. My dream job. Wow. I would say being a life coach. Really? Yeah, I would say that was my dream job because I love helping people become successes. And I love being a part of someone else's success, regardless of how small it is. Whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation. You consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm quiet into myself. So, yeah. Right. To relax. I usually listen to music. I usually listen to music to relax me or I pray to relax myself or listen to some really calm music. So, yeah. Very good. Very, very good. I used to, I wouldn't say it was a bad temper, but I was known to go off, quote unquote. Not throwing chairs or anything like that. I'm a very, very patient person. Once that patient is gone and for you to do that, you have to really, really, really, really push my buttons for a long time. And once it's done, I just go off. Has that gotten you in trouble? No. No. What was the last time you argued with somebody? The last time I argued with somebody. Wow. I haven't argued with somebody in a long time. Boy. I argued with my, no. I would say my, I think my dad, I argued with him. About We were disagreeing on some things about when we were going to supposed to go back to Nigeria. And he wasn't listening to, it was kind of like a group discussion, myself and my, my siblings, and he was being very subjective. He wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns. So it started an argument. How did you feel about having to? Very I wouldn't say angry per se, but I felt very kind of like I was losing control. Like I'm the type where I like to be in control of my emotions and my thoughts and I feel once that patience is gone and I start going off, it's kind of like this. This, you know, I would call it a blur, but I'm very witty and quick with what I say. So I'll instantly say something that, you know, Not to say hurtful, but very direct and to the point. I make sure I get my point across. Yeah. I have three brothers, one, one younger, two older, and very close to my family and my mom was one of my best friends. My brothers are great. Love them to death. My father. He's more so out of the picture. Yeah. I don't I don't really I'm not the guilty type. I don't feel guilty. I'm not one to shy away from what I've done and I definitely own up to what I do. I'm not one to shy away from responsibility, but I don't think I ever feel guilty for anything I do. Yeah, I don't think I feel I usually don't feel guilty. Yeah. Pretty, pretty easy. Pretty easy at, you know, pretty good at falling asleep, except when I'm excited or I'm reading. I'm trying to when I'm when I'm focused on learning something like I'll read and read and read, even when it's past my bedtime. But now I'm trying to work on waking up much earlier than when I am now. And that's kind of a little bit of a struggle, but I'm getting to it. So. Good. I've been feeling I've been feeling fine. You know, I'm generally I have a very, very happy disposition. And so no, you know, deep, depressing moods, nothing like that. I will never if I feel do feel like I'm going I don't allow myself to go to that place. No. No. I would say it's I wouldn't say necessary changes, but I'd say more so behaviors, learning how to let go of past decisions, maybe. And kind of how they they played their course in my life. I just sometimes I kind of look back and say, what if I did this? What would have how would life be now? Yeah. So those are some games I play. But other than that, that's it. Is there anything regret? Hmm. Regrets. Uh, no, no, there's anything I regret. What advice would you give yourself? 10 or 20 years ago, I would say, don't be afraid of who you are. Be authentic. More importantly, with yourself. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Hmm. Erase from my memory. Uh, that's a good one. Erase from my memory. Uh, I would say when I told my dad that he should act like a father. Maybe I should. Yeah, there was. That was actually one of the times I another time I went off, usually with him. Basically, I had decided not to go to a private, not to go away for college. I decided to stay local so I can look after my little brother. And my senior year, I was overloading with everything I had maybe like four AP classes. I was working. I was working three jobs at the time, and I was also on track and field. So, needless to say, I was kind of like burning myself out. And I wasn't doing one AP calculus because I decided to go to a JC first and transfer. Also to save money for college too. And when I told them, you know, the teacher called saying I was falling asleep in class. Just because, mind you, after school I'd work an eight hour shift because I was a retail manager at the time. So, and I'd come home after that shift to do homework, calculus let alone. So, he would get upset and I told him, I spoke to my counselor. I already told him that I don't need that class to go to the JC. Because that's something I'm going to continue with. So I'm just going to, I can't drop out at that point in time. So I'm just going to, you know, just take the D or fail or whatever. And he didn't like that because he is a teacher. I think maybe that's maybe where it came from. He's a teacher as well. And so he started blaming like my job, wanting to call my boss. And it was just too much. And I told him, you know, since you're my father you should act like it. But it was a more aggressive way I said it. So that was one thing. Well, I actually, I do remember, I do regret one thing. And that is I wish I continued with college throughout. Like I burnt myself out. I was spreading myself too thin. I was actually on track to graduate from college at, I want to say 19. Because I started taking college classes in high school, starting sophomore year in high school. But with that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working, I just kind of like stopped going to school for a while and just worked. But I went back to finish. So, but I wish I just would have continued. Maybe that's one small thing, but that's something small though. Yeah. What would you say as somebody who has qualities? I'm very, I'm a very compassionate and understanding person. I like learning new things. I'm a very, very happy person. People come to me for advice. I'm very objective. I'll tell you the good, the bad, the ugly. And yeah, those are some of my best qualities. I'm fun. I like to have fun. I have fun in any situation. I can make light of any situation. Like I'm the kind of type person I can break the tension in the room. That sort of, that sort of personality trait. Cool. Yeah. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Michelle's taller. Besides my height. Hmm. I wish maybe. I don't know if it's a be more. I want to say be more in touch with my emotions, but I think I would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes. I think that would be one thing because I'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me. And I'm like, okay, great. Thank you. I appreciate that. But I don't realize how much they do. I think that's realizing how much they care and love me. That's one thing I would like to get more of a grasp on. Yeah. How would your best friend describe you? My best friend. She describes me as someone who's funny, crazy, objective, loyal, ambitious, hardworking, mean. I always make jokes. She says, you're so mean. But. Why? I just like to joke around all the time. And so we were right now actually planning a friend of mine or friend of ours, a baby shower. I'm giving her some ideas. And there's another friend who was invited who we had some issues in the past and someone I don't talk to or hang out with. We used to be really close, but I don't really talk to a person, but I don't mind them being there. So she also talked about celebrating her birthday. Also, kind of like after the baby shower. And there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we didn't do anything for. And I'm like, well, we're celebrating this person's birthday. Might as well. We should definitely honor this person's birthday as well, since we're closer to the person whose birthday is past. And I said, you know what? Just when we celebrate everybody's birthday, forget the baby shower, just do the birthdays. And then she said, you're so mean. But she was laughing about it. So, yeah. Yeah. What are you most proud of in your life? Most proud of in my life? I would say being there for my family. Being a mentally and emotionally strong person. Family has gone through a lot of challenges, and a lot of times I've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and make sure everything goes accordingly. So I'd say more than anything, making sure I'm there for my family. Okay. I think that's everything I need to say. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. Bye. Have a good one. Okay. I can take this off? Okay. You wouldn't be the first one to tell her that. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay. I'm going to take this off. Okay.

         "I've been feeling really down for about six months now. It started after a major project at work fell through, and since then, it's just been a constant heavy sadness, like a dark cloud hanging over me. I often feel this overwhelming sense of hopelessness and guilt, especially about not being productive or feeling like a burden to my family. Sometimes I just feel numb, and other times I get really irritable, even snapping at my family, which I regret. I've completely lost interest in things I used to love, like reading or hiking; there's just no joy or pleasure in anything anymore.\n\nMy daily life has been severely impacted. I have trouble falling asleep, often waking up multiple times during the night, but then I also oversleep significantly, yet still feel completely exhausted. My appetite is gone; I eat very little, sometimes even forgetting to eat at all. I've been isolating myself a lot, cancelling plans with friends because I just don't have the energy to socialize, and I feel like I'm pushing them away. Even basic tasks like showering feel like a monumental effort. I have no energy, struggle to get out of bed, and can't concentrate on anything, especially work, which has caused my productivity to plummet. I've missed a lot of work and I'm worried about losing my job. My family has been trying to help and my partner is worried about me, but it's hard to accept help when I feel this way. I often find myself just staying in bed, watching TV mindlessly, or avoiding responsibilities, and I've been having some really dark thoughts.",

         " Are there any parameters? I mean, should I just talk naturally or just however I'm comfortable? Whatever you're comfortable, just talk naturally. I'm going to go ahead and just fix this. Just one spot, sorry. Okay, great. One last thing. Perfect. So again, she'll let you know when she's done. I'm going to hand you the doorbell, but I'll try to keep an eye on the time as well. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay. Where are you from originally? I was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA? Originally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA is very has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just sort of I don't know if estranged is the right word but I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. How hard is that? It's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy. So it doesn't really answer your question but Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tape and I'm not sure what I'm doing. I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? I have certain I do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really it soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed. When was the last time that happened? A few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing. How did you decide to do that? I've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me. How hard is that? It's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good. I see what you mean. How are you at controlling your temper? Good. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. What's something you feel guilty about? A lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really really that I really wanted to work and I I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and not and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty that was pretty tough. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Well some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have I don't know I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were. I think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself. I mean it's it's possible I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Well it's it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better. That's good. How do you cope with them? Um well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using I'm the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can't yet. Are they triggered by something? They're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to to this. It's really it's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't I don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep. So it's just only recently that I've really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. Like I would I would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work. But now it's it's like if I do that I can't I still don't get enough sleep. I don't know. I get up, I toss and turn all night. You know and now it's just it's yeah I don't sleep too great right now. What are you like when you don't sleep well? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's hard to know. I usually just kind of power through it and just I'm like how I am now. I just feel bad. Okay. How long ago were you diagnosed? I think three, three, four years ago. It was when I I had been given taken stuff for anxiety for years before that. But then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation. We need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working. You need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this. So yeah that was kind of a turning point. But unfortunately it happened after everything went bad. So How did you feel in that moment? In the moment I don't know. I don't really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel it really makes me angry. It really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I'm that I had that I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain and I lost everything because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me. I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now What got you to say help? What got you to say help? What got you to say help? Um Um There really wasn't any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either I was I was self-medicating I was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but It was at least that and not firing me. But but but yeah but so I got help but it was. But it wasn't soon enough. Not not as much as I should. I go to a couple of meetings. I go to I go to a so that I can. You know keep control of that aspect to to and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that. Unfortunately you know being unemployed my employment ran out you know I'm I'm you know I'm getting my medication from the city of L.A. So you know I'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody. Somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it's really very I've only seen her three times in the past year. So it's basically to keep my medication coming. And then there's you. Right. Well like I said I mean. Just the talk I mean that let's just take the A.A. for example because that's probably the closest closest for them seeing with therapy right now. Just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out. Trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense. That you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something that you can do. Something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing. You know better than I that I have been. I mean. It's sort of it has its ups and downs. You know I'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again. It's hard but that's like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the depression is getting under control. So now it's just I have to deal with real life which is. It has its own challenge. Yeah. Yeah. It can be tough to find a good job. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um. It was probably you know a couple of years ago. Um. I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind. Is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree. And we spent all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel. You know for that instant I felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and. I mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and. Part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that. I don't know if I'll ever feel that again. So. What are you most proud of? Probably the. Probably this. Educate educational series I did. Educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation. It was. It was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about. And about the world around them so that I feel like that was a really good thing to do. The world. my job. It was a, we were trying to come up with new ideas for, because we would put together videos and stuff to give to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot to it so it was probably the biggest project that the NSF had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it. Awesome. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend? I don't know. I don't know, it's been a while since I've really thought about that. I don't know, would I go somewhere? Would I? I don't know. Thank you. Howdy. Thank you.",
         "Here is the cleaned transcript:\n\nAre there any parameters? I mean, should I just talk naturally or just however I'm comfortable? Whatever you're comfortable, just talk naturally. I'm going to go ahead and just fix this. Just one spot, sorry. Okay, great. One last thing. Perfect. So again, she'll let you know when she's done. I'm going to hand you the doorbell, but I'll try to keep an eye on the time as well. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. So, how are you doing today? I'm okay. I'm a little pensive, I guess. A little down, but more or less okay. Where are you from originally? I was born in Annapolis, Maryland on the East Coast. Why did you move to LA? Originally, I moved because I went to film school. But then I decided to come, I moved back to Washington, DC to do some work and now I'm back here again. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? It's very different being from the East Coast. It just has a different feel to it. But living LA has a very different kind of attitude, I guess. And so it's a little difficult, but I've gotten more used to it since I've been here. How often do you go back to your hometown? Not at all. When I left, things got sort of, I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to be with some people who were going to help me out and I'm just sort of I don't know if estranged is the right word but I'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often. How hard is that? It's not easy. I miss a lot of people. I miss my old life before I lost my job. I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there. So it's difficult. I mean it weighs on my mind a lot. I feel like I failed and now I'm here and I can't seem to get back on my feet. So it's hard. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Depends on the situation. I think I'm outgoing when I'm comfortable and then I'm extremely outgoing but when I'm in a situation I'm not comfortable with I tend to be a lot more shy. So it doesn't really answer your question but Okay. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tape and I'm not sure what I'm doing. I turn on the fish tape screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii but it's the festive guy. What do you do to relax? I do a lot of writing. I have certain music that I listen to as I'm writing and when I can get really into that and shut out the rest of the world the music and the thoughts happening really it soothes me. It's when I feel most relaxed. When was the last time that happened? A few weeks ago I guess I've been working on a book, on a novel and when I was really getting into writing it and it was really working for me that was good. That was really good. I felt like I was accomplishing something and I felt really relaxed. It was about a guy who was searching for something. It's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on earth with her. Just because. It's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing. How did you decide to do that? I've been meaning to write a novel but I was just waiting for the idea to really hit me. How hard is that? It's not easy. The parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle. I find it difficult. I have a real love-hate relationship with writing. When I love it I just absolutely love it. But sometimes I hate it because it's so difficult. But it's worth it for the times when it's good. I see what you mean. How are you at controlling your temper? Good. I don't really have a temper. Most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people. If something is really stressful or if I'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it. But that's probably only happened to me three or four times in my whole life. Generally I pretty much try to when I'm upset I get upset with myself not with other people. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget. It was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I had already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay. So it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I ended up being wrong on that one. But it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument. What's something you feel guilty about? A lot so much. I was in a relationship that I really wanted to work and I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn't I wasn't on the right medication and so I was going like everything sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended. I wasn't mean but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn't stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and not and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again. So that was pretty tough. Can you have done anything to avoid it? Well some of it was that I wasn't medicated properly. I mean now I've been to a doctor and I'm on medication that's completely kind of I mean I still get upset and I still get depressed but it's not like it was. It's not I don't completely lose it for days at a time. So I mean I know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then it would have probably been different. If I was who I am now then I would have been, it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but I mean I could have, I don't know if I could have done anything different. Things being how they were. I think that maybe you're being a little hard on yourself. I mean it's possible I mean obviously yeah because I mean that's what I do. I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until it drives me crazy. I dwell on stuff. And it's like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day. I mean I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago which I shouldn't even be thinking about anymore because it's so in the past but I still get that feeling like I'm right back there. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Well it's not easy. I've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it. I mean I dealt with it for a long time by drinking and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way. But you know since the medication it's been better. It hasn't been impossible to deal with. It hasn't been easy but it's been better. That's good. How do you cope with them? Um well like I said I do a lot of you know if I'm writing or if I'm doing anything like I kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely. Um if I'm watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone. If I'm using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that. I just need I mean I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just can't yet. Are they triggered by something? They're triggered by everything. Pretty much anything that I see. If I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know people talk about just anything you know I can reach back and connect to this. It's really I don't know. That's the thing. I mean I don't ever get a break from it. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I'm a very light sleeper so I'm awake and asleep and awake and asleep. I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don't know. I'd never really needed much sleep.

         "I'm feeling a little pensive and down today. My old life, before I lost my job, weighs on my mind a lot; I miss my friends and relationships and feel like I failed, unable to get back on my feet. Most of my anger is directed inward. I still feel immense guilt about a past relationship that ended badly because I wasn't on the right medication, causing everything to spiral out of control. I dwell on things constantly, taking little details and thinking about them until it drives me crazy. Even things from high school can still make me feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, and ashamed, like I'm right back there.\n\nMy sleep isn't great; I'm a very light sleeper, tossing and turning all night, and I'm really starting to feel the effects of not getting enough sleep. I'm also pretty estranged from my family and old friends. My mental state significantly impacted my work, leading to me being laid off after being institutionalized once or twice. It makes me angry that I lost everything due to brain chemistry and inadequate help from previous doctors.\n\nI was diagnosed with depression about three or four years ago, though I was on anxiety medication for years before that. Now, with the right medication, I still get upset and depressed, but I don't completely lose it for days at a time like I used to. For a long time, I coped by drinking to slow my mind down. Now, to manage my thoughts, I have to keep my brain constantly occupied, often doing two things at once, like playing a game on my phone while watching TV. I wish I could just let the thoughts come and deal with them, but I can't yet. These thoughts are triggered by everything – anything I see or hear can connect back to them, and I never get a break.\n\nI go to AA meetings, which has a therapy aspect, and I have a psychiatrist, though I only see her a few times a year to keep my medication coming since I'm unemployed. Saying things out loud, trying to make sense of the mess in my head, is a big step. While the chemical parts of my depression feel more under control now, I'm still dealing with real-world problems like applying for jobs daily and never getting a response, which makes it hard to feel self-sufficient. The last time I felt truly happy was a couple of years ago, when everything was going well, and I felt like a normal person, and I don't know if I'll ever feel that again.",

I'm from Guatemala. My parents migrated here to the United States when I was like three years old. So, yeah. Really? Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been there, actually. I haven't been back to my hometown since forever. Why? Just, you know, I have all my family here, my mom, my dad, my cousins, aunts, uncles. So, practically, I have my life here. So, I probably, I mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know, just my curiosity hasn't, you know, gone there, I guess. Okay. What's your favorite part about Guatemala? I love the people. Everyone's nice. I love the diversity, you know. There's different types of people and imaginations out there. You know, everything's just great. You know, everyone's different, you know. No one's like the same, at least to some aspects. And I love the scenery. I love, you know, the mountains. They're beautiful, you know, great for hikes, you know, taking out, you know, the dog, the family, you know. It's nice. It's pretty active. Yeah. What is your favorite smog? The smog. I don't like the smog. It's just, you know, if you go out further out, you know, you could tell by the air, you know, or, you know, everything's clear. The sky's bluer. But other than that, like, you know, in traffic, nobody likes traffic, I think. Yeah. But yeah, that's, you know, pretty much LA is pretty nice, you know. I like it. That's good. What did you study at school? Well, I was studying just basic, you know. I'm not sure exactly what I want to be. So it's just kind of, you know, here and there, just jumping through hoops and stuff. So not really set yet. It's still trying to find my interest, I suppose. What's your dream job? My dream job. That's a good one. I love working with children. So I would say probably a child psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what's going on in the young minds and, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, make children, you know, or help, you know, help them, you know, grow up in a positive way, I suppose, instead of, like, going the wrong track. Yeah. I just, you know, help children. Is it just so high-five or up-going? It depends. It depends on the situation I'm in. Sometimes, you know, I could be, like, super outgoing and just, like, you know, and sometimes I could just, I could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention, you know, if I'm, like, in class or whatever. I don't really, like, and there's everyone talking. I just, I prefer just to stay away from that, you know, because I need something else to concentrate on something else. You know, there's, like, a moment in time for everything, I suppose. Yeah. Sometimes when I'm being there, I turn on the first page of the screen favorite. Hey, I know it's not blind, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I like to kick my feet up on the couch and, like, read a good book, you know, just get my mind going to another, you know, galaxy or universe or situation, you know. It's pretty fun, you know, just, you know, reading and then just having yourself relaxed and, you know, feeling good. That's great. Yeah, it is. It's just fun. I love reading. How are you at controlling your own mood? I'm okay with it. I'm not, like, the best, you know, temper-controlling person there is out there. You know, I try my best and I guess that's all I could do until I keep doing better eventually. But I'm not, like, the best. I mean, I sometimes I do have my outbursts, you know. But, you know, I guess that's everyone. I'm not sure. When was the last time you argued with him? Ah, huh. That's a good question. That's a good question. I don't remember. Let's see. Honestly, I can't recall. Maybe. My goodness. I don't know. Sometimes I'm very passive. That's just like let things go because, I mean, what's the point of making a big deal out of things? You know, so, huh, I don't know. I honestly I can't tell you that at this moment. Why don't we talk about that later? Sure. Yeah, probably come back to it. What's something with your relationship? Um, huh. Well, I guess when I was younger, I, you know, could have been better older sister and I wasn't. And that makes me feel guilty for sure. You know, I could have been a better sister. Better role model. But I'm trying my best now, so I'm trying to make things better. And it's working. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your ex-wife. Oh, I guess, huh. Hmm. I don't know. I mean, I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life. So if I erase something, then it's just there's something of me in my present self or, you know, that would change. And I don't know. I'm pretty OK with the person that I am now. I mean, you know, I don't think I would change an event. You know, I'm OK with what, you know, ups and downs and good and bad that has happened. OK. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. But I am kind of like an explorer, I guess. I love to explore, like, even the smallest things. Like if I go hiking, I go off trail and, you know, just find my way up to the top, you know, somehow some way and just make it, you know, traveling. I would love to do that. But I don't know, just, you know, always circumstances in my life that doesn't, you know, always something, you know, I get married, children, you know, and all this. So it's kind of like, you know, it would be nice, I guess, you know, it would be nice. You know, I love camping. That's kind of like, you know, taking a few days trips out there, camping and fishing. Yeah. It was this summer, you know, me and my husband went camping and it was really nice. It was just me and him, you know, and it was like no one. And it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake. And, you know, it was it was really nice. It was just, yeah. Yeah, yeah, it was. It was. It was really fun. It was like I would love to do it again, you know, right now. It would be great, you know, just going out there. It's just I love that venture of things and the nature and just life and, you know, overall. Yeah. It's easy, but lately I haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because I don't know, just, you know, just I'm laying there and I'm just like trying to go to sleep and I'm just like, oh, but eventually I do. You know, I just I probably like need to position myself in a different side of the bed. Like sometimes I'm in the headboard and I'm like, oh, I got to go to the other side. And once I position myself, then I just like go to sleep, you know, but it just I got to find the right position for me. Yeah. Um, I'm tired. I get tired throughout the day, you know, but I kind of try to shake it off, you know, and just kind of like feel like it's a new day, you know, and just try to make the day that I have as great as possible, you know, and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of, you know. So, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just, you know, it's OK. I try to make it the best, I guess. If not, then I just go to sleep throughout the day, which sucks. But yeah. No. No. I've been feeling good. Yeah, I've been feeling really good. You know, a lot of things in my life have, you know, I'm having a really good year so far. So I'm very happy with that. You know, everything's, you know, going good, you know. Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. It is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible. But that's just nature. My immune system has to work harder. Super happy was when the doctor told me I was pregnant. You know, I was really, really happy about that. And I was just like, oh, you know, that was really, really good. You know, very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby. And, oh, that's very overwhelming. And it's scary at the same time. I've never really like, you know, but yeah, I'm very happy. Yeah. I don't know. I guess just me myself, you know, like, you know, I could, you know, just be myself and that's it. You know, just I can't really, you know, say I have a specific thing, I guess. I mean, it depends on the person that meets me to tell me. I can't really tell myself like, oh, I'm this, I'm that, you know, just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to, you know, tell me or, you know, compliment me or whatnot. Yeah. Oh, nothing, I think. Um, like I said, I'm happy with the person I am right now. And, you know, my flaws or whatever, you know, I might have, I don't know, whatever flaw people see in me and it's OK. You know, I'm OK with it. Whatever it just I'm not going to I can't change myself for the likings of other people. I have only one body and one life. So, yeah, yeah, that's it. Ah, just my childhood with my sisters and my family. But, you know, it's, you know, you learn from that, you learn from the past and you kind of feel like, hey, you know, maybe I should be a better role model, you know, for my children. And so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve. Um, just smile and be happy, you know, and whatever hard things happen, you know, you're going to get through them eventually, you know, the only thing you can't do is to be happy. You can't, I don't know, you can't, you know, go back on his death. You know, you could, you know, a heartbreak or whatever. But, you know, as long as I'm alive, I still got to keep going. Yeah. I don't know. That's pretty, huh, most proud of. I guess that I'm trying my best to be the best I could be. And that's pretty powerful. You know, I'm, you know, I try to be, you know, a better person each day and try to like, you know, improve myself every day as much as I can. You know, that would probably be something I could be super proud of, you know, as much as I can. Very hard. I'm not going to lie. It is really hard, you know, because I can't say, you know, it's easy to be bad, but it's hard to be good. You know, and, you know, it's always challenges and everything that goes, you know, in your life. But, you know, it's just it's sometimes, you know, hard, you know, and sometimes it comes easy, you know, after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try, you know. So, yeah. You know, loving, friendly, outgoing, you know, adventures, I guess. I don't know. That's what they say. Just, you know, that's them. Like, you know, but that's what at least what I try to be. You know, at least I try to give the best foot forward always as much as possible. You know, even sometimes even if I'm having a rough day, I'm just like, oh, you know, you know, I just I don't want to be bad. You know, I just I don't want to take it out on anyone or anything, you know. Yeah. Yeah. How do you spend your ideal weekend? My ideal weekend. Usually I like going to the park. I like sitting down in like a tree under a tree, actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there, have my dog and like read a book. And, you know, sometimes if I don't have my dog, like there's little scrolls running around and they like me to feed them. So that's pretty neat, you know, just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise, I guess, because there's not silence. You know, the wind and the cars and, you know, it's just it's really neat. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye. Bye.",
         "Okay, awesome. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. You know, how about yourself? I'm great. Awesome. Where are you from? I'm from Guatemala. My parents migrated here to the United States when I was like three years old. So, yeah. Really? Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's pretty cool, you know. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been there, actually. I haven't been back to my hometown since forever. Why? Just, you know, I have all my family here, my mom, my dad, my cousins, aunts, uncles. So, practically, I have my life here. So, I probably, I mean, it would be nice to visit, but, you know, just my curiosity hasn't, you know, gone there, I guess. Okay. What's your favorite part about Guatemala? I love the people. Everyone's nice. I love the diversity, you know. There's different types of people and imaginations out there. You know, everything's just great. You know, everyone's different, you know. No one's like the same, at least to some aspects. And I love the scenery. I love, you know, the mountains. They're beautiful, you know, great for hikes, you know, taking out, you know, the dog, the family, you know. It's nice. It's pretty active. Yeah. What is your favorite smog? The smog. I don't like the smog. It's just, you know, if you go out further out, you know, you could tell by the air, you know, or, you know, everything's clear. The sky's bluer. But other than that, like, you know, in traffic, nobody likes traffic, I think. Yeah. But yeah, that's, you know, pretty much LA is pretty nice, you know. I like it. That's good. What did you study at school? Well, I was studying just basic, you know. I'm not sure exactly what I want to be. So it's just kind of, you know, here and there, just jumping through hoops and stuff. So not really set yet. It's still trying to find my interest, I suppose. What's your dream job? My dream job. That's a good one. I love working with children. So I would say probably a child psychologist just because, you know, it's great, you know, to learn what's going on in the young minds and, you know, how we could help children develop a better way, you know, make children, or help them, grow up in a positive way, I suppose, instead of, like, going the wrong track. Yeah. I just, you know, help children. Is it just so high-five or up-going? It depends. It depends on the situation I'm in. Sometimes, you know, I could be, like, super outgoing and just, like, you know, and sometimes I could just be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention, you know, if I'm, like, in class or whatever. I don't really, like, and there's everyone talking. I just prefer to stay away from that, you know, because I need to concentrate on something else. You know, there's, like, a moment in time for everything, I suppose. Yeah. What do you do to relax? I like to kick my feet up on the couch and, like, read a good book, you know, just get my mind going to another, you know, galaxy or universe or situation, you know. It's pretty fun, you know, just, you know, reading and then just having yourself relaxed and, you know, feeling good. That's great. Yeah, it is. It's just fun. I love reading. How are you at controlling your own mood? I'm okay with it. I'm not, like, the best, you know, temper-controlling person there is out there. You know, I try my best and I guess that's all I could do until I keep doing better eventually. But I'm not, like, the best. I mean, I sometimes I do have my outbursts, you know. But, you know, I guess that's everyone. I'm not sure. When was the last time you argued with him? Ah, huh. That's a good question. I don't remember. Let's see. Honestly, I can't recall. Maybe. My goodness. I don't know. Sometimes I'm very passive. That's just like let things go because, I mean, what's the point of making a big deal out of things? You know, so, huh, I don't know. I honestly can't tell you that at this moment. Why don't we talk about that later? Sure. Yeah, probably come back to it. What's something with your relationship? Um, huh. Well, I guess when I was younger, I, you know, could have been better older sister and I wasn't. And that makes me feel guilty for sure. But I'm trying my best now to make things better. And it's working. Yeah. Tell me about your relationship with your ex-wife. Oh, I guess, huh. Hmm. I don't know. I mean, I'm the person I am because of the events that have happened in my life. So if I erase something, then it's just there's something of me in my present self or, you know, that would change. And I don't know. I'm pretty OK with the person that I am now. I mean, you know, I don't think I would change an event. You know, I'm OK with what, you know, ups and downs and good and bad that has happened. OK. Yeah. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I can't see your shoes, but I don't travel a lot. But I am kind of like an explorer, I guess. I love to explore, like, even the smallest things. Like if I go hiking, I go off trail and, you know, just find my way up to the top, you know, somehow some way and just make it, you know, traveling. I would love to do that. But I don't know, just, you know, always circumstances in my life that doesn't, you know, always something, you know, I get married, children, you know, and all this. So it's kind of like, you know, it would be nice, I guess. You know, I love camping. That's kind of like, you know, taking a few days trips out there, camping and fishing. Yeah. It was this summer, you know, me and my husband went camping and it was really nice. It was just me and him, you know, and it was like no one. And it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake. And, you know, it was really nice. It was just, yeah. It was really fun. I would love to do it again, you know, right now. It would be great, you know, just going out there. It's just I love that venture of things and the nature and just life and, you know, overall. Yeah. It's easy, but lately I haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because I don't know, just, you know, just I'm laying there and I'm just like trying to go to sleep and I'm just like, oh, but eventually I do.

So, yeah, it's just, you know, it's OK. I try to make it the best, I guess. If not, then I just go to sleep throughout the day, which sucks. But yeah. No. I've been feeling good. Yeah, I've been feeling really good. You know, a lot of things in my life have, you know, I'm having a really good year so far. So I'm very happy with that. You know, everything's, you know, going good, you know. Yeah, it is. Except that I just got out of a cold and it was horrible. But that's just nature. My immune system has to work harder.

         "I've been feeling really good lately, actually, and I'm having a very happy year so far with everything going well, especially since I found out I'm pregnant, which makes me very excited, though it's also overwhelming and scary. However, I do have some challenges. Lately, I haven't been able to fall asleep right away at night; I just lie there trying to find the right position. This makes me tired throughout the day, and sometimes I end up sleeping during the day, which I don't like. I try to shake off the tiredness and make the day as great as possible. I also admit I'm not the best at controlling my mood and sometimes have outbursts, but I try my best to improve. A past feeling that makes me feel guilty is not having been a better older sister when I was younger, but I'm working to make things better now. Despite any hard things that happen, I believe I'll get through them and I always try to smile and be happy, striving to be the best person I can be every day. Even on rough days, I make sure not to take it out on anyone. To relax, I love reading a good book to get my mind going, and I also enjoy camping and being out in nature.",

         " Since there's nothing else Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are totally confidential. Are you okay with this? Yeah. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty okay. Thanks for asking. How are you? That's good. I'm great. Thanks. Where are you from originally? I'm from here in LA. I grew up in the San Fernando Valley. Really? Yeah. What are some things you really like about LA? Cool. What are some things you don't really like about LA? I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? What do you enjoy about traveling? I love traveling. I like experiencing new things. I think that would be nice. Despite the fact that I said I like the familiarity of LA, there's also fun in discovering new things. So I think when I travel, that's what I like to do, just check new things out. If I could make a living doing that, that would be great. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. One of my trips? Okay, well, let's see. The last trip I took... Let me think of one more exciting trip. Well, my family is from Eastern Europe, so one of the trips I took with my parents when I was 14 was I went to Austria, Hungary, and Romania, and getting to see some of those old... I'd been a few times before, but it was when I was little, so I don't really have too much memory. Plus, I didn't really process things quite the same as when I was kind of more of age. So I got to see my family's old hometown. We have a family tomb, so I got to see that. Then just these old buildings and just a different way of life. I really like that, seeing my parents' old friends. So that was pretty fun. It was very different. It was really my first time being taken away from my home environment. I left them all the school year, so it was just like going from suburban America to traveling around, taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old hundreds of year old towns. I don't know if it was for everyone. I don't know. It would be great for everybody, but I really enjoyed it. Awesome. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the Fishtank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? That's a good question. I probably one of the things I do is either turn on a rerun of a sitcom. I watch The Office a lot, so I kind of know when that's on. So I'll turn that on, just kind of zone out a little bit to familiar characters and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason. Or maybe eating some kind of comfort food. I try not to eat too much fast food at all, but in and out, I really like going there. So if I have to unwind once every few months, maybe I'll do that. Or I really like to read, especially like I'll read the day's events. That really relaxes me for some reason. Even if it's reading about some conflict going on somewhere in the world, I still read the headlines. I really like to know what's going on. That kind of centers me. So I really enjoy that. That's something I do to relax. How are you at controlling your temper? I would say I'm pretty great at it, although I think my nature makes it pretty easy. I don't get very upset easily at all. So it's not much of a challenge to control my temper. Yeah, I don't really have anger issues. It's difficult for me to get angry. So I don't really have much trouble with that at all. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? The last time I argued with somebody was probably...I don't even know. Small disagreements I might have had with family or friends about things. But just a full-on argument, I can't even remember. It's been years. I don't really argue too much. I try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my personal life. I don't really see anything to be gained by it. I naturally repel away from it. So I don't have much to say about arguing. What's something you feel guilty about? I say what you mean. Tell me about me then. I say what you mean. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I say what you mean. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. What's something you feel guilty about? I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was just...I was

just...I rammed into her old one and I was back to her old one and I was back to her old one and the確erboiaje월 later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job uh... allows me for to be pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh... i wish i could were like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up so one or two every night uh... and is just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or what not asleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i wish i were more uh... able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven and then sleep and wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later waking up later i'm pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health wise i feel good uh... you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh... uh... everything is great so far i i've absolutely no no real complaints uh... as far as i'm feeling on myself for anything like that no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that uh... everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing uh... kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort is this happened there is happening no no well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh... yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things uh... in my life uh... yeah like i said i i do regret uh... you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh... i hung out with a lot of friends yeah i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us work we just uh... you know we we got high every day uh... or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh... it was a kind of like a throwaway period of my life i would say that uh... it's important to to to engage with the world i think i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to uh... recognize the people around you for what they are you know what what kind of potential you know future activities that you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh... i would say also that uh... can try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that uh... that approach is kind of fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know uh... just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule life is in a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and uh... thinking that things will fall into place well i i guess when people i i don't especially uh... take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that at least for myself i sort of five things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh... group work that done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is kinda picked apart or scrutinized i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should uh... was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh... somebody with much less it was three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it and there was somebody just out of college you know uh... went over what we had done and you know just kinda rewording things and it seems just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of changing things and i can't take personal fence to that just uh... because i thought i had a lot more experience more education and uh... it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just uh... i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to necessarily redo all our work uh... or or even to uh... now not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh... uh... proofread i guess that to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know it was kind of like uh... an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but it wasn't our call most memorable experiences uh... well i guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my uh... the first real trip i took by myself uh... i i took the uh... the amtrak to new mexico and i was out there exploring things uh... for about ten days on my own uh... so that was kind of the longest period of time up till that point and i was in my i was twenty three maybe at the time that i had had really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time uh... it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh... you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions uh... and it was a lot of fun uh... uh... why been very happy recently i mean for that i'm getting married in a few months i got engaged on labor day uh... in two thousand twelve thanks so i was uh... that was a very happy day this this whole process you know uh... meeting someone and we we kind of progressed very quickly realize where we recognize where we were so i've been a pretty happy state the past uh... well it's been eleven months now but uh... yes so i think that the day we got engaged and we we shared with our family i think those have been very happy times uh... new years was happy you know i've been a happy period of my life right now so yeah thank you uh... with the sort of uh... sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh... also uh... you know

         "I've been feeling incredibly down, like a heavy cloud is constantly over me. It's more than just sadness; it's a profound lack of joy, even in things I used to love. I often feel numb, but then overwhelming sadness can hit me. There's a lot of guilt too, for not being able to just 'snap out of it' or be there for my loved ones. Sometimes I feel completely hopeless about things ever getting better, and I can be quite irritable.\n\nThis feeling has really impacted my daily life. My sleep is a mess – I struggle to fall asleep, wake up early, and still feel exhausted. My appetite changes; sometimes I eat too much, other times nothing at all, and food just doesn't taste good. I have zero motivation for anything. It's incredibly hard to even get out of bed or do basic tasks like showering. I've withdrawn from friends and family, avoiding calls and cancelling plans because I feel like such a burden. My work is suffering because I can't focus, and I'm constantly tired.\n\nI find myself just lying in bed, staring at the ceiling a lot. I try to push through, but it truly feels like I'm walking through mud. This has been going on for months now; it started subtly a while ago and has just gotten worse.",

Too many people and too much traffic. I can't see your shoes. Driving and seeing new stuff. Last year I went to Sacramento from here and stayed out for like a month living in my VW bus with my wife. It was kind of cool. Camping. Just wanting to have fun. Something different. Art. No. A little bit. Probably doing what you're doing. I'm really interested in coming up with new ideas and stuff too. Awesome. Outgoing. I haven't been doing much to do relaxing lately but I like the beach. Good. I argued with my brother last night actually about him. Talking to me with more respect. As a person.

         " Nice, I have my hair. You see what you look like, you're like, oh my god, I look dumb. So this picture is not based on a real woman at all. No, they used, it's not based on an actual person. Okay, so when she's done, I'll just wait for a flash in our system. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I just created a talk with people and based them on my experience. I'm not a bear but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'd love to give you questions and insights. And since you're a baby, your interests are fully confirmed. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing okay. It's still morning, so. Where are you from originally? I'm from the East Coast, Massachusetts. Really? Yes. When did you move to LA? I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents. Pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter. How often do you go back to your hometown? I haven't been back there. The last time I was back there was three years ago for Christmas. How does it compare to LA? LA is very hustle and bustle. There's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in LA. In which back east, the East Coast, the thought pattern is a lot different. You know your neighbors, you're friendly to your neighbors and you're kind to anybody that you see in the street. So, yeah. How would you say it was a period that you feel alone? Well, since I was a kid, I was fairly young. At first it was rough. I was getting in trouble a little bit in school. But after all that surpassed, I did fine in high school and stuff and even took some college courses. Okay. What are some things you really like about LA? Well, I love the beach and I love the mountains. I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach. I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy. Nice. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? No, not at all. Why? Just not interested. I've been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger. Went to Ensenada. But other than that, I'm not interested in leaving the United States, especially with what's been going on lately overseas. Okay. What did you study in school? Actually, child psychology. And I was in the nursing program for a little bit. But I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out. What are you doing? That's right. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually amazing. What's your dream job? I don't have one. To be honest, I admire people that are doing the job that they love. I mean, like football players. They love playing football and they get paid all that money. How great is that? Do you consider yourself shy or outgoing? I'm pretty outgoing. When I meet somebody at first, I might be a little bit reserved because we all, when we meet somebody, pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not. But once I've decided that I like that person or whatever, I talk a lot. Sometimes when I'm doing things, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best they've got. What do you do to relax? I like watching movies. I used to like reading, but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great, so it's hard to get into a good book. How are you at control of your temper? Not good at times. I have some outbursts every once in a while. It depends on how angry I get. When was the last time you argued with someone? Yesterday. It was with my partner. Actually, to be honest, I don't remember what it was about. Sometimes people can have an ugly attitude, and I don't appreciate that. If I feel that I'm being disrespected or whichever, I'm going to stand up for myself. Do you have problems with your partner? At times, some people may be turned off of my personality because I'm very opinionated. I say what's on my mind. I do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature. But I won't be bullied, and I won't back down if I feel like I'm being challenged. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in with your partner. Last year, my mother died. I wish I handled that differently. Is it uncomfortable when you talk about it? It upsets me. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Let me see. I think I'm going to pass on that one too because that will upset me more. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That is terrible. Sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem, especially when you're done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day, you're tired. But staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like I get up and then I'm wide awake. I'll go out in the living room, turn on the TV, and watch TV. I think I'll get three to four hours sleep. Maybe because I do have a lot on my mind, thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and all this other stuff, so that's probably a big part of it. It's not difficult, it's just frustrating because when your mind goes on overtime mode, it just affects everything, your concentration, your sleep, your eating, everything. What are you like when you're grouchy? I'm a little grouchy, especially in the morning. I'm not a morning person. I like the nights, but I don't like the mornings. It's like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee. Other than that, I'm okay. How have you been feeling lately? Well, I've been depressed for quite some time, and I'm still having difficulty. After my mother died four months later, my uncle died. I had two deaths last year, so I'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together. Just recently, I've started pursuing interests that I used to do that I haven't done in a year because of what happened. Have you ever spent a day in the living room or the bathroom? I might get angry a little easier. I sleep a lot. I eat. I overeat. I get tired very easily because I don't get much sleep. Sometimes it's hard. It seems like I'm struggling to get through the day. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. I have a psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis. How long ago were you diagnosed? Oh, I was diagnosed quite some time ago. Probably 10 to 15 years ago. It's just something I've never gotten over. I don't know whether or not you can, so I've always taken the medicine. What kind of medicine did you take? I was arguing with everybody, my family, my friends, and stuff like that. I was feeling desperate and hopeless. I had attempted to take my own life years ago, which caused me to be hospitalized. Then they started treating me. I started seeing a therapist. Are you going to a therapist? Well, right now I'm not going to a therapist because my insurance, they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist. But I am working with a friend of mine who knows some avenues to go to seek help for a therapist. I don't know if that's really going to help me. It depends on what kind of therapist you get. Sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on, and you're thinking, my God, what good is this? The other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions, tools to help you deal with your emotions. What sort of changes have you noticed in your therapy? Like I said, I haven't been going to therapy recently, just psychiatry, just medication. There's been no changes, really. I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away. I was her caregiver. Even though a lot of times I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her, I still was a heck of a lot happier than I am now. How many of us in the last few years felt really happy? I would say when my son was born, years ago. Do you find it easy to be a parent? I'm not a parent anymore. He passed away. That was difficult as well. I'm sorry you're late. What would you say as a mother about telling you? I'm extremely organized, extremely reliable. My work loves me because I get everything done that I'm supposed to get done, but sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained. Those qualities are admirable in people that can keep their word and be responsible. Excuse me? Oh, I have lots of regrets. Things that I've done in the past I'm not too happy about. I met somebody once in my life that had that saying, and you see it on a bumper sticker, live to never regret. You can't go back and make changes. It's too late, so why dwell on the situation? Sometimes it's a lot easier said than done. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I'm not the advice kind of get person. I don't really give my friends any kind of advice. I find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway, so why bother? I just state my opinion. That's all. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Right now I'm on a diet because of my overeating. After my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive. I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot. Sleep, eat, sleep, eat. Now I'm kind of on a diet trying to lose this weight because it's very unhealthy for me. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I'm trying to think it's been a long time. Actually there's really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy. I haven't been to a movie in ages. I used to go out shopping all the time. I don't now. So it's been quite some time since I've been content and happy with who I am and what I'm doing in my life right now. Tell me how you spend your weekend. My weekends, like on Saturday I'm usually working. On Sunday is usually clean up day. Do your laundry, clean up the house, run some errands, go shopping for food. That kind of thing. If I was younger it would be fun to go out clubbing or whatever, but I'm too old for that now. What are you most proud of in your life? Really there's nothing that I can think of. There's nothing that I can be proud of. What are some things that you do that you can give me? A good comedy or whatever. I like to watch that. Sometimes my partner might do something stupid, which I like because I make fun of them. But that's it. Maybe go out for a walk on the beach. That's it. Okay. No problem. Thank you. Bye. Does somebody talk for her or is she just talking to me really? I'll actually explain to you how she works once we're finished up with the study. Okay. Can you actually take that headset off? Thank you.",

I was feeling desperate and hopeless at one point, and years ago, I even attempted to take my own life, which led to hospitalization and starting treatment. I was diagnosed with depression probably 10 to 15 years ago, and I've always taken medication prescribed by my psychiatrist. I'm not seeing a therapist right now because of insurance, but a friend is helping me look for options. I'm not sure if therapy will really help, as I've found some therapists just listen without offering tools. There haven't been any changes recently with just medication.\n\nMy daily functioning is significantly impacted. Getting a good night's sleep is terrible; I might fall asleep, but staying asleep is hard. I often wake up wide awake and only get three to four hours of sleep, probably because my mind goes into overtime, thinking about bills and work stress. This affects everything – my concentration, sleep, and eating. I sleep a lot and overeat, especially after my mom died, which has led to weight gain. I'm on a diet now to try and lose it.\n\nMy concentration level hasn't been great lately, making it hard to get into a good book. Sometimes it feels like I'm struggling just to get through the day. I used to enjoy going out shopping and to movies, but I don't anymore. I just try to keep my mind busy. Recently, I've started pursuing some interests I used to do, but haven't in a year. It's been a long time since I've felt content or happy with who I am or what I'm doing. There's really nothing I can think of that I'm proud of in my life. I also tend to argue with family and friends more easily. I wish I had handled things differently after my mother died, but it's too upsetting to talk about. My son also passed away, which was very difficult. I try to relax by watching movies or the fish tank screen saver, and sometimes walking on the beach.",

         " Okay. All right. Thanks. Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks. Hi. Yeah. Go ahead. Okay. I grew up in Wisconsin and I grew up in the Colorado for a bit and then I lived overseas for a little while and then I moved to California. I moved here at the end of June of last year, so I guess it's been eight months, something like that. Yeah. At the most, probably twice a year. Well, my hometown is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and farms. So the opposite of LA. Okay. It's a good question. I always wanted to live in California, but I had been living in the Central Coast and I just had been coming down to LA once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff. So yeah, things were changing. In Santa Cruz for me, the client I had who was really the main financial source I had, that relationship ended, so I was totally free to move and I thought, well, I guess I'll give LA a try and see what happens. So I gave it a shot and here I am. No, not at all. It's a very, very big city. I lived in Dublin in Ireland, which is also a big city, but European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy. Yeah, so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city and the people that are traveling and, well. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes, I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I love to travel. I love it. I lived in Ireland and I traveled. I was in Morocco and I was in Costa Rica. I love meeting new people, experiencing new cultures, and also not just seeing what's different, but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go. Sure. Well, I guess I'm trying to think which was my favorite. I mean, there's amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both, but Morocco was incredible. It was like 12 days and we went to three different locations. We went up in the Atlas Mountains, which are beautiful. Yeah, it's a really, really cool culture. It was fun. What was the most memorable experience? My trip to Ireland, I actually visited there, which is why I decided to move there. So my most memorable moment of that trip, I mean, there's probably dozens, but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being on a bus and leaving Dublin and going just down to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is. Everyone sees pictures of Ireland or you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous, but you actually get there and experience it. The pictures don't do it justice. It was incredible. Awesome. What did you study at school? I have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master's degree in women's studies. Are you still working on that? No, I use my English and psychology. I work in marketing communications. I actually do sales. So yeah, the psychology definitely comes into play and so does my, I guess my undergrad degree in English, but really I took that on and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I wasn't wanting to teach. What made you decide to do that? I guess I'm not clear on the question. Let's come back to that later. Okay. I love my job. You could almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? Wow. My dream job is being a motivational speaker and trainer and coach and traveling the world doing that and impacting people's lives and really contributing to people. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship is pretty good actually. I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who was sporadic. I saw her sporadically growing up. I lived, my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together. So I grew up and I consider them the family I grew up with. But I got in communication with my biological mother last May and we've been cleared things up and have been in communication since then. How did you feel in that moment? Well, I'm not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and not just the future but in the present moment with her. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I'm shy. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? To relax I do a number of things. I like to do yoga although I don't have the money for it right now. I love to dance. I love to read. I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions. That really recharges my battery actually. Probably more than anything else. I like to be with friends. I love art and trying new restaurants. Yeah, all those things are both relaxing. I guess they're relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life. How are you at controlling your hunger? Depends. If I'm driving, not very good but otherwise I'm pretty good at it. When was the last time you argued with someone? Last time I argued with somebody. Probably would have to be... Oh no, it was with the LA Times about the newspaper delivery. Yeah, that was the last time. Yeah, the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of. It didn't show up and I didn't realize that it wasn't there until I don't know, afternoon, I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after 10.30 in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place. For a service that would pay for it for every day. Yeah, I was really irritated. Then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me. I was angry with the LA Times, I was angry with the people who had forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me. Yeah, I was pretty frustrated. Oh wow, there are quite a few of those. Let me think about one. The other day I had a phone call and I'm in a coaching program and it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be, we have meetings every week, classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls because we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with someone who's not my coach and that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so in that moment it just seemed to me like, oh my god I have all these people I have to be accountable to and I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was I don't know. I wasn't angry I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and you know and I talked it out with her and we got through it but yeah I could have certainly just been okay with whatever was being asked of me at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother. The hardest decision wow there's been a few. I guess moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision. No it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging but the hardest decision was the first time that I moved away from my family. I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that was a pretty tough decision because at that point my family had been within an hour's drive of wherever I lived an hour, hour and a half and now they were going to be a 12 hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was challenging. Oh lots of things I loved Colorado. Colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor community in Colorado so there were a lot more people who were in my age group and were single that was another factor and were interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado just seemed like a really natural fit and then I found a job that I liked, the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and I chose to move. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? That was a totally unrelated question. Relatively easily it just depends on what time I go to sleep if I'm out and I don't get home until 11.30 then I go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired and I don't know how much better I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I've had some pretty anxiety ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those or if I stir from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily. Are they triggered by something? I'm moving out of the house that I live in right now where I take care of an elderly woman and I have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being, she's exhausting and utterly depressing. How hard is that? Living with her is pretty hard, it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again. Honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don't think I would have said yes to the situation. How have you been feeling lately? I'm like this, there's nothing I can there's no way out of the situation that I'm in no matter what I do it doesn't get any better I'm not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy. Have you been diagnosed with depression? How long ago were you diagnosed? What got you to see me out? Did you feel down? Do you still get a therapy now? I don't actually, no. Why did you stop? Well I originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed, we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and then I began therapy again later on it was in my early 30's and then we ended that because I'd moved to Ireland. Yeah I mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention I don't go into therapy thinking oh I'm going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that's ridiculous. I think you go into therapy to work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and work through that situation and come up with a strategy for not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy. Huh. Wow that's pretty sad. It was at least a year ago. No that's not true it was when I saw my biological mother which was last May. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities. I'm very strong. Very strong willed. I'm very supportive and loving and nurturing. I'm easy to be around. I'm intelligent and I'm... Yeah. Anything I regret. I don't think so. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? I don't think too seriously. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend some time at the beach. I spend some time with friends. Either going out a night to a movie or just going out to a club or a bar. Somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together. Maybe go dancing after. And Sundays I usually go to and then I have brunch with friends and yeah I go home and Sunday night I get ready for the next day. What are you most proud of in your life? I am most proud of a few things. I've moved to places that I wanted to move to. I've done things that have really spoken to me. And have meant something to my heart. Achieve those goals. I've done things that I've wanted to do. Move to Ireland and move to California. That's great. Okay I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Sure. Goodbye. Bye. Just a little bit of a survey. Finish up with a quick post survey.",

         "Lately, I've been feeling pretty crappy, like there's no way out of my current situation.

         " She'll ask you some stuff, but yeah, she can understand. So when she's done, she'll let you know. You can put the door up over here. Hopefully it'll work, but I'll try to... Sometimes my sister can talk to me. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me Feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Boston. Really? When did you move to LA? About 30 years ago. That's a long time. Yep. When do you go back to your hometown? Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Oh, I love living in LA. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. Why did you move to LA? Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. The beginning of the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? Broadcast journalism. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. Are you still working on that? Nope. Why? Well, it's kind of a long story but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just, once I had done that work, I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. Yeah. It could be tough to find a good job these days. Yep. What's your dream job? My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Nice. How hard is that? Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to. I don't travel so much right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like where I'm from. Uh huh. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday because I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international dateline. I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay where native dolphins live and swim. It's very isolated for the most part. I got to be there for a whole weekend pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins. They come and swim with you. It's amazing. It's just a beautiful, beautiful spot in the world. Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More shy. Why? Why? Hmm. That's a good question. Partly the first thing I think of is because I've always been that way. But maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach because I live close to the beach. So that's one of my favorite things to relax. Uh huh. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Um. I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations. But not at people directly. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. I don't know if I feel guilty about anything at the moment. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I'm not sure I have one at the moment. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That just makes me really mad. That sucks. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. You know, I didn't know that I could do it. I didn't, wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. Um. So that felt like a really difficult decision. But in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time, it was really difficult to do that. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment. So that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm great. But it's because I am worried. But you know, I'm also confident that things are going to work out. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either. Sort of like just a even keel. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Well, I got to go to my friend's work at the Motion Picture Academy, so I get to see all the Oscar-nominated movies. She was there one night, so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again. So that was very pleasant. Nice. How would your best friend describe you? I think they would say reliable and loyal and considerate and thoughtful. Is there anything you regret? No. I really worked hard on that. I think there are lots of things maybe I would do differently, but there's nothing that really I regret. Like what? Well, I just think that there are things that... Like it's not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret. So I don't have a lot of regrets about things. Okay. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? That's a good question. Don't worry about the small stuff and save more money. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Well, you know, the normal things. Like I'd lose more weight and I would... I think be a little more fearless maybe. Be a little more bold. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. I don't think I have any of those. Okay. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Well, I am self-employed so I work all the time. So my ideal weekend is having lots of clients. That's something I enjoy. So that would be ideal at this point, my weekends, if I were really busy. What are you most proud of in your life? That I've really been able to take care of myself. And that, you know, I've done pretty much everything that I've said that I wanted to do. I've done that and I don't have regrets about things. There's nothing really that feels undone in my life. Sure, there's plenty of things I still want to do. But I feel like I've done what I said I was going to do. That's great. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, that's not so great. Well, it's okay. Both my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother. I feel closer to my brother than my sister but they both live on the East Coast and I live in LA. And my sister has two girls so I feel very close to my nieces. Although we don't talk as much as we used to because they're teenagers. So they have other things on their mind. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Probably my teacher, the person I learned my holistic bodywork from. That's so good to hear. How close are you to them? What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? What would be a good mood? Usually being with my friends or going out to dinner or just spending time with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Okay. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. It worked again. So now I'm going to have you move over to the other computer. So you can do a quick post survey about your experience.",
         "She'll ask you some stuff, but yeah, she can understand. So when she's done, she'll let you know. You can put the door up over here. Hopefully it'll work, but I'll try to... Sometimes my sister can talk to me. Okay. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people, and would love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I grew up in Boston. Really? When did you move to LA? About 30 years ago. That's a long time. Yep. When do you go back to your hometown? Not too often. Maybe once a year, sometimes less. How does it compare to LA? Oh, I love living in LA. I don't ever want to live anywhere else. Why did you move to LA? Well, I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and that's part of it. Okay. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Very easy. Well, maybe somewhat easy. The beginning of the first few weeks was really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew. But after a few weeks, it was great. What did you study at school? Broadcast journalism. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, it's something I'd wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was 12 until I went to college was sort of in pursuit of that dream. Are you still working on that? Nope. Why? Well, it's kind of a long story but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just, once I had done that work, I realized that's not really what I wanted to do. It was too cutthroat of a business and it just really wasn't suited for me. It didn't make me happy. Yeah. It could be tough to find a good job these days. Yep. What's your dream job? My dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries. Nice. How hard is that? Well, the work itself is not very hard. I'm very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I used to. I don't travel so much right now. What do you enjoy about traveling? I love seeing different places and different things. I love going to places that are not like where I'm from. Uh huh. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. My favorite trip is I went to Australia for my 30th birthday because I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I crossed the international dateline. I went to this really small place up on the west coast of Australia called Sharks Bay where native dolphins live and swim. It's very isolated for the most part. I got to be there for a whole weekend pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins. They come and swim with you. It's amazing. It's just a beautiful, beautiful spot in the world. Awesome. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? More shy. Why? Hmm. That's a good question. Partly the first thing I think of is because I've always been that way. But maybe that's an excuse. I don't know. I just prefer to be quiet and I'd rather be with fewer people than lots of people. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV a lot. That's probably not the best alternative, but it is something I do. And I also walk on the beach because I live close to the beach. So that's one of my favorite things to relax. Uh huh. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. It depends on the situation, but most of the time I'm pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Um. I don't think I tend to argue with people. I think I just get mad about situations. But not at people directly. Okay. What's something you feel guilty about? Hmm. I don't know if I feel guilty about anything at the moment. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. I'm not sure I have one at the moment. Okay. What are some things that make you really mad? Noise. Other people's noise makes me really mad. I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not considerate about their neighbors. That just makes me really mad. That sucks. Yeah. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hmm. Well, the only one that comes to mind off the top of my head is when I bought my condo. It felt like a really hard decision at the time. You know, I didn't know that I could do it. I didn't, wasn't sure if I had the money to do it. Um. So that felt like a really difficult decision. But in hindsight, of course, it turned out to be a great decision. But at the time, it was really difficult to do that. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Pretty easy. I sleep pretty well. That's good. How have you been feeling lately? For the most part, good. I'm just really worried about money at the moment. So that's my biggest. So I can't say that I'm great. But it's because I am worried. But you know, I'm also confident that things are going to work out. That's good. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? Nope. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. I don't know. I can't remember. I mean, I don't feel super happy all the time, but I don't feel unhappy either.

         " Okay. All right. Thank you. Hi, I'm Ellie. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people and I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions and I'll answer them. And please feel free to comment below and your answers are really comforting. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm feeling okay. I'm a little bit tired but for the most part, I'm feeling pretty good. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm actually originally from Woodland Hills, which is out in the San Fernando Valley. I was born there. And then I moved to Lomita, which is in Los Angeles County, about probably around 1993. So, I'm 23 now. So, it's about what, 19 years or so I've been living there. What are some things you really like about LA? Some things that I really like, I would have to say, you know, the beach. You know, not so much the traffic. I don't really care for that. But definitely, you know, just kind of like the nightlife. You know, just people in general. I like conversing with others. So, yeah. I see what you mean. Right. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Yeah, actually I do. I mean, I can't see your shoes. But yeah, actually I do travel a lot. I've been to places like Hawaii. I've been to the Caribbean. I've been to, let's see, you know, just different places like Arizona. I've been to Oregon, Washington. Pretty much all over, I would say. But usually mainly like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico as well. What do you enjoy about traveling? I think it's just the experience, you know. Like you can kind of experience the culture, different people, you know. Just the whole background, the scenery. It's just, you know, it's something new to experience, I would say. Something that, you know, people haven't seen before. And what's your favorite part of your trips? Well, let's see. I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago. That was back in December. It was around Christmas time, New Year's. So that was pretty fun. We went to a couple different islands. We went to, let's see, I think it was Kauai. We went to Oahu, Maui, you know, places like that. Nice. What's one thing you're most memorable seeing? You know, I would have to say that, you know, probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean. You know, just like I said before, the whole experience factor. Just seeing, you know, new, different things. Things that are unique. What did you study at school? I actually study journalism right now. In my final semester. So I'm about to graduate. A couple months. That's great. How did you decide to do that? Well, you know, it's kind of funny because, you know, I started off at a, you know, a two-year community college. And so, you know, I was going into like business management. Something to do with, you know, I think basically accounting. But, you know, I kind of figured that wasn't for me. So I decided to go into journalism because I couldn't, I mean, you know, I'd probably still be sitting at a desk. But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. I would almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. So. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. You know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back. Other times I kind of, it's not so much like I go into my shell, but, you know, at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't, I've never met them before. So it's one of those things that kind of, yeah, kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because, you know, I can neither be talk, very talkative or at times, you know, I can be a little bit shy. But, you know, once I get the conversation going, I'm fairly talkative. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? You know, usually I would listen to music or, you know, maybe just, you know, kind of go for a drive or, you know, hang out with my friends. You know, just something to just to kind of, you know, ease that, you know, because, you know, like I said, sometimes you get a little bit tense and you just want to relax and, you know, just do the things that you enjoy. So. How are you at controlling your temper? You know, I've actually been better with that. A couple years back, you know, there was points where like I pretty much couldn't control my temper, like whatsoever. I mean, I would just pretty much get angry. You know, the littlest things, everything would just kind of tick me off. But, you know, I've I've definitely learned to, you know, control that sort of thing. And, you know, it's made me a better person because of it. Well, let's see. I'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family, with my mother. Maybe it's I can't remember off the top of my head. But, you know, it's it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it. But, you know, eventually we make up and I apologize for it because, you know, I accept that, you know, I'm wrong in certain circumstances. You know. What's something you feel guilty about? Something that I feel guilty about? Probably, you know, not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past. You know, I mean, that is the past and, you know, I don't like to dwell on that sort of thing. But I think that's one thing that I've tried to work on. But it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing. Just being just being nice. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I ever had to make. Pretty recent. Kind of tough because I actually have a buddy. He was in the Air Force and he recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So that was really tough. And it's hard for me to talk to him because, you know, he's not really all there anymore like he used to be. So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that. But at the same time, I don't know his tendencies. He could be a little, you know, crazy. So probably like, you know, some sort of like traumatic stress disorder. Maybe when he was in the military. So I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's pretty tough, you know, because we go way back. I've been best friends with him since I was probably about five, six years old. So it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to deal with. But, you know, I try to, I don't, you know, try to keep in the back of my mind. But, you know, it's always there. I don't ever forget. So, yeah. Okay. How are your best friends friends with you? My best friend? Well, he'd probably say that, you know, I'm a pretty down to earth guy. Usually pretty honest. Sometimes brutally honest. But, you know, I try to work on that too. He'd probably say that I'm pretty funny. I like to hang out, you know, just kind of do things here and there, you know. Just normal activities like any other person. You know, go to the beach, hang out, watch movies, you know, grab a few beers, that sort of deal. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? You know, it varies. Sometimes it's easier than others. You know, if I'm really tired, you know, I'll probably have a very good sleep. I haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days because, you know, my house, there's workers on the roof. So you're putting in the new roofing. So that's kind of tough. So that always wakes me up early in the morning. So sometimes a little bit crabby. But for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep. Okay. How have you been doing lately? Lately, eh, I've been feeling pretty good, you know, because, you know, things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago for, you know, my field of journalism. So that's good. About to graduate in two months. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money. That's, you know, that's good. And, yeah, things are just going pretty well right now. I can't complain. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it's not bad. You know, like I said, it could always be worse, right? But, you know, I'm enjoying life. So that's the best part. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Did it feel down? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy? Man. You know, it was probably going back to my buddy when, you know, he was still, still had his sanity, I guess you could say. You know, he came back to visit from the Air Force. He had some leave. So, you know, we were just hanging out, you know, just kicking back, having a few beers and just talking about life. So that was nice. But I missed that, you know, so. How did you feel when that happened? I felt great, you know, because there's nothing like having a best friend. You can have conversation, you know, 24-7 about anything. You can tell anything to him in confidence. You can tell me anything in confidence. Like, it's hard to find, you know, especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now. So, yeah. Is there anything you regret? Yeah, there's probably one or two things that I regret. Well, I mean, I got a DUI about three or four years ago. Actually, it was four years ago. So that's something that I definitely regret because, you know, I look back on it and, you know, things might have been different. But at the same time, you have to accept, you know, the actions, you know, circumstances that took place. So, you know, I'm manned up and, you know, I guess I think I'm better off for it. But at the same time, you know, it's always going to be in the back of my mind, like I said. It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I usually keep it pretty generic. I tend to hang out with my friends. Either, you know, we hang out in the day, you know, do certain things like, you know, maybe grab a few beers, you know, just have casual conversation, maybe play games, watch movies, you know, just the standard stuff that people do. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Some things that I wish I could change? Probably just, you know, being nicer, like I said before. Maybe not being as lazy, have more determination. I mean, I have quite a bit of determination. I know what I want to do with my life. But I know there are times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical. So I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Well, you know, it's tough to think back. But I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is, you know, I would say probably like when I was, you know, kind of getting angry at certain people, maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have. I was trying to give more constructive criticism, but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things. And they were out of character, so. Okay. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities, I would say that I'm definitely hardworking. I'm determined. I'm very caring now, more than I used to be. Very honest. And, you know, I just, I love to talk to people. Like I like making new relationships. I like making people laugh. That's good. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something that I did recently that I really enjoyed? You know, it was probably over at my internship. I was just, you know, I wrote a story or two. And it just felt good, you know, to get those stories done. And eventually they're going to go into the paper. So I feel accomplished about that. You know, it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there. You know, it's right in your face. And you can tell yourself, you know, like I did that. So it makes me feel good. Yep. What was it about? You know, just let's see. A few different stories. Just usually things about, well, the paper's in Long Beach. So it's usually about, you know, stories or events that are taking place in Long Beach. So, yeah. What are you most proud of in life? I would say that I'm most proud of, you know, graduating high school, about to graduate college. Hopefully, you know, obviously I'm going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job, you know, in the near future. I think that's one thing that I'm most proud of. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay. I'm going to move back to the computer. I'm going to shut all the recording down. And just going to have you fill out a quick post survey about your experience. So we really value your feedback. So we really ask that you take care of your answers.",

But, you know, at least with journalism, I can go out in the field and, you know, talk to people and, you know, kind of, you know, receive information, gather information, that sort of deal. And then, you know, write up stories. I just thought it was, you know, it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to, you know, just kind of crunchy numbers all day. So, yep. I love my job. I would almost say it's virtually made for me. What's your dream job? My dream job, I would have to say, you know, something in maybe radio broadcasting, sports broadcasting. You know, I think that would be really interesting, something that's definitely a passion of mine. So. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, it's pretty good. You know, I live with my parents still. Like I said, I'm 23 years old. You know, there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky, a little bit rocky. But for the most part, it's pretty good. You know, I've matured a lot in the last few years. So things are, you know, getting back up to speed, I would say. Things are going pretty well. That's good. Do you consider yourself in shy or outgoing? You know, I think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle. You know, sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative to people when I'm relaxed and laid back. Other times I kind of, it's not so much like I go into my shell, but, you know, at times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't, I've never met them before. So it's one of those things that kind of, yeah, kind of got to meet me in the middle with it because, you know, I can neither be very talkative or at times, you know, I can be a little bit shy. But, you know, once I get the conversation going, I'm fairly talkative. So. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? You know, usually I would listen to music or, you know, maybe just, you know, kind of go for a drive or, you know, hang out with my friends. You know, just something to just to kind of, you know, ease that, you know, because, you know, like I said, sometimes you get a little bit tense and you just want to relax and, you know, just do the things that you enjoy. So. How are you at controlling your temper? You know, I've definitely learned to, you know, control that sort of thing. And, you know, it's made me a better person because of it. Well, let's see. I'm trying to think it was probably something with my family, with my mother. Maybe I can't remember off the top of my head. But, you know, it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it. But, you know, eventually we make up and I apologize for it because, you know, I accept that, you know, I'm wrong in certain circumstances. You know. What's something you feel guilty about? Something that I feel guilty about? Probably, you know, not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past. You know, I mean, that is the past and, you know, I don't like to dwell on that sort of thing. But I think that's one thing that I've tried to work on. But it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing. Just being nice. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision I ever had to make. Pretty recent. Kind of tough because I actually have a buddy. He was in the Air Force and he recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. So that was really tough. And it's hard for me to talk to him because, you know, he's not really all there anymore like he used to be. So it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that. But at the same time, I don't know his tendencies. He could be a little, you know, crazy. So probably like, you know, some sort of like traumatic stress disorder. Maybe when he was in the military. So I don't know. But yeah. Yeah. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it's pretty tough, you know, because we go way back. I've been best friends with him since I was probably about five, six years old. So it's just, yeah, it's just really hard to deal with. But, you know, I try to keep in the back of my mind. But, you know, it's always there. I don't ever forget. So, yeah. Okay. How are your best friends friends with you? My best friend? Well, he'd probably say that, you know, I'm a pretty down to earth guy. Usually pretty honest. Sometimes brutally honest. But, you know, I try to work on that too. He'd probably say that I'm pretty funny. I like to hang out, you know, just kind of do things here and there, you know. Just normal activities like any other person. You know, go to the beach, hang out, watch movies, you know, grab a few beers, that sort of deal. Yeah. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? You know, it varies. Sometimes it's easier than others. You know, if I'm really tired, you know, I'll probably have a very good sleep. I haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days because, you know, my house, there's workers on the roof. So you're putting in the new roofing. So that's kind of tough. So that always wakes me up early in the morning. So sometimes a little bit crabby. But for the most part, I usually get a pretty good sleep. Okay. How have you been doing lately? Lately, eh, I've been feeling pretty good, you know, because, you know, things are starting to look up. I actually got an internship about a month ago for, you know, my field of journalism. So that's good. About to graduate in two months. So I'm looking forward to that. I'm starting to make a little bit more money. That's, you know, that's good. And, yeah, things are just going pretty well right now. I can't complain. That sounds like a great situation. Yeah, it's not bad. You know, like I said, it could always be worse, right? But, you know, I'm enjoying life. So that's the best part. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? I have not, no. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Did it feel down? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Last time I felt really happy? Man. You know, it was probably going back to my buddy when, you know, he still had his sanity, I guess you could say. You know, he came back to visit from the Air Force. He had some leave. So, you know, we were just hanging out, you know, just kicking back, having a few beers and just talking about life. So that was nice. But I missed that, you know, so. How did you feel when that happened? I felt great, you know, because there's nothing like having a best friend. You can have conversation, you know, 24-7 about anything. You can tell anything to him in confidence. You can tell me anything in confidence. Like, it's hard to find, you know, especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now. So, yeah. Is there anything you regret? Yeah, there's probably one or two things that I regret. Well, I mean, I got a DUI about three or four years ago. Actually, it was four years ago. So that's something that I definitely regret because, you know, I look back on it and, you know, things might have been different. But at the same time, you have to accept, you know, the actions, you know, circumstances that took place. So, you know, I'm manned up and, you know, I think I'm better off for it. But at the same time, you know, it's always going to be in the back of my mind, like I said. It's just one of those things you have to deal with in your own way. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I usually keep it pretty generic. I tend to hang out with my friends. Either, you know, we hang out in the day, you know, do certain things like, you know, maybe grab a few beers, you know, just have casual conversation, maybe play games, watch movies, you know, just the standard stuff that people do. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Some things that I wish I could change? Probably just, you know, being nicer, like I said before. Maybe not being as lazy, have more determination. I mean, I have quite a bit of determination. I know what I want to do with my life. But I know there are times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical. So I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Well, you know, it's tough to think back. But I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is, you know, I would say probably like when I was, you know, kind of getting angry at certain people, maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have. I was trying to give more constructive criticism, but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things. And they were out of character, so. Okay. What would you say are some of your best qualities? My best qualities, I would say that I'm definitely hardworking. I'm determined. I'm very caring now, more than I used to be. Very honest. And, you know, I just, I love to talk to people. Like I like making new relationships. I like making people laugh. That's good. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. Something that I did recently that I really enjoyed? You know, it was probably over at my internship. I was just, you know, I wrote a story or two. And it just felt good, you know, to get those stories done. And eventually they're going to go into the paper. So I feel accomplished about that. You know, it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there. You know, it's right in your face. And you can tell yourself, you know, like I did that. So it makes me feel good. Yep. What was it about? You know, just let's see. A few different stories. Just usually things about, well, the paper's in Long Beach. So it's usually about, you know, stories or events that are taking place in Long Beach. So, yeah. What are you most proud of in life? I would say that I'm most proud of, you know, graduating high school, about to graduate college. Hopefully, you know, obviously I'm going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job, you know, in the near future. I think that's one thing that I'm most proud of. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Okay. I'm going to move back to the computer. I'm going to shut all the recording down. And just going to have you fill out a quick post survey about your experience. So we really value your feedback. So we really ask that you take care of your answers.",
         "I haven't been diagnosed with depression, and I don't feel down. Lately, I've been feeling pretty good, especially with my new internship in journalism and graduating soon; things are looking up, and I'm enjoying life. I do feel some guilt about not always being as nice to others in the past, and I regret getting a DUI a few years ago, though I try not to dwell on those things. It's been really tough dealing with my best friend's recent diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia; it's hard to talk to him now, and I miss our conversations, which is something that's always in the back of my mind. My sleep has been a bit affected in the last few days, but that's due to roof workers at my house waking me up early. Generally, I usually get a pretty good sleep.",

Um That's where i'm from Um Well There's a lot more that I don't like but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up.

I was working at a hot spring resort And I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry Um not hard you don't you don't even think about Difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't Um I guess uh Kind of what I described about this city. I just wanted to uh, get out of here and Kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal. Yeah Um, well currently i'm studying, um Currently i'm studying Physical therapy i'm about to become licensed massage therapist but before that yeah, kind of cool, but before that I was going to Um for music composition so I was just writing scores for films animations dance productions theater productions Stuff like that. Yeah, it was cool. It was fun trippy very trippy, um, but it was cool, but I had to leave that because tuition hikes Up to you know going up to like 50 000 a year for like a four-year bfa is uh Not not the deal. I'm not trying to trap myself with these chains of federal loans So yeah Hey, that's not a good word sucks Um dream job My dream job would be Anything That I can do to alleviate these uh metropolitan like cities from The nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare. My dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and With you know physical therapy and artistic expression. I've got some Great ideas Yeah Um I guess more outgoing.

I haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt. What about you? What's something you feel guilty about?

Not a fan of that. Not a fan not a fan to support that but um Yeah, that's probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don't support these crazy tuition hikes going around and um but another reason why I Decided to leave had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because um art institute, you know, that's a It's a funny idea in itself already and basically I was a musician Being taught by a musician to make music And same with you know, all the all the dancers or the theater students, you know getting taught dance To a dancer from a dancer how to dance, you know and it's just um Yeah, it's just not quite as artistic as I thought Art would be art Art comes from somewhere uh, somewhere sweet and deep and purple And not not from out there, you know, so yeah If I If I um It's kind of easy.

         "I've been feeling kind of like I'm cruising on a 'nice gray line,' which I actually find stable and comfortable, even if some people might not like it. I believe that everyone experiences depression, happiness, and anger, just on different days and in different ways, and I haven't been diagnosed by a medical professional.\n\nThe hectic and chaotic atmosphere of Los Angeles, with its car culture and constant 'grind,' isn't very supportive and can be overwhelming. To escape this, I love traveling to see the world as it truly is, away from the 'man-made image' of the city. I recently found a sense of 'relative sanity' in Los Banos, where I could breathe, hike, farm, and do carpentry without digital distractions, which was truly enjoyable.\n\nWhen my thoughts get overwhelming, it takes me a long time to remember to breathe and settle down for sleep. To relax and help with this, I make chamomile tea, practice breathing exercises, go through my mantras, and do 'pre-dream therapy work.' Sometimes, if I'm lucky, a nice indica helps me get drowsy. I recently felt guilty about how I handled leaving an apartment and a relationship, wishing I had been more thoughtful about it. My family is important to me; I'm very close with my mom and sister, and while communication with my dad needs work, I connect with him through his art.",

Okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? How long ago were you diagnosed? What got you to sleep out? Do you still get the therapy now? How is seeing a therapist affecting you? Well, basically I just got rid of them on my life because I didn't feel like they were really listening to me or anything. So I just didn't feel too much beneficial help from them, so I've been looking for alternative means. Like what? Well, basically like music and forcing myself to go to different social related events. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Yes. What were your symptoms? Depress. Basically just depressed, keeping myself locked in, not talking to anyone. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I guess a few days ago. Okay. Well, basically I feel that the best way to keep people in my life is having fake people in my life by playing online multiplayer games with avatars and usernames and everything.

Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. Okay. Well, my ideal weekend. Let me see.

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing pretty well. I have some stressful circumstances going on, but right now I'm engaged. That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Minnesota. Really? Mm-hmm. When did you move to LA? 31 years ago. That's a long time. Half my life. How often do you go back to your hometown? Frequently I've been back there quite a bit, but over the years not that often. How does it compare to LA? Well, it's a whole different experience. I go back there to see my family and old friends. LA is home. It's nice to return here. That's good. Why did you move to LA? To be an actor. Are you still doing that? I'm just actually getting around to it. I was in another business for 25 years, and now finally I can't put it off anymore. What made you decide to do that? The economy. It's easy to find work in show business, it seems, as it is any of the other jobs I've done in the past. Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? A whole variety of things, but mostly having to do with theater. What's your dream job? To be a successful actor would be nice. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. With elements of shyness. I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Well, I read and I cook. That's about it. I'm a big radio listener to talk radio, national public radio, and more not crazy stuff. Sensible listening, nice content, interesting human interest. Like what? Oh, well I'm also a comedian, and so I like to listen to radio shows that have comedy. How are you at controlling yourself? I'm pretty good. I mean, I'm not perfect. I can get very upset. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Oh, probably with my wife about my methods of job hunting and like that. How hard is that? It's difficult. We're very different and have very different MOs. For me to do things my way is not always easy. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. Well, just the other night I was performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to introduce myself to a very famous person and I didn't do it. Why? I'm not sure. I guess I didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him. I miss him. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I can't think of one. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I've been married for 24 years in July, which is a couple of months. My wife and I have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years. We have a very high achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school this spring. She's just gotten accepted at a college that she wants to go to with a very nice scholarship. That's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Yeah. Well, my daughter's been very low maintenance for me, perhaps more so for my wife, but she's always been an excellent child. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Well, we're more similar, I think, than different. I'm much more aware of what's happening in the world and much more informed than my parents were. But in terms of child rearing, I think we've all been kind of hands-off. My wife has been more hands-on. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Well, the financial responsibility. I think it's wanting to make sure that your child has everything that her peers have and not wanting her to not have the same as her friends. And she has very wealthy friends. I am not a gifted moneymaker. It's a struggle, but we keep up. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. That sort of put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that were kind of dictated by my upbringing. Like what? Oh, just instead of working for somebody else, being able to start a business and be in business for yourself and to not be dependent on just one source of income. Okay. Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Oh. Meeting one particular woman when I first got out here. Tell me about that. She left me less than healthy physically. I self-medicate to go to sleep, which I probably don't have to do, but about half the nights I wake up much earlier than I would like to. Why? Oh, mostly to have to go to the bathroom. Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Well, I cope pretty well. I guess I'm just not quite as functional as I'd like to be. There are a couple of nights a week when I work until two o'clock in the morning and don't get to bed until three. Normally I need seven hours if I only get five or six and I'm sluggish. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Very anxious. Can you tell me about that? Well, I have big bills to pay and not a lot of income coming in. That sounds really high. Yeah, it's because I don't like to fall behind. I feel like I'm worried about losing ground and the stakes are high. It's an uncomfortable position. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I am a classic depressive. Yeah, I guess I have. I do see a therapist. Though the therapist I'm seeing now is not trying to prescribe drugs or medications. Previous ones have. How long ago were you diagnosed? Probably six years ago. What got you into seeing help? Well, my wife kind of pushed me into it. She thought it was a way of, I think, getting help finding work. It's not. It's just I enjoyed having someone to talk to. Not really. What were your symptoms? I was just having a lot of trouble with the struggle. Displeasure with my life. Do you still have a therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Their what? Do you feel like therapy is useful? I don't understand that word. Have you noticed anything on your head? Well, I... It's something I look forward to because I feel like I'm talking to someone who understands me. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I can't. I don't know. Each little acting gig that I get makes me happy, but just mildly happy. They usually turn out to be disappointing experiences. I'm never over-excited with happiness. Tell me about something you've been doing that you really enjoy. Yesterday I made a dessert to celebrate my daughter's scholarship. It was delicious and we really enjoyed that. That's so good to hear. Is there anything you're about? No. Except meeting that one woman. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Probably try a little harder. I had started this business around that time. It was difficult, but we were successful at it. I guess I could have gotten it rolling even more so that it wouldn't be so dead today. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. What are you most proud of about your mother? I'm going for the big apple. I hope to be successful there too. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.",

That's good. Where are you from originally? I'm from Minnesota. Really? Mm-hmm. When did you move to LA? 31 years ago. That's a long time. Half my life. How often do you go back to your hometown? Frequently I've been back there quite a bit, but over the years not that often. How does it compare to LA? Well, it's a whole different experience. I go back there to see my family and old friends. LA is home. It's nice to return here. That's good. Why did you move to LA? To be an actor. Are you still doing that? I'm just actually getting around to it. I was in another business for 25 years, and now finally I can't put it off anymore. What made you decide to do that? The economy. It's easy to find work in show business, it seems, as it is any of the other jobs I've done in the past. Yeah. I see what you mean. What did you study at school? A whole variety of things, but mostly having to do with theater. What's your dream job? To be a successful actor would be nice. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Outgoing. With elements of shyness. I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? Well, I read and I cook. That's about it. I'm a big radio listener to talk radio, national public radio, and more not crazy stuff. Sensible listening, nice content, interesting human interest. Like what? Oh, well I'm also a comedian, and so I like to listen to radio shows that have comedy. How are you at controlling yourself? I'm pretty good. I mean, I'm not perfect. I can get very upset. When was the last time you argued with someone? What was it about? Oh, probably with my wife about my methods of job hunting and like that. How hard is that? It's difficult. We're very different and have very different MOs. For me to do things my way is not always easy. Tell me about a situation that you wish you were in a different way. Well, just the other night I was performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to introduce myself to a very famous person and I didn't do it. Why? I'm not sure. I guess I didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him. I miss him. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I can't think of one. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Well, I've been married for 24 years in July, which is a couple of months. My wife and I have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years. We have a very high achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school this spring. She's just gotten accepted at a college that she wants to go to with a very nice scholarship. That's great. Do you find it easy to be a parent? Yeah. Well, my daughter's been very low maintenance for me, perhaps more so for my wife, but she's always been an excellent child. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? Well, we're more similar, I think, than different. I'm much more aware of what's happening in the world and much more informed than my parents were. But in terms of child rearing, I think we've all been kind of hands-off. My wife has been more hands-on. What's the hardest thing about being a parent? Well, the financial responsibility. I think it's wanting to make sure that your child has everything that her peers have and not wanting her to not have the same as her friends. And she has very wealthy friends. I am not a gifted moneymaker. It's a struggle, but we keep up. There's someone that's been a positive influence in your life. That sort of put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that were kind of dictated by my upbringing. Like what? Oh, just instead of working for somebody else, being able to start a business and be in business for yourself and to not be dependent on just one source of income. Okay. Tell me about New York or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Oh. Meeting one particular woman when I first got out here. Tell me about that. She left me less than healthy physically. I self-medicate to go to sleep, which I probably don't have to do, but about half the nights I wake up much earlier than I would like to. Why? Oh, mostly to have to go to the bathroom. Okay. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Well, I cope pretty well. I guess I'm just not quite as functional as I'd like to be. There are a couple of nights a week when I work until two o'clock in the morning and don't get to bed until three. Normally I need seven hours if I only get five or six and I'm sluggish. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? Very anxious. Can you tell me about that? Well, I have big bills to pay and not a lot of income coming in. That sounds really high. Yeah, it's because I don't like to fall behind. I feel like I'm worried about losing ground and the stakes are high. It's an uncomfortable position. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? I am a classic depressive. Yeah, I guess I have. I do see a therapist. Though the therapist I'm seeing now is not trying to prescribe drugs or medications. Previous ones have. How long ago were you diagnosed? Probably six years ago. What got you into seeing help? Well, my wife kind of pushed me into it. She thought it was a way of, I think, getting help finding work. It's not. It's just I enjoyed having someone to talk to. Not really. What were your symptoms? I was just having a lot of trouble with the struggle. Displeasure with my life. Do you still have a therapy now? Yes. Do you feel like therapy is useful? Their what? Do you feel like therapy is useful? I don't understand that word. Well, I... It's something I look forward to because I feel like I'm talking to someone who understands me. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. I can't. I don't know. Each little acting gig that I get makes me happy, but just mildly happy. They usually turn out to be disappointing experiences. I'm never over-excited with happiness. Tell me about something you've been doing that you really enjoy. Yesterday I made a dessert to celebrate my daughter's scholarship. It was delicious and we really enjoyed that. That's so good to hear. Is there anything you're about? No. Except meeting that one woman. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Probably try a little harder. I had started this business around that time. It was difficult, but we were successful at it. I guess I could have gotten it rolling even more so that it wouldn't be so dead today. What are you most proud of about your mother? I'm going for the big apple. I hope to be successful there too. That's good. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. You're welcome. Goodbye.",
         "I've been diagnosed as a classic depressive, probably about six years ago. My wife really encouraged me to seek help, initially thinking it would assist with finding work, but for me, it's more about having someone to talk to who understands me.\n\nLately, I've been feeling very anxious, primarily because of significant financial pressures – I have big bills and not a lot of income. This makes me constantly worried about losing ground, and it's a very uncomfortable position to be in.\n\nWhen I was first diagnosed, my main symptoms were a lot of trouble with the struggle and a general displeasure with my life. This feeling persists; I can't really recall the last time I felt truly happy. Even small acting gigs, while mildly enjoyable, usually end up being disappointing, and I'm never over-excited with happiness.\n\nMy sleep is often affected; I self-medicate to fall asleep, and about half the nights I wake up much earlier than I'd like. If I don't get my usual seven hours, I feel sluggish and not as functional as I'd like to be, though I generally cope pretty well.\n\nBeyond the financial strain, I've also been sleeping separately from my wife for about three years. In terms of coping, I find listening to talk radio, reading, and cooking helpful for relaxation, and therapy is something I look forward to because it provides a space to talk to someone who gets it.",

I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Kind of down. Why? I don't have a boyfriend. Don't have money. I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you from originally? Florida. Really? Yep. What did you do in LA? I tried to find work. How often do you go back to your hometown? About once a year. That's good. How does it compare to LA? More boring. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? Not easy. Can you tell me about that? It's hard when you don't have enough money to get your own place, so I have to live with roommates. What are some things you really like about LA? The weather. The scenery. What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. It's too expensive to have your own place by your own. I see what you mean. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I want to. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different places, different cultures, the buildings, the food and stuff. I'd love to hear about all your trips. I drove from Florida over here. I drove to the South. I went to Alabama. People are nicer in Louisiana. People are really nice. Then Mississippi, then Texas, then Arizona, then California. I got to see the country a little bit. Awesome. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess traveling through the country. I went to Louisiana. People are really nice in a small town called Jennings. People are always happy and fun. That's great. What did you study at school? I just went to high school. That was the basic stuff. What's your dream job? I don't know. My dream job? I'm an interior designer to the stars. Really? Yep. Why? Because they have enough money to get the furniture and I get to keep the free furniture too. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? Upgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I watch TV, funny TV shows. Like what? Sometimes Big Bang Theory or sometimes a funny movie on TV. Nice. How are you at controlling your temper? Pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? Where I used to live about two weeks ago, I had to move out. I moved in there and he told me that he didn't have any marijuana or marijuana plants because he didn't want to be around. He had that so I had to move out because he had a self-in-living room. Yeah, it does. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and him would handle differently. I don't know. Good question. Probably... Probably, I don't know, probably with an ex-boyfriend. We broke up. Okay. Can you tell me about that? Yeah, it's in the past. I'm over him. He was a jerk anyway. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. Hardest decision? Leaving home? Tell me about that. Well, I could try a better life out here in California but I miss home. Yeah, I'm sorry. Isn't it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yep. Okay. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? My roommates don't have the TV on now. It's pretty good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Tired. I'm lazier during the day. Uh-huh. How have you been feeling lately? Frustrated. Why? I'm poor. I don't want to be. I see. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No, just more sad. Have you been diagnosed with depression? Nope. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Wow. Um... It's been a while. It's been like, god, more over two years. Can you tell me about that? Um, I didn't have any money problems. I was doing fine. Um, yep. What was something you did recently that you really enjoyed? Oh, what did I do? Um, I was with my cats at home here in California and they're playing outside. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. My ideal weekend would be nice. Um, at the beach eating at a nice restaurant. Is there anything you regret? No. Not. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't spend so much money. You'll need it in the future. Have you done anything to avoid it? Yeah. Save money. Okay. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, my bank account. How would your best friend describe you? Um, it's a nice person. You were very young, weren't you? And what? What? What are you most proud of in your life? Um, um, I'm gonna push that out now. Um, I persevere. Tell me about your relationship with your family. Yeah, I'd rather not. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? Uh, me a few years ago. I was more like a mentor and um, taught me some things. Like what? Never complain. Be thankful for everything you have. What would you say are some of your best qualities? Um, my eyes? People say I have pretty eyes. Um, like a dress up. What are some things you like to do for fun? For fun? I like to try surfing. Go shopping. Maybe go to art galleries. That's good. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye! Bye!

Are you still working on that? No. What's your dream job? To be a writer. Can you tell me about that? I like being able to write what I want to write. Right now I write things that I'm not really that interested in. Like what? Like articles about teenager culture, stuff like that. What do you think of today's kids? I think they have it pretty easy.

Depends on the situation or who I'm around. When I first meet people I can be shy. But if it's someone I've known for a while I can be outgoing. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense I turn on the fish tank screensaver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I'll lay down or try some sort of deep breathing or just maybe do something that's kind of fun and mind numbing like watch TV. How are you at controlling your temper? I'm pretty good. I don't really let anger show that much. I don't have a fiery temper or anything like that. I'm pretty rational. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I actually can't remember when the last time I argued with someone was because it's been so long. Wow. What's something you feel guilty about? I guess I feel guilty about the fact that I don't talk to my grandparents as much as I should. Okay. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I'm close with my grandparents, but not really anyone else in my family. Why? Because they basically sort of raised me and my parents weren't really in the picture that much. I understand. Tell me about a situation that you wish you and them would different me. I can't really think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about me that or something that you wish you could erase from the memory. I guess when my sister died it was really traumatizing. I'm sorry. Is it uncomfortable for you to talk about this? Yeah. Yes. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not really super easy. I sort of, I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh, last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends describing you? Probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh, no. I don't think. There's not, I don't think, I think regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't try to, don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, sometimes, sometimes I can be kind of lazy. Uh, I'd like to have more of a, um, like sort of a better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh, just sort of putting off stuff until, you know, right when it's due or after it's due, things like that. Um, procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh, sometimes for the things that I write, uh, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I guess I'm most proud of the fact that, uh, I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, just hanging out with my friends, uh, sort of people watching, watching a movie that's good, um, listening to music. Okay.

I guess the hardest decision I've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband. What made you decide to do that? Because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married, but I still felt like I should stick it out. How hard is that? I mean it was hard at the time, but I made the right decision I think. Okay. Who's someone that's been a positive influence in your life? My grandmother was a positive influence from a young age. Can you tell me about that? She's just a very strong, powerful, sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me. That's so good to hear. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Not really super easy. I sort of, I mean it's probably my fault I go to bed too late. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Just sort of foggy and distracted. I have trouble concentrating. Okay. How have you been feeling lately? You mean like my body? Mm-hmm. Normal. Fine. No complaints. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? No. It's been the same as ever. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Uh, last night I was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff. That's great. How are your best friends describing you? Probably funny and easy to get along with but also caring. Tell me how you spend your ideal weekend. I spend my ideal weekend not really doing much. Like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies, watching TV. Is there anything you regret? Uh, no. I don't think. There's not. I think regretting things is a waste of time. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? Um, don't go out of your way to try and impress people. If they like you then they like you. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? Um, sometimes I can be kind of lazy. Uh, I'd like to have more of a, um, like sort of a better work ethic I guess. Can you give me an example of that? Uh, just sort of putting off stuff until, you know, right when it's due or after it's due, things like that. Um, procrastinating. Okay. Tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad about yourself. Uh, sometimes for the things that I write, uh, people will write negative things about me like in the comments section on a website. That'll make me feel bad. That sucks. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I'm articulate and funny and a good friend. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I guess I'm most proud of the fact that, uh, I am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world. I'm proud of the fact that I feel comfortable with it. That's so good to hear. What are some things that usually put you in a good mood? Um, just hanging out with my friends, uh, sort of people watching, watching a movie that's good, um, listening to music. Okay. I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Bye. Bye.",
         "I sometimes feel guilty about not talking to my grandparents as much as I should. Getting a good night's sleep isn't super easy for me; I often go to bed too late, which leaves me feeling foggy, distracted, and having trouble concentrating the next day. I can also be kind of lazy and procrastinate, often putting things off until they're due or even after, and I wish I had a better work ethic. My current writing work isn't really that interesting to me, as I'd prefer to write what I want. Sometimes, when people write negative comments about my work online, it makes me feel bad. To relax or when I'm feeling tense, I'll lay down, try some deep breathing, or do something mind-numbing like watching TV, or even turn on a fish tank screensaver. Hanging out with my friends, watching good movies, or listening to music usually puts me in a good mood. My grandparents basically raised me, and I'm close with them, as well as my friends, who describe me as funny, easy to get along with, and caring. I feel satisfied with myself and my place in the world. These feelings and behaviors aren't new; they've been the same as ever, and I haven't been diagnosed with depression.",

         " Okay. Great. Thanks. Hi, I'm Ali. Thanks for coming in today. I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment. I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and I'd love to learn about you. I'll ask a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine. That's good. Where are you from originally? California, here in Los Angeles.

What are some things you don't really like about LA? Traffic. Just so many, sometimes too many people. But apart from that, I'm generally happy here. Okay. What did you study at school? Photography and language studies. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? I love photography. I was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well. So I wanted to continue to learn more about it. And with languages, I come from a mixed background. So I wanted to learn languages of my ethnic background. How hard is that? It wasn't hard.

Awesome. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? I have. I love travel. What do you enjoy about traveling? Seeing different cultures, different countries, meeting new people. All of that. And the language. I lived in Greece for over a year. I taught English there. And moved around to different parts of Greece. And really had a great time. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I think just having my group of friends that I met there. And going through the experience with them. I think one of my most memorable experiences was going to Elefonisos in a car with everybody. And having just a fantastic time. That sounds like a great situation. Yes it was. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I think I'm shy to begin with. And as I get to know people that I'm much more outgoing. What do you study at school? Photography and language studies. Sometimes when I'm feeling tense, I turn on the fish tank screen saver. Hey, I know it's not Hawaii, but it's the best I've got. What do you do to relax? I just stay at home. Maybe watch a movie. Rest in bed. Watching a movie in bed. That's probably one of the things I like to do to relax. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? I think very good. That's good. When was the last time you argued with someone? And what was it about? It was probably with my boyfriend. Regarding money issues. What's something you feel guilty about? I feel guilty about not generating as much income as I need to right now. Can you tell me about that? I'm having some struggles in my career right now. Financially, it's becoming very difficult. I'm sorry. That sounds really hard. Yeah, it has been difficult. But I've been working very hard to remedy that. That's great. Can you give me an example of that? While I'm here, I'm doing this focus study. I'm doing many things to generate more money, working harder, but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my career. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Probably being raped. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Do you have disturbing thoughts? Sometimes. Are they triggered by something? Not that I'm aware of. How have you been feeling lately? I've been feeling stressed. I've been feeling stressed and worried. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? I don't seem to have any problem with it. I seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night. That's good. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Grumpy and lethargic in the morning. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Hmm. A situation I wish I would handle differently. I really can't think of one right now. Okay. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. The hardest decision I've ever had to make was probably deciding to not have a child. Can you tell me about that? Well, I was pregnant and wasn't sure whether or not I should continue the pregnancy. That was also due to financial burden. The father who I was involved with did not want the child. So I made that very, very difficult decision. Yeah. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Hmm. Really, really happy. I know. When I went to Cancun on a holiday over the New Year period. New Year holiday. How did you feel in that moment? I felt absolutely fantastic. I felt happy. I felt relaxed. I felt like I didn't have a care in the world temporarily. Free. That's great. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive. Definitely more assertive. What would you say are some of your best qualities? I would say I'm a wonderful, wonderful friend. I love somebody. I love them very deeply. Friends, family, boyfriend. I think that's good. I'm very loyal as a friend. I'm honest. I care about people. I'm fun to be with. I think those are some of my best qualities. Tell me about your relationship with your family. My relationship with my family, with my father, is not so great. My parents were divorced when I was young. He's sort of been in and out of my life forever. Mostly out. It's not fantastic, but it's something that I'm used to. It's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then I lost him. It's still not the best situation. I still wish that could be remedied somehow. There's good and bad relationships in my family. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. I love someone that's been there for me since I was very, very young. It's always been just incredible. I love her so much. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? 10 or 20 years ago, I would have told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun. So I don't have to work so hard now. Is there anything you regret? I regret exactly that. I regret not taking my career seriously earlier on. Because now it's been much harder. Tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed. I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them. Making them happy. That was probably one of the best times in the last few weeks. Tell me about your kids. They're great kids. Do you find it easy to be a parent? No, I think it's challenging. It is more difficult because they're stepchildren. There are some times when I'm not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved. We're very lucky because they are really good kids. They do tend to fight a lot. But it's not as difficult as I think some other parents have it. That's good. What are some ways that you're different as a parent than your parents? I make a conscious effort not to punish them or overpunish them. I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was screamed at. I was screamed at a lot as a child. It was really difficult so I make sure not to do that. What are you most proud of in your life? I think I'm most proud of the fact that I've been able to travel the world and live in other places, many, many other places around the country and around the world. The fact that I learned several languages. The fact that I've been able to maintain really long, long, long relationships with my friends. Okay, I think I've asked everything on YouTube. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Thank you. Goodbye. Wow.",

I'm not a therapist, but I'm here to learn about people and would love to learn about you. I'll ask you a few questions to get us started. And please feel free to tell me anything. Your answers are fully confidential. Are you okay with this? Yes. Okay. So, how are you doing today? Okay. That's good. Where are you from originally? Virginia. Really? When did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more diversity. How often do you go back to your hometown? Once a year maybe. How does it compare to LA? It's a lot slower and there's a lot less to do there. Why did you move to LA? I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer, warmer climate and somewhere where there's a lot more to do and there's a lot more going on. How easy was it for you to get used to living in LA? For me it was really easy because I wanted something very different and I wanted something different. What are some things you really like about LA? I like all the things to do, like the museums, I like the beaches and the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do. What are some things you don't really like about LA? People that don't appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don't want to give anything back and bad drivers. I'm sure you can tell by my shoes. I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I would like to. I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to that much. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places. My wife and I like to see wildlife and hike and monuments and just seeing different areas. Cool. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. We went to Central California. We'd like to be able to go more internationally but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally. We went to Hearst Castle to see the elephant seals and things like that. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary. We did the tram and a nice hotel on the Jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I guess somewhere in between. What did you study at school? English and film. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, I was told I needed to go to college and I hadn't quite decided what to do yet so I just picked something I liked to do for the time being. Are you happy you did that? Well, I wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to. I might have done something different like physical therapy. Are you still working on that? No, I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before. Wow. What made you decide to do that? I needed to not starve and it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and it ended up being kind of fun. That's good. What's your dream job? Dream job is to have money and not have to work for it. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Overall, pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I don't remember what it was about but it probably would have been a few weeks ago with my wife. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled, I always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone's not listening it drives me crazy. Can you give me an example of that? If I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening, it makes me really upset. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I don't know. I spend a lot of time on them but I don't know what the hardest one is because if I decide to go with something it's usually for a good reason. Uh huh. What's something you feel guilty about? Well, I guess I feel guilty about moving to California and that I left my family in Virginia. I mean, I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there, you know, I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them. How hard is that? Well, I mean, I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a good relationship with my wife, with my in-laws, with my mom, dad and sister. There's no problems. Everyone gets along well. How close are you to your family? Very close. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Um, I mean anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Depends on how much exercise I have. I get a lot of exercise. It's pretty easy. If I don't, it's not. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, kind of like right now just a little bit slowing out of it but not really too different otherwise. Uh huh. How have you been feeling lately? Um, just kind of run down because my mother-in-law is dying and we just spent like three days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep. I'm sorry. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Just slower and more tired and a little more out of it. That's all. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, usually just when I'm having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's pretty easy for me. Just getting outside and hiking or exercising is not hard for me. How would your best friend describe you? I'm not sure. Maybe um, maybe like eccentric but in a good way. Hopefully. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be careful with your job to make sure you can keep from being injured and to, I don't know, just your normal kind of older kind of wisdom. Can you tell me about that? Not much to say really. Everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back in the shape like I used to be. That's the biggest thing right now. Can you tell me more about that? Um, not much to say. Just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it because it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things. That's all. Like what? Well like I used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit because it hurts too much. That sucks. Tell me how you spend your entire weekend. Um, probably like during the day going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then at night you know we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I'm most proud of um, proud of moving here. I mean I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something I regretted but I came out and I've always thought that was a good decision. That's good. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. My parents, my grandparents, my wife, most people in my life have been. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye bye. Okay. I'm going to switch to the other computer where we're going to have you do a quick post-script about your experience.",

I'm not much of a world explorer. Do you travel a lot? Not as much as I would like to. I travel whenever I can but usually can't afford to that much. I understand. What do you enjoy about traveling? I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places. My wife and I like to see wildlife and hike and monuments and just seeing different areas. Cool. I'd love to hear about one of your trips. We went to Central California. We'd like to be able to go more internationally but that takes a while to afford so we've gone more locally. We went to Hearst Castle to see the elephant seals and things like that. Nice. What's one of your most memorable experiences? I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary. We did the tram and a nice hotel on the Jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall. That sounds like a great situation. Do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing? I guess somewhere in between. What did you study at school? English and film. That sounds interesting. How did you decide to do that? Well, I was told I needed to go to college and I hadn't quite decided what to do yet so I just picked something I liked to do for the time being. Are you happy you did that? Well, I wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to. I might have done something different like physical therapy. Are you still working on that? No, I've been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before. Wow. What made you decide to do that? I needed to not starve and it didn't end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and it ended up being kind of fun. That's good. What's your dream job? Dream job is to have money and not have to work for it. Okay. How are you at controlling your temper? Overall, pretty good. When was the last time you argued with someone and what was it about? I don't remember what it was about but it probably would have been a few weeks ago with my wife. Tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differently. Well, anyone that I've ever actually gotten upset and yelled, I always wish I wouldn't do that but sometimes when someone's not listening it drives me crazy. Can you give me an example of that? If I just saying something over and over and they're just clearly not listening, it makes me really upset. Tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make. I don't know. I spend a lot of time on them but I don't know what the hardest one is because if I decide to go with something it's usually for a good reason. Uh huh. What's something you feel guilty about? Well, I guess I feel guilty about moving to California and that I left my family in Virginia. I mean, I know I shouldn't but they always seem to miss me and even though they don't like living there, you know, I'm the one that moved away so it's like I abandoned them. How hard is that? Well, I mean, I don't miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard. Tell me about your relationship with your family. I have a good relationship with my wife, with my in-laws, with my mom, dad and sister. There's no problems. Everyone gets along well. How close are you to your family? Very close. That's good. Tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory. Um, I mean anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise. How easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep? Depends on how much exercise I have. I get a lot of exercise. It's pretty easy. If I don't, it's not. What are you like when you don't sleep well? Um, kind of like right now just a little bit slowing out of it but not really too different otherwise. Uh huh. How have you been feeling lately? Um, just kind of run down because my mother-in-law is dying and we just spent like three days in the hospital and we're going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep. I'm sorry. Have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately? Just slower and more tired and a little more out of it. That's all. Have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD? No. Have you been diagnosed with depression? No. Tell me about the last time you felt really happy. Um, usually just when I'm having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that's pretty easy for me. Just getting outside and hiking or exercising is not hard for me. How would your best friend describe you? I'm not sure. Maybe like eccentric but in a good way. Hopefully. Is there anything you regret? No. What advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago? To be careful with your job to make sure you can keep from being injured and to, I don't know, just your normal kind of older kind of wisdom. Can you tell me about that? Not much to say really. Everyone realizes things when they get older that they wish they had when they were younger. What are some things you wish you could change about yourself? I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back in the shape like I used to be. That's the biggest thing right now. Can you tell me more about that? Um, not much to say. Just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it because it's you know holding me back from doing a lot of things. That's all. Like what? Well like I used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit because it hurts too much. That sucks. Tell me how you spend your entire weekend. Um, probably like during the day going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and wildlife and exercising and then at night you know we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that. What are you most proud of in your life? Um, I'm most proud of moving here. I mean I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something I regretted but I came out and I've always thought that was a good decision. That's good. There's some of it that's been a positive influence in your life. My parents, my grandparents, my wife, most people in my life have been. Okay, I think I've asked everything I need to. Thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Goodbye. Bye bye. Okay. I'm going to switch to the other computer where we're going to have you do a quick post-script about your experience.",
         "Lately, I've been feeling pretty run down, mostly because my mother-in-law is dying, and we've been spending a lot of time in the hospital, which means I haven't had much time to sleep. This lack of sleep makes me feel slower, more tired, and a little more out of it, kind of like I am right now. Beyond that, I carry some guilt about moving to California and leaving my family in Virginia. Even though I know I shouldn't, they always seem to miss me, and it feels a bit like I abandoned them, which is a little hard to deal with. My back injury also holds me back from being as active as I used to be, like with gymnastics, which can be frustrating. When I don't get enough exercise, it's harder for me to sleep well. Despite these feelings, I try to stay active, like going on hikes or to the park with my wife, taking pictures, and enjoying wildlife, and at night, we'll watch a movie or go dancing.",

         "I've been feeling really low for about six months now. It started gradually after a period of high stress at work and a personal loss. My mood is a deep sadness, an emptiness, and I've lost interest in almost everything I used to enjoy. There's a constant feeling of guilt, especially about not being productive or feeling like a burden. Hopelessness often sets in, making it feel like there's no way out, and sometimes I just feel numb or overwhelmingly exhausted. I've also noticed I'm more irritable, snapping at people easily.\n\nDaily life is a huge struggle. I have trouble sleeping, sometimes with insomnia, other times I sleep too much. My appetite has changed, either not eating much or sometimes overeating. I've been isolating myself, avoiding friends and family because I don't have the energy to socialize, and it's hard to pretend I'm okay. Motivation is non-existent; it's incredibly hard to get out of bed, and basic tasks like showering or getting dressed feel overwhelming. My work performance has suffered significantly, with missed deadlines and calling in sick because I can't focus.\n\nPhysically, I'm constantly fatigued and lack energy, and I've experienced physical aches like headaches and stomach issues. My concentration is poor, and I often feel like I have brain fog. My main coping strategy is just trying to get through each day, sometimes just lying in bed or trying to distract myself with TV, though it doesn't really help. I've started seeing a therapist a couple of months ago, and my partner and family have been very supportive, trying to help me, but it's still incredibly difficult.",
